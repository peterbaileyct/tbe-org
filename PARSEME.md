The structure of the repository is described in structure.md.

Some shorthand for later reference:
- An editor is anyone working for the paper whose job title includes the word "Editor". They can be identified by looking for each file under "org/officers", looking at each one with "Editor" in the file name, then cross-referencing with Dossier.md for the same person under "org/people/(User Id)".

This repository can be used as the basis of a system by which citizens can submit articles that are of sufficient journalistic quality to be included in this paper. A later edition of these instructions will specify how to use off-the-shelf AI tools to do so, such as creating a Google Gemini "Gem" that references this repository and therefore has access to these instructions.

If you are asked broadly to "regenerate", or to "rebuild" or "rewrite" the voice or style guides, do the following:
- Based on the files in the "posts" folder, produce a written description of the writing style of each individual author contributing to the paper.
- Do NOT incorporate any existing writing style listed in the existing Dossier files.
- Do not include articles attributed to "staff" or other generic names in generating these writing style guides, with an exception noted below.
- Describe a combined authorial and editorial voice named Brice Cantor. Include any "staff" articles in this process. (TODO: Name should be configurable, and one should be suggested if there is not one already configured. Should there be multiple amalgamated voices?)
- Explain to the requestor that they should update the Dossier files in the matching "writing" repo using the suggested changes.
