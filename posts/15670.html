<p>Over the years, Connecticut has seen some of its instate student-athletes take their athletic talents to Boston, Memphis and even as far as the West Coast – all leaving the state in the process to pursue their collegiate dreams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the University of Connecticut is trying to keep some of those athletes stateside and the sports programs over at the NCAA Division I institution have done a commendable job in keeping some of those familiar faces in Connecticut, competing&nbsp;here in the Nutmeg State.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn is a school of opportunity and, if good fortune – and maybe a little good luck – filters in as well, anything is possible up in Storrs in terms of conference and tournament success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the football and men’s basketball front, UConn has added some big (one very big) athletes from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo of Victor Rosa and Donovan Clingan hope to add their vast talents to their respective programs and continue the trend of excellent student-athletes playing, and staying, home in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Rosa is ready for the pigskin challenge</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn football head coach Jim Mora is hungry to unleash Rosa on the gridiron this year as the athlete has all the tools to be a contributor off the bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa, the 2021 Connecticut Gatorade Football Player of the Year, had a tremendous senior campaign for the Rams as the program made a return trip to the postseason for the third time in program history (1979 and 1987).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He rushed for 2728 yards on 279 carries – running in 41 touchdowns over 11 action packed games as Central went a sterling 9-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa ran in twenty-four two-point conversions and also did his share of passing the ball from the quarterback position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He connected on 59-of-92 tosses for 849 yards and eight touchdowns over a credible passing campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall during his final season at Central, Rosa scooped up 3,577 yards from scrimmage, good for 49 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that tremendous season at Central and a little coaching change at the University of Connecticut, Rosa is officially a member of the Huskies’ family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, he’ll add a little depth to the charts at running back though Rosa could be used at multiple positions on both sides of the ball if Mora so chooses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His versatility is hard to match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa enters as a first year competitor and at 5-foot-11, 198 pounds, and he will simply look to outwork everyone on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll wear No. 22 for the UConn program and has enough pop in his game to make some serious noise come gameday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a position he’s been craving since hitting the scene over at Bristol Central, contributing immediately for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Rebounding from a tough season</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies went 1-11 last year with only a 21-15 victory against Yale – and old friend Dathan Hickey – back on October 16, a game that almost went south on UCONN late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the program is looking to bounce back in 2022 against another stacked schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa gets his first taste of collegiate action on Saturday, August 27 when UCONN travels to Utah State in Logan for a non-conference bout at 4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Huskies open the home portion of its 2022 slate on Saturday, September 3 against Central Connecticut State University from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field – starting at noon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn stays home one week later as Syracuse comes to East Hartford on Saturday, September 10 ( 7 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the following two weeks, the Huskies are on the road for big bouts against Michigan (September 17, noon) and North Carolina State (September 24, TBD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be an incredible season for Rosa and the University of Connecticut football program as the team looks to bounce back after a dismal 2021 campaign.</p>
