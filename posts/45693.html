<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May just keeps getting better and better! It’s all about the Ultra Beast, and here is the latest to help you on your journey. Let’s talk about the Poison Pin Pokémon first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, May 23, at 10 a.m. to Tuesday, May 28, at 8 p.m., Naganadel finally comes to Pokemon GO! Starting with this event, Trainers will be able to evolve Poipole into Naganadel by using 200 Poipole Candy after catching 20 Dragon-type Pokémon with Poipole as their Buddy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucky for us, there are many raids that are happening that are dragon-themed, and they will be popping up all over Bristol! These raids also have shiny encounter too, so when you can, raid them with your fellow Trainers and get those dragons!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to Mega Gyrados from May 16 through May 23, Regirock and Blacephalon are join the raids soon. Both Pokemon are weak to water Pokémon, and Mega Gyrados can make quick work in these raids. Shadow Suicune is available all the way until the end of May. </p>

<p>Per usual, check out these spots:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I did confirm from last week that Solgaleo and Lunala will be feature in the game once again. Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma will make their worldwide Pokémon GO debuts during Day 2 of Pokémon GO Fest 2024: Global in raids.  There are items newly discovered in Pokémon GO, Lunar Fusion Energy and Solar Fusion Energy, can be found during this event. This will allow Trainers to fuse these Pokémon with Necrozma. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon successfully completing a raid, Trainers will have the opportunity to catch Necrozma and then use collected Fusion Energy to fuse Necrozma with Solgaleo to create Dusk Mane Necrozma or Lunala to create Dawn Wings Necrozma!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma will make their worldwide Pokémon GO debuts during Day 2 of Pokémon GO Fest 2024: Global in raids. Trainers will have the opportunity to catch Necrozma in its regular form after defeating Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma in raids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to encountering Necrozma and receiving the typical raid rewards, Trainers will obtain Solar Fusion Energy or Lunar Fusion Energy from Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma raids respectively. Trainers will also receive Cosmog Candy upon successfully completing one of these raids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fusion will be available at in-person events for the first time in Pokémon GO as a one-time opportunity exclusively for ticket-holding Trainers. Fusion Energy will become available globally beginning with Day 2 of Pokémon GO Fest 2024: Global. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trainers with an active Pokémon GO Fest 2024 ticket will be able to participate in Special Research that will grant enough Solar Fusion Energy or Lunar Fusion Energy to fuse Necrozma once depending on their branching quest choice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t miss out on this early opportunity to obtain Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma ahead of Pokemon GO Fest 2024 for the global event. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trainers will have the opportunity to catch Necrozma in its regular form after defeating Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma in raids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure you get the ticket for this event.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
