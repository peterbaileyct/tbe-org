<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team hosted the Spartans from Lewis Mills Monday night in a CCC semi-final, and the Lady Lancers were unable to defend their home turf as a 14-8 loss allowed the Spartans to move on.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A second-half Mills surge that BE had no answer brought on Eastern’s demise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers only trailed by one at the half, 5-4,  but that one goal deficit ballooned to 10-5 at the end of the third quarter.&nbsp; </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fourth period saw both teams trade goals which led to the final score of 14-8. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Erin Martin made several key saves throughout to keep the Lancers in the game without two starting defenders in front of her.&nbsp; Jayna Hatcher and Meg Krok were left to battle with a variety of substitute players at their sides and the Lewis Mills offense exposed those vulnerabilities.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were paced by Harper Dauphinee and Emma Stavens with three goals apiece.&nbsp; Vanessa Drury and Kate Patterson each pitched in with a goal.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers picked up a last-second goal at the end of the third quarter as Savannah Drury connected from the goal line on a pass to Emma Stavens.&nbsp; That goal seemed to spur the Lancer's momentum as they picked up two more to make it 10-7, but the Spartans quickly answered with three of their own to make it 13-7.&nbsp; </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final few minutes, both teams played end-to-end and traded goals for the final score of 14-8.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern now awaits their seeding for the state tournament which will begin next week.</p>
