<p>The Bristol Blues are feeling anything but blue in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Blues are riding high in the Western Division of the New England Collegiate Baseball League - the only program in the West with a winning record as of Saturday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is 20-7 overall and is 6.5 games in front of the Valley Blue Sox, in second place at 14-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Danbury Westerners (12-16) sit 8.5 games in back of Bristol and the North Adams SteepleCats (6-20) are at the bottom of the standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is 7-3 over its past 10 games, doing a masterful job at winning all the close ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the July 4 break, Bristol was scheduled to square off against North Adams on the road but rain foiled those aspirations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game has been rescheduled to July 16 at 4 p.m. as part of a doubleheader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Wednesday and Thursday, the Blues wrapped up a couple one-run victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Bristol welcomed Danbury to the friendly confines of Muzzy and guess what happened?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues were forced into extra innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol led 3-2 going into the top of the ninth but could not hold onto the edge as the Westerner’s notched a run - making it a 3-3 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to Danbury’s credit, Nick Romano’s RBI single gave the visiting aggression a 4-3 lead midway through the tenth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol had a response as Tyler Fote and Ryan Wilson scored the tying and winning runs as the home team zipped up the win in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fote went 2-of-4 with a run and two RBI while Andrew Calhoun was 2-for-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chaz Myers had a day, going 2-of-4 with two runs scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Jagger Duquette had another tremendous day on the hill despite earning a no decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw 5.2 sterling innings that included only four hits, six strikeouts and no earned runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tommy Benincaso took home the win (1.1 IP, 3 Ks) as the Blues grabbed another one run victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, it was another one of those one-run games for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, it was only a nine inning affair as Bristol defeated the Newport Gulls, 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol put in a three-spot over the fourth frame and that’s all the home team needed to win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the victory came off the power of a three-run home run by Joseph Rios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Wilson walked and after Ben Huber singled, two were on for Rios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His three-run homer propelled Bristol to a 3-0 lead through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That one hit allowed Bristol starter Colin McVeigh to leave the game ahead on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol gave up single runs to Newport in the six and eighth innings but Luke Garofalo (1 IP, 2 Ks) roped up the save that put the locals on a two-game winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Friday, Bristol fell at the Marthas Vineyard Sharks 12-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sharks zapped the Blues for 17 hits as Bristol used seven pitchers that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t all bad as Bristol shot out to a 3-0 edge through five frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marthas notched six runs in both the sixth and eighth innings to snare a 12-3 cushion going into the ninth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Jay Harry (4-of-5, three RBI), Ben Huber (2-for-5, two RBI), and Jack Lynch (2-of-5, run) all tallied multi-hit games while Josh Spiegel slapped out his first home run of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reed Mascolo (5 IP, three hits, 4 Ks) did not factor into the decision for Bristol as MT Morrissey (0.1 IP, 4 ER) drew a tough loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to end the week on Saturday, Bristol got to the pay window via another one-run win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues dropped Danbury by a 3-2 final for victory No. 20 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a run, Bristol scored twice in the eighth to snare a 3-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With ducks on the pond, Griffin Arnone smacked out a double, scoring Harry and Fote, as Bristol went in front for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boston Smith (2-of-3, RBI) and Arnone (2-of-4, run, two RBI) led the way offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alec Couture (1.1 IP, two hits, 2 Ks) won the game out of the bullpen while Luke Garofalo (1 IP, 2 Ks) nabbed the save for the Blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This Week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is only home twice this week with games from Muzzy Field on Sunday and Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the Blues square off against Valley at 5:30 p.m. and then on Thursday, North Adams is in town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6:30 p.m.</p>
