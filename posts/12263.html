<p>BRISTOL – After a tremendous 2021 campaign, the softball program at Bristol Central sees a majority of the squad back for another go-around.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means the Rams are in pretty good shape right off the bat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will go back to its impressive two-headed monster in the circle as juniors Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto are going to give opponents plenty of headaches for the second straight campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the offense can match that outstanding defense, the Rams are going to be an extremely tough out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at the Bristol Central softball team in 2022:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL SOFTBALL&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Monica Hayes (7th season. In six seasons, Hayes is 71-55 overall)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 season</strong>: 16-5 overall. Ranked No. 11 in the Class L tournament in 2021, the Rams lost in second round action to No. 6 Ledyard by a 3-0 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Losses</strong>: Gwen Torreso (SS), Kayla St. Onge (1B), Brooke Soucy (3B), Emily Ericson (OF), Kayleigh Dionne (2B), Janessa Bartell (OF/3B)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Returning Players</strong>: Gabby Buonafede (sr, INF), Ryleigh Hall (sr, OF), Sarah Romano (sr, INF/UTL), Lorelei Stancavage (jr, C), Kaley Laird (jr, INF), Sam Sklenka (jr, OF), Leah Sklenka (so, OF), Sophia Torreso (jr, P/1B), Alex Sciarretto (jr, P/3B), Mya Porrini (fr, INF), Adrianna Lubrico (jr, INF).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Season Outlook</strong>: When you have two scholastic stars in the circle, then your softball program is already in tremendous shape.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s what’s waiting for opponents this season as Central Connecticut Conference programs will have double-trouble with the Torreso/Sciarretto duo. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both pitchers will split time again in the circle,” said Hayes. “[I’m] looking forward to a big year from both of them.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto was an CCC South All-Conference performer last season and expect Torreso to join her in the ranks after this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The great thing for the Rams is when one chucker gets into any kind of trouble, there’s another varsity level performer ready to throw strikes which is a luxury very few squads in the state enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But both players will man infield positions when the other is throwing and the duo brings fearsome offensive games to the dish as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catching for the twosome will be junior Lorelei Stancavage and the defensive standout is poised to have a big campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lorelei Stancavage should shine both offensively and defensively,” said Hayes of her signal caller behind the plate. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seniors Gabby Buonafede (infield), Ryleigh Hall (outfield), and Sarah Romano (infield/utility) will factor into the offense while All-Conference standout, junior Kaley Laird, brings her glove back to the infield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outfield is in fine shape with junior Sam Sklenka and sophomore Leah Sklenka ready to compete and when Torreso and Sciarretto are pitching, freshman Mya Porrini and junior Adrianna Lubrico will fill in when called upon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most impressive part of Central’s program last season was its defense which shouldn’t skip a beat in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams lost its five games by just 21 runs last year and dropped three contests by three runs or less.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those defensive numbers might be tough to duplicate with an imposing slate of games but once Central reaches the postseason, after that grueling CCC schedule, the locals will be looking for a long playoff jaunt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We want to be postseason prepared so this 1-2 [CCC position] schedule will help,” said Hayes. “Overall, we’re looking to win more than one state tourney game.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch: </strong>Central, due to its fantastic play over the recent years, has one heck of a scholastic slate to contend with this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams first game is on the road against Newington this Wednesday at 4 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other tough road contests include trips to Berlin (April 16), South Windsor (May 16), and then Central takes it shot at Southington (May 18) in a huge CCC Interdivisional bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the middle of all the tomfoolery, Central tangles with non-conference challenger Pomperaug in Bristol on Thursday, April 21.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, to the delight of local media, Central’s battles against Bristol Eastern won’t come on the same days as their baseball counterparts - unless the weather changes things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams take their first crack against Lancers on May 6 and then have a rematch against the Kingstreeters on Friday, May 20.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a tougher schedule this year, we have the 1-2 schedule, so it will be a challenge, but a welcome one for sure,” said Hayes. “Berlin and Platt both will compete for the conference. We anticipate being in the mix as well.”</p>
