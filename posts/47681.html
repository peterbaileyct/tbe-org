<p>Continuing community engagement is high on the list of priorities for Bristol’s new Chief of Police Mark Morello.</p>

<p>"It is an honor and privilege to have been selected as the Chief of Police for the City of Bristol," Morello said in an email to the Bristol Edition.</p>

<p>"I am very excited to continue my 24-year career here with the Bristol Police Department," he writes. "My goals include increasing our community engagement."</p>

<p>Morello specifically mentioned providing "robust" support for mental health and addiction service needs and homelessness and adapting new technologies to keep the community safe and increase efficiency.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, he writes, "I also hope to increase the size of the number of personnel we are allocated to better meet the demands of the city, especially with all the new downtown development that is taking place."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He thanked all those involved in the hiring process, including the mayor, police commissioners and city council for their confidence in him.</p>

<p>City Council made Morello's appointment official last night in a special council meeting. Morello has been acting chief since the retirement of former Police Chief Brian Gould in April.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
