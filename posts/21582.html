<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team nearly led New Britain wire to wire on Wednesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the pesky Hurricanes managed to stay in the game despite sub-par shooting until the very end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters managed to scoop up a big 40-31 CCC Interdivisional win from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 3-4 on the campaign while the Hurricanes (4-2) lost for just the second time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern senior standout Taigan Parent dropped in a career-high 17 points to go along with two rebounds, two assists and four steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then teammate Autumn Udoh had another one of her amazing video game stat-lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming off the bench, Udoh blasted New Britain for 13 points, 16 rebounds, seven blocks and five steals over another tremendous effort by the first-year competitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury added five points and three rebounds, Lauren Ayotte nabbed two points and six rebounds and while Leah Roy notched just a single point, the jack-of-all-trades forward did a ton on the court for the Lancers that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scooped in 12 rebounds, three assists and rejected a couple shots to help Eastern to its third win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three players for New Britain scored six points - the high for the squad that was limited to just nine points at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hurricanes shot a miserable 19.4-percent from the field but made 18 steals to keep the home program from greatly extending the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by two early, Drury canned a hoop, Parent followed with a lay-up and when Udoh notched her first basket with 3:25 left in the first, Eastern scooped up a 6-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain's Malia Burgos's three pointer with 40 seconds left in the period made it 6-5 contest after one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern used a 7-0 jaunt to open the second stanza - making it a 13-5 game with 5:14 remaining before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that run, Parent did all the scoring.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel found the senior for a slick fallaway jumper, later drained a 3 and when her third straight shot fell in, New Britain was trailing by eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the half, Ayotte flipped in her basket and Drury went 1-of-2 from the charity stripe as Eastern held a 18-9 push at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent’s jumper to open the third tilt propelled Eastern’s to its biggest lead at 11 and when Udoh canned a turnaround with 3:35 to play in the frame, it was a 26-16 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown turned chippy from there, the Hurricanes went on a 9-0 burst and just one minute into the final period, New Britain was knocking at the door - trailing just 26-25.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Hurricanes went nearly 5:30 without a point as Eastern’s defense held the fort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 9-0 dash from the Lancers, started by a Udoh lay-up and finished with a Parent free throw, pushed it back to double figures again (35-25) with 4:22 remaining in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain chopped the deficit to 35-31 with 1:20 to play but Udoh made a full court dash to score - dropping in a huge runner - to give the Lancers a bit of a cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hurricanes were then forced to foul the rest of the way in an attempt to get possession of the ball back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And charity tosses by Parent and Roy closed out the game with Eastern coming away a big 40-31 winner in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
