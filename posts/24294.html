<p>Paul “Papa” Matyka, 72, of Bristol, passed away on Monday, March 20, at UConn Hospital surrounded by family and friends. Paul was born on Feb. 3, 1951, son of the late Wallace and Eleanor (Russo) Matyka. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul was a thoughtful, kindhearted, beloved, husband of Diana “Dee” Valerio-Matyka. He served in the National Guard from 1964 to 1970 as a mechanic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He not only made a huge impact on all of our lives, but also left us with a lifetime of memories and love to cherish and hold onto so deeply. Paul started his career in the automotive industry working as a “master” mechanic. He worked at various local dealerships.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul started riding motorcycles at an early age, which lead him to open his first and most current shop around the late 70s, on Riverside Avenue, Riverside Cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Motorcycles were more than hobby, they were a lifestyle that he loved and made him the person he was. Later he raced motorcycles all across the east coast and at many other tracks east of the Mississippi.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul’s reputation was not only national but he had customers in Europe and Australia. If anyone had a motorcycle question he was the “go to guy.” He was generous, sharing his knowledge with anyone who asked, from street riders to professional racers. In his racing career, he set national and world records. It never went to his head it all went to his heart. As a family, we hope he is riding his dream Harley through the heavenly golden gates, with a helmet on of course. </p>

<p>Paul was the type of person that could fix any problem, day or night no matter what it was. If there was a will, there was a way. “No big deal” or “Let's take a look at it” would be his response. He was the most laidback, calm, cool, and collected person we have ever met. In fact, I don’t think we will ever be so lucky to meet anyone who will fit that criteria again. “Paul could fix anything but our broken hearts."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides his wife, Paul is survived by his children Erik Matyka of Terryville, Kristin Wojenski and her husband Steven of Bristol and Michael Valerio and his wife Amy of Bristol; grandchildren Molly and Colby Wojenski, Maximilian and Mason Valerio and many good friend. Paul will be deeply missed by everyone who was lucky enough to have been in his life.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
