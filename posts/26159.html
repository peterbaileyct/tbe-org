<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern baseball team finally got back to the pay window on Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After going bankrupt over three straight games, the Lancers collected handsomely against Middletown – posting a 10-3 victory against the Blue Dragons from Clem J. Roy Field on the campus of BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the win, the Kingstreeters moved to 4-9 overall while Middletown fell to 9-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scooped up 11 hits over the tilt compared to just five for the visiting aggression.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern’s top-three in the batting order were responsible for over half of those tallies.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White led the attack with three hits while Connor Cyr and Ben D’Amato each added two hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio pitched the first six innings for Eastern and threw extremely well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just three hits and one earned run while striking out eight to earn the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once Eastern grabbed the edge in the fray, there was no turning back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored twice in the first inning and added four runs in the second stanza to post a big 6-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first, White led off with an infield single, promptly stealing second.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr followed with a base hit through the left side of the infield to put runners on the corners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato then singled to the right side of the field to score White, making it a 1-0 affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jose Feliciano later drove in Cyr with a single to left as Eastern took a quick 2-0 lead through one inning of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One frame later, Eastern went back on the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, White singled to right and Cyr and D'Amato both walked as the bases were loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio lined a base hit to center to score White, Feliciano walked to force in Cyr, and then Mason Harris lined a single to right to score D'Amato and Maglio, propelling Eastern to a 6-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio, after yielding two hits in the first inning, retired eight straight batters through the third inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively,&nbsp;Eastern catcher Rio Fernandez, White at shortstop and&nbsp;Jed Sutula at second base all had strong games in the field to lead the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Middletown fourth, the visitors loaded the bases with two outs following two walks and an infield error.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when Maglio generated the last out of the frame on a pop-up to second, the Blue Dragons could not put a dent on the scoreboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, in the Middletown fifth with two away, the visitors cobbled something together.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error and a walk put two runners on, and Caleb Reed's double scored the duo to trim the deficit to 6-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the bottom of the fifth, Eastern put another four-spot on the board to ice the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a walk, a single to center by Kyle Babin, and an error on White's grounder, Eastern had the bases loaded with no one out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr then doubled to left center to score two runs and D'Amato followed with his own two-base hit to right center to notch a couple more to help the Lancers secure a 10-2 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio pitched through the sixth, reaching the pitch limit, before Declan Schenck threw the seventh frame, allowing the final Middletown run to close out the 10-3 victory for the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back in action this Friday evening to square off against Plainville in the one and only showdown between the local programs this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game takes place at Plainville’s High School baseball diamond starting at 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The game against Middletown was Eastern’s 1,250<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;contest in program history. The Lancers have won just over .600 of those game since becoming a team in 1960…The Kingstreeters are 14-5 all-time against Middletown.&nbsp;</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
