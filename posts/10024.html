<p>BRISTOL - If you don’t think the boys basketball program over at Bristol Central is serious about competing for a CIAC Division II championship, you haven’t been paying enough attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Division II is loaded with the likes of Conard, Simsbury, Amity, Crosby, Stratford, Westhill, and Prince Tech all strong competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those could be some challenging teams come the playoffs for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Division I is loaded for bear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams that will contend for a state championship includes Notre Dame-West Haven, Norwich Free Academy, Wilbur Cross, Naugatuck, Manchester, and old friend Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, was there any real consideration about Central bumping up to Division I to take on an even tougher slate of postseason challengers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;It simply wasn’t necessary with the schedule Central plays this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Between scrimmages and regular season, we play seven out of the twenty teams in Division I,” said Barrette. “If you’re already playing seven teams, I don’t know what the advantage is about [moving] up. We’ve already played those teams.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central scrimmaged New Britain to open the year and East Catholic was looked upon many as possibly, the second-best squad in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That all ended after Central dropped the Eagles by a 74-59 final from Mohegan Sun last Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The East Catholic program is also in Division I.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford is on the docket January 7, Wilbur Cross battles the Rams on February 2, and then in a CCC Tournament rematch from last season, Central travels to battle Windsor on February 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there’s another Catholic school that is even a bigger threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And guess what, that other Catholic program resides right in Division II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To be honest, the second-best team in the state to me is Northwest Catholic and they’re in our division,” said Barrette. “So, I mean, we’re going to get tested up and down our schedule.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with all due respect to East Catholic, does Bristol Central have an equal in the state of Connecticut?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 14, the Rams - in fact - leave the state to battle Springfield Central from Springfield College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those regular season contests will prepare the Rams for the ultimate prize: a shot at the CIAC Division II title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our job is to be there at the end of the year” in the championship round said Barrette. “We had an opportunity to play at Mohegan Sun in our second game of the season [against East Catholic] and our message is definitely we want to finish our season there as well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The finals will take place, as always, from the Mohegan Sun Arena over the weekend of March 19-20.</p>
