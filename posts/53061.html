<p>A GoFundMe page has raised over $96,000 of a $100,000 goal for the family of the late Robert Sharkevich, Sr., a firefighter who lost his life battling the Hawthorne Fire on Lamentation Mountain in Berlin.</p>

<p>"It is with profound sadness that we mourn the loss of one of our bravest, Firefighter Robert 'Rob' Sharkevich St., known as 'Sharky,'" writes the organizer of the fundraiser and Sharkevich's sister Karen Letizio.</p>

<p>Sharkevich was killed Oct. 22 when the utility vehicle he was driving overturned on a steep incline. A funeral Mass was held yesterday, Oct. 28, at the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Hartford.</p>

<p>"Rob is survived by his wife and four children, including two, who are seniors in high school soon to be enrolled in college," Letizio writes. "Please donate what you can share this message far and wide. Let's show the Sharkevich family that they are not alone."</p>

<p>She adds, "Every dollar donated will directly support the Sharkevich family to ensure they don't have to worry about immediate family needs and financial security while grieving this devastating loss."</p>
