<p>Come Sunday morning, the remnants of storm Ian will be in the air, whipped up winds, some rain fall, cooler temperatures. One of the events that has been affected around here will have been the weekly Bristol Farmers’ Market. It just so happens that TBE had a tent there on Saturday. Jack and Anna, Rit and I made an appearance. Most of the vendors held off, since the weather report called for rain.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We made the most of it. Some regular farmers’ market goers stopped by to chat and sign up if they haven’t already. A couple of people had connections to Florida and talked about the devastation there—a summer residence a quarter of the mile from the ocean, just high enough not to have any water damage, a broken window that allowed the rains in causing a different type of water damage. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(On another note: Bristolites on the scene have left cryptic messages on Facebook about the internet being out, assessing damage, and such. I do not pretend to understand the devastation and what people are going through. I can offer hope and prayers for a safe recovery. This is the beginning of a long road back for so many people.)</p>

<p>Early on, after we set up, Rit chatted up the mayor and he came by our tent where he agreed to a photo. Overall, it was a good morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Wheeler Clinic broke ground on its new headquarters downtown. The event attracted over 100 state and local officials, board members, donors and employees on Thursday. The 46,000 sq. ft. health center and administrative office building will occupy 1.3 acres between North Main and Hope streets. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across the street, work continues on city hall, which is being renovated. Up the street, the Assisted Living Care building is shaping up. Lots of building going on, lots more to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The big news, of course, is the upcoming mid-term elections. TBE intends to begin its coverage next week with some background about the candidates. From there we plan to approach candidates for their positions on issues important to our readers. The hope is that our readers will let us know that some of the pressing issues are. Please email <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a> with your important issues. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, we do publish letters to the editor. If you would like to participate through letters, include “letter to the editor” in the subject line and follow our guidelines for letters: Under 450 words, no name calling, focus on issues, provide contact information, including an address and phone number for verification purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the family, the youngest son and Allison have begun their own travel blog, GrAl. The first full post features Pizza Friday, a family tradition, and some of the issues associated with continuing that tradition in Australia. Without ruining the fun, consider the oven—in Australia it’s different than the ones we are used to here in the States.

<p>Listening and reading this week, once again were relatively limited. I did get to one article in The New Yorker about the anniversary of the publication of T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land.” It’s a bit esoteric reading, but still fun to read about the background of one of the enduring poems of the last 100 years. Click <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/books/review/robert-crawford-eliot-after-the-waste-land.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> to read.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listening once again revolves around a new podcast called “Capital Isn’t,” which originates from the Chicago School of Economics and this week discusses the history of anti-trust laws, “Anti-Trust—The Story of Declining Enforcement.” It’s a bit wonky, so you have been warned.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email </em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em> <em>People with financial difficulties may write </em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
