Five arrests were made and were tried before Judge Newell and settled for two dollars plus court costs.</p>

<p>Rev. John F. Nichols was also accused of riding on the walk. He denied the charge, stating that he confined himself to the bicycle path alongside the walk. The judge postponed the case and made a personal inspection. He found the walk very rough and alongside it a smooth path used by wheeled vehicles. Deciding that it would be poor judgment to take to the walk for riding purposes, the judge dismissed the charges.</p>
