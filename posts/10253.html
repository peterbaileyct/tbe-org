<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central girls basketball team might still be chasing that first victory into the New Year but the Rams have been right in the thick of things despite its 0-5 start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And scores have been close as four of the squads first five games this year were losses by 10 points or less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been playing well," said Central coach Steve Gaudet after the loss to Gilbert last Thursday. “The other night against Middletown, we’re down five against one of the better trams we’re going to play all year with the ball late in the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams fell at Rocky Hill (39-35) to open the season on December 14 while losing to South Windsor by 19 points (53-34) three days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals then lost to RHAM (46-36) and Middletown (59-49) but made games out of each of those encounters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had momentum from last season, nearly pulling off the CCC Division 4 Tournament championship and had things lined up quite nicely for the Bristol Central Holiday Classic to end December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hope was the program from Bristol would get a little momentum through a four-pack of winnable games and draw even on the season, starting with a showdown against Innovation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But COVID mucked things up in a big way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Innovation program – winless on the season – withdrew from tournament play, leaving the Rams without an opponent on December 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Central battled Gilbert of Torrington down to the wire on December 30, falling by a 62-56 score over a very winnable contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams trailed by 19 late in the third period but eventually drew even before running out of steam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why that 0-5 ledger is deceiving as could be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made this comeback,’ said Gaudet against Gilbert. “They’ve [the players] just got to see us put more points on the scoreboard than the other team for confidence. We’re playing better than our record.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central has weapons, including senior Lillian Sirois – the program’s leading scorer at 17.4 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in a career-high 24 against Gilbert which was almost enough to topple the Torrington squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams missed Leilani Jackson-Mills (7.0 ppg) that night but the likes of Ariana Rivera (7.0 points-per-game), Brooke Watson (6.0 ppg), Callie Lodovico (4.2 ppg), and Ella Watson (2.4 ppg) have made the season a competitive one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program, outside of the South Windsor setback, has shown flashes of what the team could be this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am very happy with the team’s effort, chemistry and our defense,” said Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is looking forward to its showdown against Plainville tonight at 6 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils (1-6) lost six straight to open the season before scooping up a 65-10 victory in the consolation round of its holiday tournament last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central sneaks in a road game against New Britain on Wednesday before the Rams enjoy three straight games from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Friday, Central battles a Hartford Public team that is also struggling before squaring off against a solid Platt team next Tuesday (January 11) and Maloney on Thursday (January 13).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s just a matter of time before Central seizes that first win which should get everything moving in the right direction for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Once we get that first win, and we get the ball rolling, it’s going to pick up some steam,” said Gaudet. “I’ve got some confident kids and some kids with skill and I think once we get that win, and we get over that hump, I like where we’re going to be.”</p>
