<p>BROOKFIELD – Before the state tournament commenced, Bristol Eastern softball coach Tyler Catlin made a bold prediction about how his squad was going to be a team no one wanted to face in the Class L playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Tuesday night, that premonition came to pass as No. 21 Bristol Eastern upset No. 12 Brookfield by a 5-2 final on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory propelled the Lancers to 11-10 overall on the season and earned the squad another game in the Class L fray.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern advances on to battle No. 5 Jonathan Law (19-2 regular season) today at 3 p.m. in Milford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The public school team defeated No. 28 Killingly (5-2) on Tuesday in another first round showdown but the program from the SCC is in for a stern challenge against Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday’s game at Brookfield (14-7) saw Ali Tellier pitch another complete game gem that included five strikeouts and no walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Janessa Gonzalez posted a two-RBI double while Alex Shorette added two hits to spur the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also threw out a runner trying to score on a sacrifice fly as Eastern’s defense was sharp over first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with that victory, the Bristol Eastern softball program gets to compete into the month of June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Kingstreeters can pull off the same type of magic today in Milford, a possible date against No. 4 East Haven is in the mix over quarterfinal play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are one of three teams that pulled off first round upsets in Class L yesterday, joining No. 25 Edwin O. Smith – a 5-3 winner over No. 8 RHAM – in advancing while No. 20 Torrington spun No. 13 Wethersfield by a 5-2 push.</p>
