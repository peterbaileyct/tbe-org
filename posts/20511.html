<p>The University of Connecticut’s football program held its 2022 awards banquet this past week as the outfit was awaiting its bowl fate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season isn’t over, but several athletes were recognized for their outstanding contributions to a squad that ended the regular season at 6-6 - its best ledger since 2015.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the offensive end, a certain standout athlete from Bristol was one of the many award winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa earned the Rookie of the Year Award over his outstanding season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa played in the final 11 regular season games for the Huskies - scoring half of the squad’s 18 rushing touchdowns in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made 124 carries, scooping up 561 yards and nine touchdowns which all ended up being team-leading totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa churned out 51 yards a game, averaging 4.5 yards-per-carry and had one of his carries go for a season-high 61 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 5-foot-11, 198-pound bulldog started off the campaign with limited attempts but by the time the regular season was completed, Rosa was an indispensable part of the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied two touchdowns in three games and over second half play as Rosa was running here, there and everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with the FIU showdown, Rosa scooped in 453 total yards on 87 carries (5.2 yards-per-carry) that led to seven TDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when UConn was making its run to the postseason, Rosa was a big reason for that success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made a season-high 17 rushes against both Ball St. and UMASS while tearing up Army at West Point for 12 carries for 111 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s going to happen when the Huskies get to its bowl game and Rosa gets one more chance to strut his stuff?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa also made several kickoff returns this season, scooping up a team-leading 259 yards on 14 returns (18.5 yards-per-return) while making nine punt returns for 53 yards - also a team high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been tremendous on, and off the field, in UConn’s rebirth on the gridiron under head coach Jim Mora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Rosa and the Huskies are done competing on the field, the freshman will be able to watch his buddy Donovan Clingan dunk all over the competition on the basketball court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bowl opponent set</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, UConn’s bowl game was finally revealed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Huskies are headed to Myrtle Beach which is not a bad place to spend the holidays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn will travel to South Carolina to battle Marshall on December 19 in the Myrtle Beach Bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the first bowl game for the program from Storrs since the Huskies lost to Marshall back in 2015 at the St. Petersburg Bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn dropped that contest 16-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heading into the bowl game, the Huskies are 3-3 overall in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest against Marshall (8-4 overall) commences from the campus of Coastal Carolina University.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kickoff is set for 2:30 p.m. and will be broadcast live on ESPN.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Marshall was the former home of Bristol Eastern basketball standout Daijia Brooks who played four years of ball for the women’s program (2015-2020)…Marshall’s football program was on board the Southern Airways Flight 932 that crashed and killed 37 players and several coaches back on November 14, 1970.&nbsp;</p>
