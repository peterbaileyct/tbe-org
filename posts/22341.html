<p>WETHERSFIELD - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team couldn’t get over the hump against Wethersfield on Tuesday night, dropping a tough 57-48 decision to fall to 6-8 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles improved to 5-9 overall with the win, simply coming out on fire and never letting the Kingstreeters grab a hold of the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Vanessa Drury had a big game, dropping in 15 points, while Taigan Parent notched 10 of her 12 points over fourth period play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the senior captain, try as she could, wasn’t able to dig the Lancers out of a sizable hole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh also canned 12 points to go along with her usual quota of rebounds and blocked shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield’s Mackenzie Mori led all scorers with 24 points while Vanessa Venditti added 15 to lead the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern tried to hang around even after allowing the home team a 20-point first quarter - leading to a five point push for the Eagles (20-15) through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second stanza, Udoh dropped in a missed shot for two and when Drury banked in a lay-up, Eastern trailed just 22-19 with about 5:40 left in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s when the game went sideways a bit for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield ended the half with a big 14-3 burst, with Mori flipping in 17 of her 24 points over the first two periods, and at intermission the Eagles held an imposing 36-22 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers defense never wavered as Wethersfield was limited to just five third period points but through three quarters, it was a 41-30 contest as the Eagles were still in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, even after the Kingstreeters reduced the deficit to single digits, its was a bit too late as Eastern absorbed a tough 57-48 setback on the road.</p>
