<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central girls soccer program, the 2022 CCC South Champions, are gearing up for postseason play after getting a taste of the playoffs in the recent CCC Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In semifinal round action last Wednesday from Southington High School, Central and Wethersfield went the distance, 0-0, and had to resort to penalty kicks to declare a winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles took that match, 3-1 to advance to the CCC Championship round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it’s time to commence CIAC Class L play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are in the mix with some tough programs, earning a 18th place ranking at 9-5-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central hits the road on Tuesday and will square off against No. 15 Holy Cross in a first-round bout from Waterbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have the firepower to upset the Crusaders with many weapons at its disposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it’s Abby Hansen, Rachel Wygant, Ava Bouchard, Abby Quintero, Beccy Litwinczk or Christina Browne - who can play up front from time to time - Central has the firepower to keep up with just about any opponent offensively.</p>
