<p><em>Editor's note: While most of us, whether we are religious nor not, celebrate the holiday of Christmas on Dec. 25, our Jewish friends will be observing Chanukah beginning on Dec. 18. Many people are not aware of the origins and meaning of Chanukah, so TBE is pleased to offer you the following article about Chanukah from Rabbi Alana Wasserman of Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregation in Southington.</em></p>

<p>​On the evening of Dec. 18,&nbsp;(corresponding to the Hebrew calendar date of&nbsp;25 Kislev 5783), Jewish people around the world will celebrate the first night of Chanukah. We will light the first candle&nbsp;of our Chanukiah (a&nbsp;9-branched candelabra, also known as a Chanukah menorah), play dreidel, and eat latkes (potato pancakes fried in oil).&nbsp;Most importantly, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;retell the story of Chanukah.</p>

<p>​While the holiday of Chanukah is a fun, lighthearted celebration, the story of Chanukah is much more serious. It&nbsp;is about fighting for religious freedom in the face of persecution. It&nbsp;is a story whose message rings true for us today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​In the second century BCE, Israel was ruled by&nbsp;King Antiochus, leader of the&nbsp;Seleucids. It was their mission to force all the Jewish people to Hellenize, thereby renouncing their own faith. If they did not convert, they&nbsp;faced&nbsp;death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​The Seleucid army was large,&nbsp;with massive weaponry. Yet, that did not stop a small band of Jews from forming their own army. Led by Judah the Maccabee&nbsp;(which means “hammer”), the tiny Maccabee army, with its limited&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of weapons and manpower, miraculously defeated&nbsp;the Seleucid army.&nbsp;After they won&nbsp;the Maccabean Revolt, the Jewish people returned to the Temple, only to find that it had been defiled by the Seleucid army.&nbsp;While cleaning the Temple, they discovered that there was not enough oil to light the menorah (the 7-branched candelabra). There was only enough oil to last for one day, but&nbsp;another miracle happened – the oil&nbsp;lasted for eight days. That is&nbsp;why, at Chanukah, we light a 9-branched menorah (one helper candle, called a “shamash,” and 8&nbsp;candles to represent the eight days).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​While the Maccabees were able to defeat the Seleucids,&nbsp;they were not able to eradicate&nbsp;anti-Semitism.&nbsp;Hate and prejudice&nbsp;have&nbsp;continued to pervade our world.&nbsp;That is why the story of Chanukah is still so important. It is a reminder for all of us to keep fighting&nbsp;against hate, no matter the odds.&nbsp;Whenever we&nbsp;witness prejudice, we must stand up and speak out, even if no one else does.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​One of the best ways to fight anti-Semitism is&nbsp;not with heated words and weapons, but&nbsp;with things like&nbsp;latkes, dreidels, candles, and prayers. Celebrating&nbsp;our holidays&nbsp;is the best way&nbsp;to combat&nbsp;hate.&nbsp;By participating in Jewish life, we are&nbsp;not allowing fear and hate to dictate our future.&nbsp;Teaching others about our holidays and traditions will help as well.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
