<p>BRISTOL – The Plainville softball team was able to surprise CCC South rival Bristol Central last season, just over 365 days ago, seizing a 3-2 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fast forward to Wednesday in a rematch between the squads and there wouldn’t be any surprises this time around against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, behind the power of standout pitcher Alex Sciarretto, allowed the Blue Devils just three hits and a single run as the program downed Plainville by a 13-1 final in five innings from the softball field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the victory, Central improved to a perfect 4-0 while Plainville (2-2) fell for the second time in two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville only managed to hit two balls out of the infield as Sciarretto piled up five Ks and allowed just one walk while Plainville batted just .150 (3-of-20) for the game.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I felt really good today,” said Sciarretto. “I’ve been sick for the past two days so coming back today, my team was behind me and knowing that I always have a team for defense and offense is really nice.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s defense was sound for most of the outing but when Plainville could have taken advantage of a couple gaffes by the Rams in the field, perhaps even having the opportunity to tie the game up, only minimal damage was inflicted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made a couple errors but we made play after play on top of that,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “We played some good defense. Plainville put the ball in play a lot so they forced us to make plays and I was pleased with our efforts especially our response when we did have a few errors and some misplayed balls. But our response to that was we came out and shut them down.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-2-3 inning by Central to open the first frame, it was time for the locals to put a little offense on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went for three runs in the bottom of the first to seize a 3-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Sam Sklenka (2-for-3, two runs) out-ran a bunt hit, eventually leading to a two-out rally for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto (1-for-2, two runs, two walks) dropped a one-hopper into right field to put runners on the corners and from there, Pia Torreso slipped a two-hopper to right – plating Sklenka – as the home team led 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Lorelei Stancavage (1-for-2, sac fly, four RBI) lofted a Texas Leaguer just behind second to clear the bases as her two-RBI tally gave Central a 3-0 push through one completed inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Alexis Graft drew a one-out walk in the second but eventually was tagged out leaving second base on a fielder’s choice, off a slick tag by Adrianna Lubrico, as the Blue Devils were quickly back in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Central didn’t net a run in the second, Plainville made things interesting in the third – trimming the deficit to two and putting runners on second and third off miscues made in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Amanda Linnhoff dropped in a base hit to left to score Natalie Root, making it a 3-1 contest and the Blue Devils continued to threaten, putting runners on second and third with two away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Sciarretto induced a fly-ball out on Nora Couture as Central escaped its only jam of the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got out of that inning [only] allowing the one run,” said Hayes of the third inning. “And two errors and a 3-0 count…I think to give up only one run in that scenario – especially as it was only 3-1 at that point – that’s pretty efficient.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Sklenka (2-for-4) opened up the bottom of the third with an infield hit that bounced off relief pitcher Kali Fangiullo’s glove over to shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the ball was thrown away at first base, Sklenka ended up at second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto and Torreso then drew back-to-back base-on-balls to load up things up with Stancavage on deck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stancavage eventually lofted a ball to deep right field for the first out but Sklenka and pinch-runner Sierra Messier (three runs) scored on the play as the sacrifice fly made it 5-1 in favor of Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Desiree Nickerson (2-for-4, two runs, RBI) followed up with a single to left, scoring Torreso from second, as Central sized up a 7-1 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Desiree did a great job out there, got her some innings,” said Hayes of Nickerson. “She’s fantastic. She’s learning every single day. I thought she did a fantastic job out there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lily VanNostrand (double, walk, two RBI), a talented freshman, and Kaley Laird followed with walks and Sam Sklenka bunted her way on again to load things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a line drive to first by Leah Sklenka, as Central had batted around, ended the third but the home team was up by six runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Faith Emery had a one-out infield single in the fourth, stole second but nothing came of it while Plainville turned to Tess Couture in the circle to start the bottom of the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto walked to open the frame and with two gone, Nickerson reached base via an error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then VanNostrand unleashed the loudest hit of the day as she slammed a ball to the fence in center to clear the bases as her double made it a 9-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, reserve Tori Hogan flipped a single into right as the RBI tally propelled the Rams to a 10-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think the freshmen have really showed their place on this team,” said Sciarretto. “Throughout all the grades, they’ve really showed how they can help the team. I thought it was really great.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Marissa Miller dropped in a one-out double in the fifth but Sciarretto zipped up a couple strikeouts to stave off the offense as the nine-run deficit loomed on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the bottom of the fifth, Central made things academic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sklenka walked to start the inning and later scored on a passed ball and Leah Sklenka, who singled to get on base, scooted home on a wild pitch to make it a 12-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the event, Stancavage drew a base-on-balls and when Nickerson absolutely kicked a ball to the outfield for a stand-up triple, pinch runner Emma Kulak tagged the dish to finish things via the mercy-rule as Central nabbed a big 13-1 victory to move to a perfect 4-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up next will be a stern challenge against Pomperaug on the road (Friday, 1:45 p.m.) in a big time non-conference clash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re just going to have to bring our A-game like we do every day,” said Hayes of the Pomperaug challenge. “[Torreso] will probably be back on the mound Friday and we’ll give it our best shot.”</p>
