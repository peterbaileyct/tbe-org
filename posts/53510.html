<p>Two Bristol high school students, both too young to vote, have been prompted by lessons at their schools to follow and engage in this year's presidential election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We worked with the electoral maps on the website, <a href="https://www.270towin.com/">270towin</a>, to make our own charts with red/Blue and swing states," said Meghan Southey, 16-year-old Bristol Central high student about an exercise in her AP Government class. "We used the charts to make our own predictions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She predicted that Kamala Harris would win by 2 percentage points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sydney Braccia, 17, a student at Bristol Eastern, said her civics class watched several years of past presidential debates and compared negative and positive points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"How the candidates treated each other, as well as their policies and if they had followed through with their promises after winning," Braccia said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comparing past debates to this year's Harris-Trump debate Braccia said, "It was less formal, and candidates showed less respect to each other.&nbsp;There was a surprising difference from past debates.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two were enjoying their flavored drinks at Starbucks mid-day on Tuesday, when they answered questions about this year's election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southey predicated that the election would come down to Pennsylvania.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I know more about how the government and electoral college works now," Southey said. "I feel like I know how to be a more informed voter, and I am excited to vote when I turn 18."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braccia said her civics class help put the voting process in perspective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I gained understanding and appreciation for the importance of voting and being informed as part of that decision,“ she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to civics, Braccia also takes a journalism class, which, she said, “helped me gain experience understanding biased and unbiased reporting in the media and news channels.”</p>
