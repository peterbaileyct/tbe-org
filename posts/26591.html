<p>BRISTOL - Back on May 8, the Southington softball team hung a 3-0 loss on Bristol Central in a huge CCC interdivisional bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights, now a perfect 20-0, scored their runs when one ball was lost in the sun - resulting in a pair of runners tagging the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other tally came from a wild pitch, leading to that 3-0 setback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be the only time Central (19-1) would see Southington during regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But would the Rams want a rematch against the Knights if the possibility came about before the CIAC class championships commences?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps in the Central Connecticut Conference Tournament?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Absolutely…absolutely,” said Central coach Monica Hayes about wanting to see Southington one more time after the team’s lone loss of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that rematch would only come in the finals of the CCC’s on Thursday, May 25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top two programs in the 2023 CCC Tournament comes down to Southington (No. 1) and Bristol Central (No. 2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the state rankings, the Knights are the top-rated squad in all of Connecticut while the Rams have been hanging around in fifth place for most of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the two featured squads make it all the way to the CCC finals, it would result in another classic confrontation from the circle, pitting Southington pitching stud Stella Blanchard against Central starlet Sophia Torreso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in case you didn’t know, Torreso is already a star and is ready for the challenge against Blanchard one more time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a matchup every scholastic sports guru would pay big bucks to witness between future NCAA Division I throwers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These kids wouldn’t be competitors if we didn’t want to” play Southington again said Hayes. “What I’ve been preaching this whole year is that these kids are competitors.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to get to the CCC Finals, two teams must be dealt with and defeated by both Central and Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the quarterfinal round on Tuesday, Central gets a rematch against Plainville from the softball field at BCHS at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the only time the two squads squared off this season, back on April 12, the Rams roasted the Blue Devils over a 13-1 romp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will the rematch be like on Tuesday between the two CCC South programs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How would Plainville deal with the likes of senior Lorelei Stancavage, catching behind the plate, not making any mistakes?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Torreso dealing, how many strikeouts is the All-Stater going to tally?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And can the Blue Devils match the offense, defense, and the many cheers senior Kaley Laird will unleash on Tuesday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are only questions Plainville can answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams advance, the squad would play the winner of No. 3 Windsor and No. 6 Edwin O. Smith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington battles No. 8 Maloney in first round action and the victor sees the winner of No. 4 Newington versus No. 5 Tolland on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all the higher seeds advance, it will be Southington/Central for all the CCC marbles on Thursday in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The odds are, yes, we should see each other again, barring any upsets, not saying it can’t happen” said Hayes of the possibility of Central/Southington part two. “We would love to see them again because that was a great softball game [between the two schools]. I’d rather play a game like that than beat somebody 15-0.”</p>
