<p>The Indian Rock Nature Preserve will host their fifth annual "Music on the Farm" concert Sunday. The event will feature live musical acts, food trucks, craft beer and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The music event will try to promote the farm animals and some of the money will go towards their food and veterinary expenses," said volunteer Laurie Fortin.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>" At Indian Rock, we have a cow named Jade, seven sheep, five turkeys, and a pig. We also have about 40 chickens, and we sell their eggs at the [Barnes] Nature Center on Shrub Road,” she added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Music on the Farm" will be held from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., with gates opening at 12:30 p.m. The concert will take place at the teaching farm of the 280-acre preserve. In the event of rain, the event will be held under a large tent on the patio.</p>

<p>Proceeds will benefit animals living at both the Indian Rock Nature Preserve and Barnes Nature Center, according to Fortin.</p>

<p>Fortin said that money raised from this event will also help support taking care of the farm, keeping the facilities up to date, and paying for programs. The preserve hosts field trips, scout troops and a popular summer camp.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
