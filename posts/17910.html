<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern and New Britain boys soccer programs posted a combined seven goals over a very competitive CCC interdivisional bout on Monday night in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;in the end, the Golden Hurricanes ended up scoring the victory over the shootout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain was able to scoop up a 4-3 win from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters fell to 3-4-1 while the Golden Hurricanes, after starting the campaign at 0-4, improved to 2-5 – winning two of their last three bouts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain’s Jesus Vega notched half of his squad’s goals to stave off pesky Eastern.<br>The Hurricanes zipped up the first two goals in the first half to grab and keep the lead throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Omar Alwishah scored halfway through the first-forty while Vega also added a late goal to give the visitors a quick 2-0 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters&nbsp;halved the score soon after as Rocco Barbino headed in a Justin Sanchez corner kick&nbsp;with&nbsp;9:24 left in the first to get back into the game at 2-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern could never get over the hump to square up the showdown.<br>New Britain scored early in the second half as Vega&nbsp;tapped home a score with 33:33 to play to make it a 3-1 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers answered when Connor Policarpio trimmed the deficit to one again as<br>he converted a Cody Greger cross with 21:01 remaining – making it 3-2 as Eastern was hanging around.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with&nbsp;14:20 to play, the visiting aggression zipped up the game-winning goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain’s Steve Guerrero converted a failed Lancer clearance that made it a 4-2 tilt.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern&nbsp;pressed and got it to 4-3 with 5:10 on the clock when Eddie Ansah put home a Ty Borry<br>pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers couldn’t get one more goal to fall in as New Britain came away with an impressive one-goal victory in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our defenders made some poor choices, and our shooters were off the&nbsp;mark," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "Credit New Britain for a quick attack&nbsp;and some great saves from their goalie Max Szczepanik.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Szczepanik tallied 14&nbsp;saves while Eastern keepers&nbsp;Peyton Cummings (four saves) and<br>Carlos Portillo combined to stop five shots.<br>After a bit of a break, it will soon be city series time for the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern hosts Bristol Central on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. from Alumni Field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, winners of three straight, hope to beat Platt on Wednesday to bring some serious momentum into the BC/BE showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be a single game challenge as the BC/BE girls tangle on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time for the girls contest is at 6:15 p.m.</p>
