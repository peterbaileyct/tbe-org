<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central wrestling team got to work on Wednesday night, squaring off against tough Avon in a CCC interdivisional bout from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams battled throughout but the Falcons were able to hang on, scooping up a 45-27 victory in Central’s debut match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bout was a rematch from last season’s Avon Duals when Central hung on to win, 40-39.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had some success up and down the card and gave Avon fits during points of the meet on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 126 pounds, Bristol’s Alex Lamarre battled Avon’s David Jacobs into second period action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, Lamarre grabbed the pinfall victory in 3:49.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following suit at 132, Central’s Joseph Nick rolled up Noli Lumani for an 8-2 victory via decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Derek Sedlak (144 pounds) needed just 1:57 to earn the pin over the Falcons’ Aaron Svelan and Aiden Lamarre (150) pinned Avon’s Carter Davies in 1:43.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 157 pound bout was dominated by Central’s Lincoln Archibald as he dropped Myles Paquette in 1:25 as the junior is poised to have another big campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others that saw action on the mats from Central included Maleeah Rios (106 pounds), Kaden Dragon (120), Julian Colon (138), Alexander Zolla (165), Jayden Colon (175), Rocco Paolino (190), Jack Jones (215) and Muhammad Khan (heavyweight).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had a very good 2022-23 campaign, going 10-3 overall and will look to replicate some of that success this season.</p>
