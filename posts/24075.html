<p>Bristol City Councilor Jolene Lusitani (R, District 1) announced her resignation Tuesday evening during the monthly city council meeting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As of March 31st, I will be resigning from City Council,” said Lusitani. “I am very honored to have this amazing opportunity with my fellow councilmen and mayor. It was such a wonderful, humble and educational experience, and I have met so many great people that live and the town of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have formed wonderful relationships, and I'm looking forward to continuing them,” Lusitani added. “Bristol is a big small town that has a community that rises up to every occasion, and I couldn't be prouder. So, a big thank you to everyone, and I know whoever fills this seat will have the same wonderful experience as I did.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
