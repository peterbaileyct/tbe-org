<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew with some brand-new Pokémon Go news for you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The World of Wonders event has taken off, and this week, it’s about the Paldean Showcase!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In case if you hadn’t noticed, Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly, are spawning more frequently as we gear up for the next fun-filled week catching Pokémon and getting into raids. Make sure you look carefully; if you win these showcases, (which are located at various Poké Stops across town,) you could get premium rewards which are challenging to come by! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The events, like many events, start at 10 a.m. For this event, it started on Wednesday, March 6, ends on Friday, March 8, at 8 p.m. Listed below are places the showcases will take place:</p>

<p>33 Queen St. (The Bristol Green)<br>651 King St. (Page Park)<br>238 Jacobs St. (Rockwell Park)</p>

<p>Another tip for trainers catching Pokémon, Ditto has now changed its disguise yet again! Here are some known encounters to catch this Kanto favorite, and it also can show up as a shiny Pokémon:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oddish Koffing Rhyhorn Goldeen Spinarak Numel Bidoof Gothita Solosis Bergmite Stufful</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many Special Research (tasks the game assigns you to do while you play) require this Pocket Monster to be caught to complete your tasks. This Pokémon can be very useful in the upcoming raids battles because it has an attack known as Transform. It copies the Pokémon you are battling against, along with its moves and stats! Try looking into various parks this weekend and use items like Incense to lure more Pokémon out this weekend.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
