<p>The annual Bristol Twilight Interleague exhibition game will feature the Bristol Shock of the Connecticut Twilight League, formerly the Bristol Knights/Southington Aftershock, and the Bristol Greeners of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League on Friday night at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game will honor Bristol Police officers and benefit the families of those officers killed in the line of duty last October. Donations can be made at the entry to Muzzy Field on Friday night, or anytime on the Fund the First website link: <a href="https://fundthefirst.com/campaign/sergeant-dustin-demonte-and-officer-alex-hamzy-r4fq06">https://fundthefirst.com/campaign/sergeant-dustin-demonte-and-officer-alex-hamzy-r4fq06</a></p>

<p>This initiative is spearheaded by the coaching staff of both the Greeners and Shock, and especially Bristol coach/player Justin Martella, who is a Wolcott police officer and lives with his family here in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martella's worked with Lt. Robert C. Osborne of the Bristol Police Dept. to make the event possible.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After 20 seasons as the Bristol Knights in the CTL, they are now known as the Bristol Shock after a mid- season merger with the Southington Aftershock. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Shock are composed of many longtime local Bristol area baseball guys, some current college players, and many former college players. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Shock are led by a strong core of player coaches who’ve been playing together for many years and happy to be back together on the field. In honor of the fallen officers, the Bristol Shock are wearing a new logo on their uniforms. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners head into their third year in the Greater Hartford Twilight League, looking to improve in league play this year after adding a number of new players in their second year under manager Trevor Mays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their roster is comprised of a combination of former high school standouts and current/former college players, primarily from Bristol as well as across the state and New England. This will also be their third annual meeting with the Connecticut Twilight League’s Bristol club.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
