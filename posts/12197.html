<p>This past winter campaign, it was impossible to ignore what the Bristol Swimming and Diving Coop accomplished in the pool as the program had several primetime performers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one of the leaders of the team was senior Mike Palaj, an All-State boys swimming standout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was tremendous over several events and as the season wore on, Palaj was heading for a big postseason finish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the entire squad had a powerful impact once the regular season was complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol contingent was undefeated over the first part of its schedule, smashing teams like Avon (96-89), Edwin O. Smith (96-90) and Plainville (95-53) along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That solid regular season carried over into the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South meet took place on March 4 and the Bristol outfit nabbed a second-place finish in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was the runner-up at the event, just swimming past a very good group from Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were 27 personal bests for Bristol, about half-a-dozen first place tallies, three new records established by the team and more than a couple CCC meet records fell by the wayside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Palaj was front and center at the league swimming showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He set a team and meet record in the 200 IM, won the 500 free - setting another team record - and was part of the 400 free relay, establishing both league and team records.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Palaj hit the pool in the Class LL Championships on March 16 from Cornerstone in West Hartford, and it was more than the same for the senior leader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 50-yard freestyle (21 seconds) and then in the 100-butterfly, he took another victory - ending the race in 50.29 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to conclude the season at the State Open event, Palaj was the champion in the 50 free, squaring away a time of 21.13 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he wasn’t finished as he did well in the 100-butterfly, placing third overall with a stellar time of 50.06 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When his season finally came to an end, Palaj established a half-dozen new team records - including five on an individual front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was there left for Palaj to do at the scholastic level?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not really and after graduation this summer, he already has his collegiate path set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s heading to Iona and will swim for the program in New Rochelle, New York.&nbsp;</p>
