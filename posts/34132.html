<p>Lois Ann Howard, 82, of Farmington, passed away on Wednesday, Sept. 13, after a long illness. She spent her last days in Southington surrounded by her loving family. She was born on April 5, 1941, in Bristol, daughter of the late Nicholas and Irene (Fradette) Carucci. Lois was the loving wife of the late Peter Howard who passed away in 2011.</p>

<p>While Lois was an ER and Psychiatric nurse for many decades, and dabbled in real estate in her later years, she was happiest when she was with family in all its forms. She grew up within walking distance of her aunts, uncles, and countless cousins. She always loved to hear of people’s lives, and loved to laugh so hard that she could barely speak. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She and her friends shared lifetimes of walks, lunches, endless conversations, laughs, and tears. Loyal to each other for decades, they formed part of the foundation of her life. Lois discovered a gift of painting later in life. It is in the stunning details and colors that we see her truest self -- her sense of wonder at the natural world around us, and the love that flowed from her heart.</p>

<p>Lois is survived by her beloved family including: son Peter Howard and his wife Elizabeth of Southington; daughter Karen Howard and her partner Christian Gaylord of Minneapolis, Minn.; precious grandchildren Jessica Rana and her husband Ali of North Haven, Matthew Howard of Southington; sisters Patricia Giomblanco of Mystic, Jean Porter of Plainville, her nieces, nephews, godchildren, and dear friends, some from as far back as kindergarten days.</p>

<p>She also leaves Johnnie, Ryan, Erinlyn, Sean, and Aidan Rowland who all lovingly called her Grandma Lois, along with their parents John and Jennifer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The family would like to especially thank her longtime friend, Donna Friday, for her unwavering friendship and love for Lois. They also thank the brilliant Dr. Molly Brewer and her dedicated oncology team at UConn Health Center for their genuine care and commitment to Lois’ health and quality of life.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
