<p>BURLINGTON - After a standout playing career for the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team, Xavier Wade has transitioned himself into a pretty good coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you know anything about the likable Wade, that doesn’t come as much surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade, a tremendous leader when he took the court at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium, was a commanding presence on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the boys team at Lewis Mills had an opening for a coach, the leader of the program went right after Wade - bringing him into the fold as another Bristol connection is helping round out the Spartans’ program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Xavier’s been a great addition,” said Lewis Mills coach Ryan Raponey.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade was a standout point guard at Eastern and played extremely well during his freshmen campaign at Mount Ada.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After playing collegiately, he’s been involved in coaching hoops, mostly recently in a travel capacity in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Raponey, with ties to Plainville, knew Wade’s resume and scooping him up as an assistant at Mills was probably the biggest no-brainer decision the head coach has ever made.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was looking to get into the high school ranks,” said Raponey of Wade. “He had been coaching some AAU, some travel ball in other towns right next door. I heard that and we had a position open up. He was one of the first guys I contacted when the job opened up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I asked if he was interested and he said he was.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lewis Mills program has a lot of experienced voices on the bench and Wade has added his to the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade has proven to be an excellent teacher, getting the younger kids up to speed and is another respected coach every player can turn to.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He brings a very good energy to the game, good energy to the gym with the younger kids and he’s a really good guy to have on the bench working with your varsity guys,” said Raponey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a player for the Lancers, Wade bought a cool, calm demeanor to the Eastern program under then head coach Mike Giovinazzo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a high IQ player and with some athletes around him, leading the program all the way to the Class L semifinals as a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That year, Eastern went 20-4 overall, tying the school record for victories in a season, and Wade was just a step away from getting the program to the finals for just the second time in school history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade played in 71 career games for the Lancers, scoring 522 points for an average of 7.4 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a consistent presence on the varsity level over his final three years, leading Eastern to 48 victories during that span.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade is tied for 40th all-time in three-pointers made at Eastern with 25 and his biggest trifecta came at E.O. Smith in Storrs on February 19, 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a game that featured future UCONN standout Tyler Olander and the contest tied at 53-53 with 10 seconds left in regulation, Wade confidently barreled down the court, dribbling towards the three-point line and the imposing Olander.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade squared right up to Olander, unleashed the biggest 3 of his career and the senior saw the ball splash in at the buzzer - propelling the Lancers to an improbable 56-53 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started games for Mount Ada in Newton, Massachusetts as a freshmen but focused on his studies after his one season for the Mustangs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was fearless as a player but the soft-spoken coach has a voice every player should pay attention to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wade has a bright future in coaching and at Lewis Mills, he’s only beginning to scratch the surface.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was a highly skilled player in high school that won a lot,” said Raponey. “He won a lot in high school and then, he went and played at the next level.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What’s better than having a guy like that on your staff?”</p>
