<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early last week, Donovan Clingan and the UConn men’s basketball team learned a little more about its non-conference 2023-24 schedule as the defending National Champions have another loaded slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, the All-State and CIAC Division II champ from Bristol Central, will lead the charge as the season - and title defense - commences on Monday, November 6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies open up against Northern Arizona on November 6 from either Gampel Pavilion or the XL Central in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the program will split time between the venues in Storrs and Hartford this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, UConn will play its first few games at home - a slate of three games over an eight-day span.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the non-conference schedule really starts to heat up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On November 19, the Huskies travel to New York to take part of the Empire Classic from Madison Square Garden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn opens tournament play against Indiana and then the following day, the Huskies will draw either Texas or Louisville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals continue with that New York theme on November 24, hosting a showdown against Manhattan which is program former St. Paul All-Stater Carey Edwards once suited up for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On November 24, the University of New Hampshire invades the Nutmeg State but the stakes truly increase to open the month of December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 1, UConn takes part of a BIG EAST/Big 12 Battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies travel to Kansas for a huge main event challenge and after that showdown, UConn will get four days off before a trip back to New York is in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies have been invited to partake in the annual Jimmy V Classic and from MSG on December 5, it’s a date against ACC power North Carolina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 9, an unusual opponent comes to Connecticut in the form of Arkansas-Pine-Bluff and finally on December 15, UConn plays in its final non-conference game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s going to be a good one as the Huskies square off against Gonzaga, a superior regular season opponent, in an epic showdown from Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The non-conference schedule is loaded and that’s before the Huskies truly get involved with its slate of Big East Games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Stonehill to Gonzaga, the Huskies will be battling programs with several different talent levels, styles, and abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol’s center of attention</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After going 31-8 overall and adding the program’s fifth National Title, Clingan is poised to have a big season for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if he shows the growth everyone expects, due to increased playing time, the 7-foot-2 center might not be around Storrs for much longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Clingan posted nearly seven points and 5.6 rebounds-per-game in just 13.0 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nearly canned two out of every three field goals he took and easily led the program in blocks with 70 (1.8 blocks-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan will be flashing up some three-pointers this season and display more of an all-around game NBA scouts will be interested in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one thing at a time as the Huskies hit the court for its first official game just over two months away with Clingan and company itching to defend its 2022-23 championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>At the Rent</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan and his teammates were on hand for UConn’s football game on Friday night, displaying a certain National Championship trophy to the delight of 36,000 adoring fans (rumor has it that Donovan held the championship trophy the entire evening…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan was also cheering on former Bristol Central basketball teammate Victor Rosa as he scored two touchdowns and nearly rushed for 100 yards in the Huskies 24-14 setback to N.C. State.</p>
