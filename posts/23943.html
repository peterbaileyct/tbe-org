<h3>Weather</h3>

<p>Eighty percent chance of rain and snow or snow and rain. Or, just snow or just rain. Confused? Yup, us too, or we too, if you prefer. Tuesday, things are a mess. </p>

<h3>St. Paul hoops circa 1975</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this date in 1975, before a crowd of 2,883 at the New Haven Coliseum, the St. Paul men’s basketball team rolled to a 62-33 win over Woodrow Wilson of Middletown in the Class B Semi-Finals.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top-seeded Falcons dominated throughout, Mark Noon led the way on offense with 22, while John Majewski and Frank Owsianko scored in double figures, too, with 18 and 10, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On defense, 6’4" Sean Moore played solid defense against Woodrow Wilson’s top player, 6’8' Darryl Barnes, who scored 14 and was in foul trouble early.</p>

<h3>The return of Don 'The Hawk' Hawkins</h3>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Q; What do you give a sick lemon?<br><em>A Lemon-aid.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you think we felt? &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
