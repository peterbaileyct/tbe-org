<p>In the early 1960s, David Crosby was working as a folk singer on the coffee-house circuit when he met fellow musicians Jim (Roger) McGuinn and Gene Clark. The trio of guitarists added Michael Clarke on drums and Chris Hillman on bass to form The Byrds. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarded as one of the most influential acts of folk-rock, The Byrds released their first single <em>Mr. Tambourine Man</em> in April 1965. The song was a smash hit, rocketing to No. 1 on both the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the U.K. Singles Chart. Their debut album of the same name is one of five Byrds albums to be named on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>

<p>Crosby recorded five albums with the Byrds before departing the band in October of 1967.  The guitarist reunited with the original Byrds lineup in October 1972 to record their reunion album <em>Byrds</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1968, Crosby connected with two veteran musicians from other influential bands: Stephen Stills of Buffalo Springfield and Graham Nash of The Hollies. The trio recorded their self-titled debut album the following year, which was met with immediate success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crosby, Stills, and Nash (CSN) had only performed for a live audience once before playing to 500,000 people at Woodstock on Aug. 18, 1969. The band took the stage at 3:30 a.m. alongside Stills’ former bandmate Neil Young, to perform anthems of the ‘60s counterculture, including “Guinnevere,” “Marrakesh Express” and “Mr. Soul.”</p>

<p>Crosby’s iconic musical career as a singer, songwriter and guitarist spanned seven decades. His influential work earned Crosby two Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame inductions: the first with The Byrds in 1991 and the second in 1997 with CSN. Following his death on Jan. 18, 2023, musicians around the world paid tribute to the cultural icon. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.
