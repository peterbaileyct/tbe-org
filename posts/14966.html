<p>“We had a great event last year; three bands played at Wood Acres Farm. This year we have five bands at the Terryville Fairgrounds, and it’s going to be a blast.”</p>

<p>Jeff Suma and the Roasters will be returning to volunteer their psychedelic sound for the benefit. The six-piece ensemble perform their original songs like “Long, Slow Roast,” as well as classic rock covers. LB4 incorporate funk, reggae, blues, rock, and soul into their original songs&nbsp;like “Haven’t I Seen You” and covers alike. The Remnants bring a modern Americana sound to covers and originals like their song “Light.”</p>

<p>Blondie &amp; Beyond will hit the stage paying tribute to female-fronted rock of the ‘70s and ‘80s like Blondie’s “Heart of Glass.” Country Steel will bring a modern country sound with songs like the Marshall Tucker Band’s “Can’t You See.” Katrina and Mark will also be providing their talents on stage with an acoustic set, and a raffle will take place at 8 p.m.</p>

<p>Brian’s Angels was founded by Pat Stebbins in memory of her son Brian Pinz who died in 1998 after having a period of homelessness. The organization started in August 2015 with volunteers passing out water on hot days in downtown Bristol and has grown tremendously over the past 7 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stebbins said that the proceeds from the benefit will likely be put towards a move to a larger location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We need a bigger space. During the pandemic, we were taking care of 20-21 people a day, and we’re taking care of anywhere between 30 – 50 people right now. The numbers have gone up significantly since they allowed the evictions to start.” The Connecticut and federal eviction moratoriums expired last summer.</p>

<p>Advance tickets can be purchased online for $20 on the Eventbrite website, and tickets will be available at the door for $25. Foods and beer trucks will be parked onsite, and non-alcohol drinks will also be available to purchase. Guests are welcome to bring shade tents, blankets, and lawn chairs; however, animals and coolers will not be allowed at the event.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will also be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
