<p>I thought that I'd comment on the late Bristol Police Sgt. Alex A. Hamzy, who was killed on Oct. 22, 2022, after responding to a residence with an uncontrollable armed man inside. Alex was shot and killed along with Lt. Dustin Demonte, with a third officer, Alec Iurato, being seriously wounded.</p>

<p>My reason for this segment is to recall Alex, whom I crossed paths with on many occasions, those prior to his service with the police department. Alex worked part-time in high school at the Crystal luncheonette/diner owned and operated by his parents, Ahman and Salma. Alex worked weekends as the "Toast Master." His job was to prepare the toast for the many breakfast and dinner meals, all the while smiling and talking to customers when he could.</p>

<p>I recall sitting with him at the library one day when we talked about what he was going to do with his future. This conversation took place just before he graduated from Bristol Eastern. I always felt he would do well in this world with that smile of his and solid work ethic. He was a charmer without trying to be. God bless Alex Hamzy!</p>

<p>Andre Johnson, Jr. of Bristol, played two minutes last Saturday when the No. 1 UConn men's basketball team topped Xavier in Hartford by a score of 99-56. When you can count Maryellen Holden as a friend, that means you've done something right in your life. I received an email from MeH, as I have referred to her at times, and she is wishing me the best with this column effort. MeH signed off of her email with "Best, best, best. Maryellen."</p>

<p>This one's for the old-timers, those even older than this writer -- Wasn't the late John Reardon, facility director at Bristol High, a special guy! </p>

<p>At a military program at the Manross Branch Library, I once mentioned the U.S. Army, Marines, Navy and Air Force as the branches of our military. I forgot to mention the U.S. Coast Guard and was embarrassingly reminded in front of the audience of the omission. My friend Dave Corey was a Coast Guard man. My bad. So, I say thank you to all of these men and women who are actually part of Homeland Security as a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces which includes the other four branches. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I received a thoughtful email from Jay Messier, who lives with his family around the corner and down the street from where I am. Jay walks the family dog around our block, but not so recently because of the weather. The times he does, we always exchange "hellos" when I'm in the front yard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay is the son of Pam and the late Ron Messier. They, too, have stopped by when I was outside on the front porch, Pam and Ron were always the happiest couple.</p>

<p><strong>My cancer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, I don't like to write about myself, and have tried to avoid it. In past years, I've had stories written about me pertaining to recognitions I've received, those written by others. But, I feel I should talk about my past year of health issues, because everyone and their brother asks me how I'm doing when they see or call me by phone. I've been battling cancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, it's been prostate cancer three times starting around 2008, but it is being controlled right now. I had a heart valve repair five years ago and only then found out my brother, Bill, and mom, Ruth, both had valve replacements. Starting last year around March, I received radiation for melanoma in my nose. Six weeks of five days per week was my regimen. That was wearing a special mask to keep the radiation off of my handsome face (heh, heh). That cancer has since gone away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a break of some weeks in completing the radiation, I had an MRI to see where I was at. It turned out that they found cancer in the lymph nodes in my neck. An operation on that problem went well. However, a PET scan following this showed that I had cancer spread to other parts of my body. Monthly immunology followed and two weeks ago a PET scan showed there was no more cancer. I'll continue this monthly therapy until May. I'm back! </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
