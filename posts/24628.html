<p>BRISTOL – What exactly is going to be the encore for Bristol Central’s softball team after last season’s dash to the Class LL finals?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another championship date in June?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams already are off and running, squaring up a 14-2 victory over Newington on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The beat simply continues behind the some of the state’s best pitching in the form of Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there isn’t another team in the state that boasts that kind of talent and skill in the circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throw in a little defense, hitting and leadership from Kaley Laird, along with Sam and Leah Sklenka in the outfield and this unit could be a very special team come the final month of play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to look for from the 2022 Class LL runners-up this season:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL SOFTBALL&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Monica Hayes (9th season. In eight seasons, Hayes is 93-60 overall).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 season</strong>: 22-5 overall. Ranked No.&nbsp;5&nbsp;in the Class LL playoffs, Central went all the way to the championship game, falling to Southington 13-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Losses</strong>:&nbsp;Gabby Buonafede (INF), Ryleigh Hall (OF), Sarah Romano (INF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players</strong><strong>&nbsp;to Watch</strong>: Sophia Torreso (sr, P/1B), Alex Sciarretto (sr, P/3B), Lorelei Stancavage (sr, C), Kaley Laird (sr, INF), Sam Sklenka (sr, OF), Leah Sklenka (jr, OF), Mya Porrini (so, INF), Adrianna Lubrico (sr, INF), Sierra Messier (jr), Lily VanNostrand (fr, OF), Tori Hogan (fr, IF), Abby Simard (jr), Jaznell Rosado (jr), Emma Kulak (fr, IF), Bella Guarda (fr, IF).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2023 Season Outlook</strong>: The Rams are going to smother opponents with defense and then hit the ball all over the park on the flip side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that kind of attack is going to deflate the opposition early and often in Central Connecticut Conference competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the expectations for this squad come from practice to practice and game by game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The expectations we’ve set for ourselves, as a program, are to compete every day,” said Hayes. “They compete for playing time in practice, compete in drills in practice and compete in games, regardless of opponent. Those expectations are the same every year and have not changed!&nbsp; To make such an outcome-based goal, such as championship or bust, is unrealistic. If we compete in everything we do, we will find ourselves pleased with our efforts at the end of the season.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s easy to have high hopes for the squad with that senior pitching duo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso (12-3 in 2022, 0.90 ERA, 183 Ks) was Class LL All-State last year and the future George Washington standout is hungry for more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same goes for Sciarretto (10-2, 0.97 ERA, 127 Ks) and is interchangeable with Torreso.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto, heading off to Stonehill next season, doesn’t back down from anyone and wants to get back to the championship game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just last season, the duo combined for 22 victories and expect more of the same in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sophia and Alex are two of the most effective in the state and we are grateful to have them,” said Hayes. “These two have competed for their positions every day for the last couple years and have both seen incredible progress. We will continue to utilize them both in the circle, and benefit from their experience and leadership as seniors.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catching for the All-State duo is Lorelei Stancavage, one of the unsung heroes of the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She quietly goes about her business behind the plate and helps those two checkers immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she never lets any stray ball get away from the dish as Stancavage is one of the many heartbeats of the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battery leadership is impressive considering the varsity innings Torreso, Sciarretto and Stancavage have put together as a unit for Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She is incredibly consistent, and we value Lorelei’s ability to catch both Alex and Sophia, daily,” said Hayes. “It’s a great experience for her to say she’s caught two pitchers of their caliber and will only make Lorelei more valuable at the next level.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of leadership, and ability, senior Kaley Laird (second base, shortstop) comes back to the fold, bringing defense and her bat at the top of the lineup and the Sklenka’s – Sam and Leah – will lead the crew in the outfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experienced duo also has good sticks to match and should help create energy in the field and at the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Mya Porrini and senior Adrianna Lubrico will see some time in the infield while junior Sierra Messier could earn playing time according to Hayes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the veteran coach could also turn to a couple freshman for support along with a familiar face who rejoined the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Lily VanNostrand (outfield) and Tori Hogan (infield) are in the mix while Abby Simard returns to the squad for her junior campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaznell Rosado, Emma Kulak (infield) and Bella Guarda (infield) will also contribute to the cause when called upon as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is primed for another deep playoff run and will accomplish that goal with a mix of those veteran players and newcomers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch:&nbsp;</strong>Central’s regular season schedule is stacked once again as the program will be ultra prepared for the postseason.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already 1-0 after a 14-2 demolition of Newington on Monday, Central battles non-conference standout Pomperaug on Friday, April 14, while the following Monday, a test at Hall is in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the month of April, the Rams squares off against Glastonbury (April 27), travel to both Bristol Eastern (May 1) and Berlin (May 3) before returning home for aClass LL title game grudge match against Southington (May 8, 4:45 p.m.) in a huge attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a unique back-to-back on May 12-13 that has Central battling Berlin at home and then Waterford on the road and to complete the regular season, the Rams welcome the Lancers on May 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, there’s no easy out on the slate for Central but the program is looking to get better by the game and prepare for another lengthy postseason jaunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In order to win tournament games, we need to continuously challenge this team in the regular season,” said Hayes. “I look forward to how we respond to those challenges. That’s what makes competing fun and provides kids with great opportunities for success!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
