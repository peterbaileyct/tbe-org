<p>Plans for this year's Rockwell Festival are coming along, according to the West End Association vice president.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We still have three weeks to go and have a large number of our vendors already signed up with several still pending," said Jesse Jablon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year the annual festival drew a record 180 spaces, allowing for double spaces, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This year, we already have 112 vendors officially signed," he added, "plus another 60 or so pending so we should be right about where we were last year."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said there are over 35 booths that are first-time vendors this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We have our mix of civic organizations, nonprofits, crafters, retailers, 14 food booths, the Kids Zone, Art District, car show and pie eating contest," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The festival is also expanding is school supply give-away program. Details are still being worked out, he said, but two new sponsors have come on board -- Price Chopper and Liberty Bank.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
