<p>The Bristol Blues are bringing a special guest to Muzzy Field on Thanksgiving Day; one whose arrival has been highly anticipated by fans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are unveiling our new mascot during the Battle of the Bell,” said Sarah Lucian. “He just arrived today all the way from England.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucian is the Bristol Blues Director of Community Partnerships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m so excited for this,” said Perchiano. “We’re going to have so much fun next season.”</p>

<p>The large brown package from across the pond was ceremoniously unboxed during a celebration that included festive blue cupcakes. Among those present were Blues intern Julia Simpson and employee/ultra-fan Jamie Perchiano.</p>

<p>While the 2022 NECBL Western Division champs are excited about the newest member of their team, you won’t find his name on the roster just yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He doesn’t have a name right now,” said Lucian. We’re going to have a survey on Facebook for the fans to choose his name.”</p>

<p> “We can’t wait for the community to meet our new mascot,” said Lucian. “We’re counting down the days.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues, who finished their 2022 season 32-12, tied with the Vermont Mountaineers for the best record in the league. While fans will have to wait another seven months to see action on the diamond, the mascot reveal is just two weeks away.  </p>
