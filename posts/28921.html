<p>The whirlwind tour for the University of Connecticut men’s basketball championship squad has taken the program just about everywhere since winning its fifth NCAA title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies have gone to the White House, honored by the President, and recently, most of the program took Fenway Park by storm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant former Bristol Central standout Donovan Clingan was in the house when the Red Sox took on the New York Mets on Friday evening in Boston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad was honored before the game as the Red Sox bought the team a little dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later that evening, Clingan - along with teammate Tristen Newton - helped throw out the first pitch against the Mets.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, Clingan was on the freshman baseball team at BCHS, and the then 6-foot-10 athlete was a big deal on the diamond (literally).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now at 7-feet-2, he was also a big presence on the mound at Fenway and ended up chucking in a strike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn head coach Dan Hurley has certainly enjoyed the spoils of winning the NCAA title and going to places like Fenway is a huge deal for him and the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan had an amazing first year for the UConn team after leading Bristol Central to a 28-0 record as a senior and a CIAC Division II title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After winning it all scholastically in 2021-22, Clingan turned around and performed the same feat collegiately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played in all 39 games for the Huskies last year, getting 13.0 minutes-per-game - sharing the center position with future Chicago Bulls reserve Adama Sanago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan averaged nearly 7.0 points and 5.6 rebounds-per-game to go along with a team-leading 70 blocks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect those numbers to increase by two or three times as Clingan will become the man in the middle for the program this coming year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect to see him drop in a three-pointer or two along the way as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the NBA on his mind, a possible top-10 selection is possible by the end of his sophomore year, and the sky is the limit for the tremendous center via Bristol Central from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the right, local professional team can acquire his services, perhaps one day, he’ll be throwing out another pitch in the near future from Fenway Park (maybe the Boston Celtics?!?).</p>
