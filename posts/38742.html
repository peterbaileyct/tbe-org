<p>Recently, the Connecticut High School Coaches Association released its All-State football teams for 2023, dividing the classes into specific teams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each squad was voted on by the CHSCA coaches and, to the surprise of no one locally, a certain bulldog from the program at Bristol Eastern made the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the no-brainer decision of the year, Eastern senior Adam Zavecz earned a spot on the Class M/MM CHSCA All-State Defensive Team at the linebacker position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz was nothing less than sensational this past season, a defensive standout from the start of the campaign to its completion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the impact that Zavecz left on the football squad might not be measurable in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz and the senior class, more important than stats, wins or losses, left the program in a better spot than when they found it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the ultimate complement for a tremendous competitor like Zavecz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up leading the program in defensive touchdowns with two, turning around and intercepting a couple Farmington passes and running them back to the house for touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz was the team leader in total tackles and dished out enough punishment and misery on the field - leaving opponents dazed and confused most nights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot, 195 tight end and linebacker was second on the team in tackles for losses (9.5) and yardage lost (19.5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz always seemed to be in on every play and when he got a hold of an opponent, that athlete was sent crashing to the turf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was everywhere on the field for the Lancers over the past two seasons and the senior truly excelled this year on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz’s defense kept opponents from scoring in the red zone as opponents only cashed in on 9-of-17 attempts once getting within Eastern’s 20 yard-line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, the Lancers gave up just 101 points, the seventh fewest in program history, while the three shutouts on the road were a team record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The award was certainly a deserving one for Zavecz, an excellent student-athlete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
