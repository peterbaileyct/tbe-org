<p>Bristol officials recently improved traffic safety in the Mt. View neighborhood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neon yellow plaques marked "Traffic from left (or right)" were added to the traffic Stop signs at the three-way intersection of Kozani Street, Vera Road and O’Sullivan Drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While O’Sullivan and Kozani have stop signs, traffic coming from Vera Road does not, which for those unfamiliar with the intersection has been a source of confusion. The plaques were added because drivers routinely misinterpret the intersection as an all-way stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two plaques, with a black legend and border on a yellow background, were added to the stop signs on Kozani and O’Sullivan to warn motorists that traffic oncoming from Vera does not stop.</p>

<p>Most of the problems at that intersection occur due to motorists being in a hurry and using the neighborhood as a cut-through to get to or from Camp Street.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience. People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</p>
