<p>Louise (Humphrey) Van Gorder enriched the lives of thousands of students and music lovers in Bristol through the Bristol String Orchestra and Fiddlin’ Around, a former music store in Bristol that she and her husband Bob founded. Every year, Louise and Bob would send one of their students to Laurel Music Camp for a unique weeklong camp experience. Before she passed away in 2014, Louise’s family established a fund at Main Street Community Foundation to ensure that the tradition would continue.</p>
