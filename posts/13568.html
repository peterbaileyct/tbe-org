<p>MERIDEN - Frankly, there wasn’t any doubt that the boys track and field team over at Bristol Central was coming home from the CCC South Championships on Tuesday from Platt High School in Meriden with the league title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the competition wasn’t even close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams racked up 167 points to score the CCC South title while runner-up Lewis Mills (92.5 points) was a distant second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Central track and field dominated the CCC South Championship today to finish the season 14-0,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “These boys continue the strong tradition of winning for Central track and field.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern hung in as well, scoring 74.5 points for fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two top individuals and relay teams were named to the CCC South All-Conference team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And boy, Central’s numbers piled up quickly - having athletes earn All-Conference honors up and down the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back from a jaunt to sunny Florida, Victor Rosa won both the 100 meters (11.42 seconds) and made the toss of the day in the javelin (158 feet, three inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Victor Rosa showed how elite an athlete he is with a monster javelin throw,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 400 meters, Noah Conrod won the event in 51.77 seconds while Frankie Porrini completely dominated the 800, 1600, and 3200 meter fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing ever changes as Porrini is the best distance runner the CCC South has to offer - winning all three events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini ran under two minutes in the 800 meters once again (1:58.68) while in the 1600, the junior won in 4:30.07 and then dominated in the 3200 (9:40.05).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie Porrini is a beast, winning three tough races and really demonstrating what he is made of this outdoor season,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jarrett Boxley was tremendous in the 300 hurdles, taking second place in 43.52 seconds and the 4x100 meter relay squad also did extremely well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The unit of Cassias Breland, Conrod, Logan Jackson, and Boxley placed second in 44.87 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treshawn Blair won the high (5 feet, 8 inches) and triple jump (42 feet, 8.5 inches) and then in the discus, Dan Lauretti’s toss of 135 feet, one inch won him an individual CCC South title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CCC South Championship meet was a full team effort,” said Stafford-Kirk. “My boys really stepped up and dominated overall. I'm excited to see what they can do at the State meet next week. Seniors Rosa, Dan Lauretti, Malachi Jones, Noah Conrod, Jarrett Boxley, Ashton Zabka, and Maddox Reardon brought the CCC South Championship back home to Bristol Central where it belongs!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Eastern boys, the 4x800 team of Logan Crowley, Jack Mulcunry, Dom Tartarelli, and Carter Harris won the race in 8:23.26 - earning CCC South honors in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That feat was duplicated in the 4x400 as Mulcunry, Dante Marciano, Edward Ansah, Harris won in 3:37.11 as the Lancers have shown tremendous poise all season long in those two relay events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris scored second place in the 800 meters (2:01.46), Joshua Moore did the same in the 110 hurdles (second, 17.22 seconds) and Mulcunry was All-Conference in the 400 meters with a second place finish of 52.14 seconds.</p>
