<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern boys golf team will be back in action in the coming weeks and even with the loss of a couple primetime performers from last year’s program, head coach Anthony Julius is looking forward to the campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had a successful 2021 season and return two starters from last year's roster, something for the locals to build upon as the spring months progress.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Despite the losses of Drew Fries, Tyler Donohue, and Katie Bardeck the Lancers will look to Luke Dauphinee and Noah Constantine who are both senior captains to anchor the lineup,” said Julius.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The longtime coach will also add a few newcomers to the varsity lineup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Football favorite Connor Gimpl is looking forward to swinging the clubs this season along with Alyssa Valentine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lancers open the 2022 campaign on Monday, April 18 against Maloney from Hunter Golf Club in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s followed by another bout on the road, this time battling Windsor on Thursday, April 21 from Goodwin Park Golf Course.&nbsp;</p>
