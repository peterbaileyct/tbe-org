<p>Eastern star Autumn Udoh was called for her third foul with five minutes remaining in the second period. She was forced to watch from the bench for the remainder of the first half, as an early ten point lead for the Lancers disappeared and the teams went into halftime with Eastern leading by a single point, 29-28.</p>

<p>Her counterpart from Bristol Central, Nicole Reimer, had only one foul in the opening half, but accumulated four more in the second, fouling out with two minutes remaining in the game. Her disqualification was a real blow to the Rams, as she was their leading scorer with 21 points and was forced to watch the final minute from the Rams’ bench.</p>
