<p>Harvest Bakery will remain closed through the weekend following a machine malfunction, according to a Facebook post Thursday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Unfortunately, we will still be closed through this weekend," the post reads. "As always we will keep everyone posted as we get more information."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bakery's oven malfunctioned last week. A note on the door informed customers of the malfunction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Trying to find parts and labor for some of our specialized machines is proving to be difficult," the note reads, and asks people to check the Facebook page for updates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We apologize for the last-minute inconvenience and are doing our best to get back and better than ever."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the note and the lastest Facebook announcement mention that the staff is taking the time to give the store a facelift and asks for patience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Thank you, Bristol, and its surrounding towns for our continued support, and we feel confident we are coming back better than ever," the most recent Facebook post reads.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
