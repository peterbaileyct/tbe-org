<p>Library staff, friends, volunteers and community members gathered at the Bristol Public Library on Thursday to celebrate the opening of the Library Café.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m excited,” said library director Debbie Prozzo. “It’s wonderful to see this space open thanks to the support of the Friends. We couldn’t serve beverages for three years during covid, and this is a nice new space. Patrons are returning to the library and it’s wonderful.”  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The newly unveiled café was funded by dedicated nonprofit volunteer group Friends of the Bristol Public Library through book sales and other activities throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Friends are moving out of the basement,” said Rose Ann Chatfield. “Debbie came to me six weeks ago; she said, ‘Would you be interested in doing this?’ So, we came out and thought, ‘Wow, this is a bigger space than we thought.’ It turned out very nice."</p>

<p>The first hot beverage from the café was a cup of black coffee enjoyed by Ellie Wilson, an original member of the Friends of the Bristol Public Library and longtime library employee. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> “I started as a page just out of high school, and I worked at the library for 39 years,” said Wilson. “This is a wonderful place where someone can just sit, relax, have coffee and read.” </p>

<p>“This is a really nice addition to the library,” said library assistant director Scott Stanton. “It’s a nice bright area and it’s a great use of this space. Before Covid we had a little coffee nook, but this is a much nicer area. It’s also good for the Friends to have a space upstairs for their wares.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
