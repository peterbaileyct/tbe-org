<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central football program entered the month of November the way it ended October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that is winning pigskin games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a Central Connecticut Conference Tier 3 challenge against RHAM on Friday night, Central scored the first twenty points of the contest - holding off the Raptors over a 34-20 victory to move to 7-1 overall on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was the final home game of the year for the Bristol Central seniors under the lights at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only games with Plainville and Bristol Eastern remain on the schedule for the Rams and it’s going to be difficult to slow down the surging program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of surging, Victor Rosa was up to his old tricks again, running for 304 yards and four touchdowns against RHAM and now boasts over 2,000 yards on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t a top-10 all time showing in terms of single game rushing yards for Central but Rosa continues to climb the list of all-time rushing yardage accumulated in a season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, Rosa has amassed 2,071 yards which is the fourth best single season yardage total in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s just 82 yards away from Garry Pearson’s total of 2,153 yards in 1978 for third place all-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Timmy Washington owns the top two spots with 2,711 yards in 2001 while scooping up over 3,000 yards (3,005) the previous season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a possible postseason berth in play, Rosa could be nearing one of Washington’s amazing totals by the completion of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statistic that is clearly in reach for the talented senior is the single season touchdown scoring record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After compiling four touchdowns against RHAM, Rosa has 33 for the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only Washington tallied more in a season - collecting 37 in 2001 while compiling a school record 42 back in 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Early domination against the Raptors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors trailed 20-0 midway through the second period before playing the Rams even the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over first quarter play, Rosa streaked into the end zone for TD scores of one and 33 yards to help the home squad square up a 12-0 lead through 12 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa then added a three-yard touchdown run a bit later and when Damion Glasper punched in a two-point conversion, Central’s cushion reached 20-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams led 20-6 at the half and added two third period scores to close out the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tre Blair took in a 25 yard reception from Rosa for another six points and the Rams’ ended scoring as Rosa made a 12 yard dash into the goal for a TD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Justin Despins raced in for a two-point conversion run, Central snared a 34-14 edge to salt the showdown away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where is Central at in the Class L state tournament picture?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has now won seven straight games and is in control of its postseason destiny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the playoffs ended today, Central would be ranked fifth, squaring off against Windsor (7-1) on the road, in quarterfinal action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have 1130 points this season, averaging 141.25 to Windsors’ 141.88 tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three top teams in the Class L standings includes No. 1 St. Joseph and second ranked Maloney, both 7-1, along with Naugatuck (6-1) in third place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those four programs ahead of Central have at least one epic challenge left before the completion of the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph plays against Trumbull (6-2) on November 25 - that’s Thanksgiving by the way - while Maloney tangles against Platt in a rivalry game in Meriden from Falcon Field on that same day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good luck to Naugatuck against undefeated Ansonia on November 25 while Windsor tangles with Newington (6-2) this coming weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central plays the Blue Devils this Friday in Plainville which won’t be any picnic either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A loss by Plainville could knock the squad out of playoff contention in the Class M field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means the game has big stakes for both squads involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Defense</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After allowing 98 combined points against Hartford Public and Tolland, Central’s defense has returned to its previous levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past two weeks, Edwin O. Smith and RHAM scored just 28 total points for an average of 14.0 points-per-game allowed by Central’s defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s getting the job done.&nbsp;</p>
