<p id="isPasted">The City is accepting submissions from developers and associated parties for the transfer of ownership and redevelopment of an approximately 3.54-acre property commonly known as the J.H. Sessions and Son Building at 273 Riverside Avenue, Bristol CT (the “Property”). The City intends to transition this environmentally remediated property from an abandoned mill building to a vibrant workforce housing apartment community. The Request for Proposals and other related materials are available on the City’s website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bristolct.gov/bids">http://www.bristolct.gov/bids</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Proposals will be accepted by the City of Bristol Purchasing Department until&nbsp;1:00 pm, April 16, 2024.</strong>&nbsp;Submissions received after that time will not be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Abou the Property</strong><br>&nbsp;Bristol is leading a complete revitalization of the Riverside Avenue corridor, an effort known locally as the “Riverside Revival.” Riverside Avenue runs parallel with the popular Memorial Boulevard Park and is a key gateway to the City’s reenergized downtown. The City is embarking on a State funded, complete streetscape reconstruction for Riverside Avenue while encouraging new development and business activity along the corridor. Redevelopment of the 80,000 square-foot J.H. Sessions and Son building – a handsome brick building with high ceilings, wooden floors, exposed beams, and similar desirable features – stands as the centerpiece of the “Riverside Revival.” The City, together with New Colony Development Corp. landbank and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, are providing quite literally a “clean slate” for developers to consider: the Property has been remediated to State requirements and is poised for redevelopment as soon as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
