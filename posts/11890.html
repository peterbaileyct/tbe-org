<p>NEW HAVEN – &nbsp;Chemistry is a critical ingredient in any successful scholastic sports program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have the right mix and balance, your team could be headed to very big things by the time the postseason rolls around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But along with chemistry comes consistency and those two elements go hand in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the boys basketball team over at Bristol Central have both those attributes in droves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, when you stick veterans such as Donovan Clingan, Damion Glasper, Carson Rivoira, Steve Alseph and Victor Rosa all on the same squad, what’s the ultimate result?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You get 27 games played (27 games started), 27 straight wins in 2021-22 and 42 consecutive victories overall with the same starting five players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That senior core played 135 total games between the five of them this season and the results have been of devastating proportions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You can’t underestimate the seniors,” said Central coach Tim Barrette after his squad defeated Wilton in overtime on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s not an overnight sensation as four out of those five senior players have been in the Bristol Central trenches the entire ride since they were freshmen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then this season, Alseph was added to the mix as he transferred in from Waterbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s like a chef with an award-winning dish adding a secret ingredient to the meal that puts it over the top.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Alseph has hardly been a dash of nutmeg to Bristol Central’s four-course meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Putting the slick shooting and gritty guard into the mix now makes that meal a five-course masterpiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s something else to consider about this senior group for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with fellow seniors Jelani Walton, Zach Vanasse and Aaron Brown, that grouping is responsible in scoring 1,715 of the team’s total 1,909 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means 90-percent of the program’s offense comes from that group of eight men -- all seniors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the value of having senior play, senior leadership and everything that comes along with four-year athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to come that close to scoring 2,000 points in a season is a tremendous accomplishment for any scholastic program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While people realize that Clingan is the ultimate bailout, being able to carry Central offensively for a half, the whole game doesn’t work like that for the locals as the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, that squad isn’t assembled to operate like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Clingan gets triple-teamed, he passes the ball over to Glasper (10.9 points-per-game, 34 three-pointers) for a baseline three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams goes to its vaunted 1-3-1 zone press -- something we didn’t witness against Wilton -- Rosa (4.9 ppg, 12 3s) and Alseph (6.3 ppg, 17 3s) are there for steals and lay-ups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rivoira (7.9 ppg, 12 3s) always seems poised for a timely three, a put-back or a tough and-1 as he attacks the hoop with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This squad is the ultimate, undefeated team in the state of Connecticut at 27-0 and is, perhaps, on the cusp of something extraordinary -- a CIAC Division II title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But don’t forget, Wilton had a boatload of seniors in its program too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 54-52 overtime win for Central over Wilton was that close because over a dozen seniors left their imprint on an amazing game people won’t soon forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Wilton] had seven seniors on their roster as well so you had two senior laden teams going at each other that don’t want to go home. [It was] nothing less than a war,” Barrette said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But I tell my guys all the time I am glad I can go to war with my five seniors any day of the week.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the Central program is just over a day away from its first championship tilt since 1990.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you better believe that Central’s senior class is going to pounce all over Northwest Catholic (25-2) to seize its second ever state championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve got us this far,” said Barrette of the seniors. “We’ve got to take care of business on Saturday.”&nbsp;</p>
