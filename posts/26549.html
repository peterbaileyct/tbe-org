<p>The Bristol Youth Lacrosse Senior girls squad was at it again on Thursday, this time battling the competition from Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals were playing up a level, but it didn’t matter as the program from Bristol remained undefeated by the completion of the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals spun the Simsbury Blue squad by a 13-5 final, leading from wire to wire, from Bristol Eastern’s front lacrosse field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is now 6-0 as Simsbury was down, and out, from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol went ahead in the fray by a 7-1 push, never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all the stars from the Bristol program played extremely well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program's two leading scorers, Savannah Drury and Harper Dauphinee, pressed all the right buttons offensively - nabbing several goals apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Bristol squad, Makinzey Welch flashed in two goals while Riley Bash, Natalia Vye and Chloe LaBrecque all tallied a score to help produce the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We held another opponent to five goals with excellent goal tending from Tegan Freimuth,” said Bristol coach John Stavens. “Amelia Dailega and Ella Smith were tenacious defensively guarding the net.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens also credited McKenna Bell for her defensive efforts which included plenty of strong play and lots of on the field talk with her teammates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allison Craig had an excellent game as well for the Bristol team, contributing at several different positions to help keep the program remain undefeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The coaches</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls are coached by John Stavens, a strong supporter of lacrosse in town for several years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His assistants include Marc Ciechoski, Casey Cyr, Chuck Drury and Hector Ramirez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>League Games show Bristol’s dominance</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s matches this season - at least the first four against Avon, Newington, West Hartford and RHAM - prove that the competition can’t keep up offensively with the girls from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Mum City has an excellent program that is still building and growing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since defeating Avon on April 19, the scores haven’t really been that close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After allowing the Avon squad seven goals, the girls from Bristol gave up just 10 total over a three-match stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When your youth team allows 3.3 goals-per-game over three-match set, that’s pretty impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
