<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - Zone 1 in Senior American Legion Baseball in Connecticut looks a little bit different in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course mainstay Bristol is always a threat in the division and the same will be true this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon, the 2021 state champions, did not field a team this season while Berlin also folded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just recently, Naugatuck – who linked up with Zone 1 for the first time in 2021 – folded as the division is short a few programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there won’t be any shortage of competition over the rest of the zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington has reestablished its Senior program while Simsbury – enduring an unusually down season last year – is looking to rebound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington and Meriden should provide quality competition but the team from West Hartford, always a very good program, should be one of the top two squads in the league – along with Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"[This year], it's really between us and them," said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of West Hartford. "The goal is to always win the series. So if we take three-out-of-four from everybody else, and we split with these guys, will be right there in the end for the zone [title]."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"That's the ultimate goal and then we get into the playoffs."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, Seicheprey Post 2 will play each Zone 1 team four times unlike past seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, each zone program played every squad three times but Zone 1, obviously, is short a few teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden has some pop as well but the locals, playing all its home games from Muzzy Field, should be more than competitive with a very veteran crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several 19 year old’s returned to the fold for Bristol including former All-Stater Andrew Lozier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Lozier came down and got a game in today" against West Hartford said LaPenta. "We're trying to get him to get enough games to qualify for the playoffs."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier will be playing in multiple leagues this season after a very good freshman campaign at Avery Point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta will work around Lozier's schedule to keep him playing, and eligible, for Post 2 beyond the regular season, into the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don't forget, Lozier can throw the ball a little bit and LaPenta will give him a starting assignment or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He should be available for seven or eight games," said LaPenta of Lozier. "We'll get him on the mound for a couple games too, get two or three starts out of him."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier has high expectations for this team as many of the 19-year old's at this level do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He recently said he’s returning to the squad in part to help Post 2 win a state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team was right there in the state tournament fray in 2021, making the Northern Regional semifinals but was eliminated by Avon (1-0) back on August 5 from Rotary Field in South Windsor to finish out the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Avon out of the way – a squad that truly became one of Bristol’s fiercest rivals since the program was established – Post 2 is looking for a Zone 1 championship, move on to the states from there and perhaps get some additional hardware to open the month of August.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol looking to replace games</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Naugatuck out of the picture, Bristol will attempt to replace those four games with games out of the Zone 1 fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always tough to schedule those exhibition contests with limited pitchers, pitch counts and the like to deal with – especially if Mother Nature decides to knockout a game or two due to rain, thunderstorms, and all the goodies summer weather brings – clustering games at the worst possible time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a chance to compete in a game from Muzzy Field is always an attractive proposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The remaining schedule for the month of June</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has seven games remaining on its schedule this month, starting this Thursday with a rematch against Meriden at 5:45 p.m. from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Friday, Post 2 finally hits the road – in a showdown against Simsbury from Memorial Field at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, Bristol travels to Torrington for a Zone 1 tilt at 2 p.m. from Fuessenich Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following week, Bristol plays just once – a contest against Simsbury on June 26 at 5:45 p.m. from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, June 26, it’s a twin bill from Bristol as Torrington comes to town for games at 1 and 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Tuesday, June 28, Post 2 battles West Hartford on the road at 5:45 p.m. from Conard High School.</p>
