<p>BRISTOL - After the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball program eliminated Enfield over a wild 8-7 final in Northern Division, Pod C postseason play on Tuesday evening, Post 2 earned a chance to compete for a berth at the Connecticut Super Regionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory propelled Bristol to the final day of pod play and now must defeat top-seeded Waterford twice on Wednesday to qualify for the Super Regionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game one is slated for 5:30 p.m. from Waterford High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bristol can hang a loss on Waterford (23-3), a second game will take place about 45 minutes after the completion of the first in a winner-take-all Pod C finale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Post 2 will give its best shot against Waterford as pitcher Dylan Woodsome, the winner in relief against Enfield from Muzzy Field, staying under the pitch count for a mandatory day of rest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker has won three games this season and will be looking for another victory against one of the best teams in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everything had to go right in the top of the eighth frame against Enfield in a 7-7 tie for Woodsome in order for him to be eligible to throw against Watertown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the top of the eighth, he had ten pitches” left said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Woodsome against Enfield. “I had no one left to pitch [against Waterford]. I had to save him for [Wednesday] and he gets out of the inning in eight pitches so he’ll start against Waterford.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s unbelievable.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome allowed a singe hit in the eighth - throwing just two balls and six strikes to earn a shot at Waterford on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up throwing total 29 pitches to keep his eligibility for the showdown at Watertown.</p>
