<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central wrestling squad had a tough back-to-back challenge against Edwin O. Smith and Berlin this past Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fun started against the Panthers as the Rams improved to 6-0 with a 37-28 win on senior night from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith proved to be tough up and down the card but, with standouts like senior Will Hamilton at the ready, Central was able to square up another huge win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 113 pounds, Central’s Joseph Niek won via forfeit, as did teammate Julian Colon (120) before Hamilton (126) went to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior toppled Smith’s Caleb Phillips by a 12-4 decision while at 132, the Rams’ Aiden Lamarre topped Osei-tutu Hansen over a tough 11-9 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lincoln Archibald (138) earned a forfeit win while captain Umar Malick (152) earned a big come from behind decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malick toppled the Panthers’ Dakota Blanchard over a 5-2 final over a tremendous finish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 170 pounds, Jack Jones won via a forfeit decision and at 182, Central’s Jayden Colon defeated Alexander Barr with a 6-5 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BC wrestling on Twitter said that Malick earned the ‘Animal Award’ for his come-from-behind victory .&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then one night later on the road, the Central program lost for the first time this year, falling at Berlin, 62-15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats raised its ledger to 11-1 overall and 5-0 in the CCC South while the Rams dropped to 6-1 (4-1 CCC South).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamilton (126) pinned Jonah Lorenzo in only 12 seconds, Malick (160) drew a pinfall win over Mantas Malinauskas, and Jayden Colon (182) took a 4-3 decision over Berlins’s Tim Mrachek to lead Central.</p>

<p>The annual BC/BE wrestling meet - slated for the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on Wednesday, February 9 at 6 p.m. - should be as competitive as it comes this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had a busy weekend if the schedule held because on Saturday, Central battled New Fairfield, Bethel, Haddam-Killingworth, Jonathan Law, Londonberry (NH), Masuk, Nonnewaug, Simsbury, and Harding from New Fairfield high school.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the mats…</strong>Senior captain Will Hamilton is ranked #3 in New England and is simply a beast at 120 pounds. The grappler is also successful up the card at 126. The rankings were compiled as of January 26.&nbsp;</p>
