<p>Bristol- Over the years, Platt high school has proven to have a very good wrestling program - always challenging the teams from the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Wednesday night, Bristol Eastern was able to wrangle up a win, downing the Panthers via a 43-30 home victory.</p>

<p>The Lancers, now 3-2 overall (2-0 CCC South), made some big gains over the meet as Platt (12-5) lost for only the fifth time in 17 outings.</p>

<p>Both sides earned forfeit wins over the fray while at 113 pounds, Eastern’s Luke Viens got to the pay window - pinning Platt’s Nathaniel Ortiz in 3:03 - while Anthony Silva (120) did not have a competitor to square off against.</p>
