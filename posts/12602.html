<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern softball program has been on a roll as of late and in the first contest of a three-game homestand, the Lancers started off in winning fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a tough 2-1 setback at Glastonbury the previous Monday, the Kingstreeters bounced right back against Wethersfield – sinking the Eagles by a 12-6 final from the famed Thunderdome on the campus of BEHS on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional engagement saw the Lancers improve to 3-3 on the season while the Eagles fell to 3-2 – seeing their two-game winning streak snapped in the process.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And how many home runs did Eastern senior Janessa Gonzalez tally against Wethersfield that day?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exact answer is two as she smacked a couple balls over the fence at Eastern – one being of the grand slam variety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Gonzalez wasn’t the only batter to drop in a homer that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin canned a three-run homerun to augment the offense while Makayla Antunes added three hits to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ali Tellier also collected three hits and Emily Valentine tallied two – all adding something to the outstanding effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next on the schedule for the Lancers is a date against CCC competitor Conard on Friday at 4 p.m. while Platt is on the docket come Monday (3:45 p.m.).</p>
