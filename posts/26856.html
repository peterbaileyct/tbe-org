<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, the Bristol Eastern softball team became the squad no one wanted to play in the Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the Lancers made it all the way to the semifinals, falling to eventual champion Masuk by a 3-0 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Eastern squad, headlined by the outstanding battery of Ali Tellier and Janessa Gonzalez, defeated the twelfth, fifth and fourth ranked teams in the Class L field before falling to the future champs from Monroe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But fast forward one year and the 2023 outfit on King Street, playing a very tough regular season worth of contests in the always loaded CCC, is ready for the challenge of the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Tuesday, it begins all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern finished the regular season at a credible 11-9 overall</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the Lancers had an excellent year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forgot about the two games against Bristol Central (21-2), contests that the Lancers got a jump on but could not finish against one of Connecticut’s top programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-3 start, the Lancers went 10-5 over their final 15 games before dropping a tough 14-2 decision to Central to end the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve exceeded my expectations,” said Eastern coach Tyler Catlin. “They’ve definitely overachieved. A lot of them improved. We have 18 ladies in that dugout, and I think they’ve all gotten a little bit better.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, the team is led by Class L All State selection Emily Valentine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s been the real deal, batting .485 from the plate which includes 33 hits, 32 runs scored and 26 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten of her hits went for extra bases, including two home runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Jazmyn Brown (.344, 21 hits, 23 runs scored, eight RBI) brings the defense around the horn and can hit the ball a little bit as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior pitcher Ashley Serafin chucked around 100 innings this season and while they’re flashier names around the CCC in the circle, the BE standout always throws a quality game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s a veteran hand and can’t be underestimated as a leader on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin batted .333 while scooping in 17 hits and 22 RBI, Kayla Webber posted a .321 average with 18 hits and three triples, while Gracie Browne (.286 average, 18 hits, 23 runs and 14 RBI) and Makayla Antunes (15 hits and 10 RBI on .273 batting at the plate) all performed well for the CCC South program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Beebe, Sarah Lacouture, Leah Webber, Gracie LaMar, among others, have had big seasons for the Kingstreeters – getting better as the season wore on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Me and my assistant coach [Rico Lodovico], everyone got a little better,” said Catlin. “But I’m really impressed with the growth we’ve made. I’m looking forward to going to the states.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BE opens at Nonnewaug</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers drew an interesting first round opponent in the form of No. 11 Nonnewaug (14-6 regular season) of the Berkshire League (3:30 p.m.) in Class L, first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BL isn’t the best league in terms of softball, top to bottom, but the squad battled a couple good opponents along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Chiefs went 11-3 in Berkshire League play, good for second place in the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is led by seniors Sarah Cipriani (.463, 31 hits, 30 RBI, 34 runs scored), and Allysa Calabrese (.456, 36 hits, 33 RBI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cipriani is a hitting machine, smashing out 11 doubles, two triples and three home runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad carried a 2.25 ERA this season, led by Calabrese (11-2 overall, 126 strikeouts to 19 walks).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents batted just .192 against the senior standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonnewaug drew two losses against Pomperaug and lost one run decisions against Shepaug, Thomaston, and Naugatuck over a more than competitive campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the advice Catlin gives to his team about postseason play is plain and simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Throw strikes, catch the ball and get some timely hits,” said Catlin. “That’s what it’s all about. Anybody can win in the states. And I said to the team last year, you win the first two [games] and anything can happen. It doesn’t matter who you’re playing at that point.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I would echo that same sentiment this year. You go out and you win that first game, who knows what’s going to happen.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Eastern gets out of the first round, the squad gets the winner of No. 6 Rockville and No. 27 Torrington, coached by old friend Sarah Arburr, in second round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The possibility of No. 3 Law (18-2 regular season), No. 14 Brookfield (13-7) or No. 19 Wethersfield (12-8) looms as opponents in quarterfinal round play if the Lancers can advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best advice for opponents when tangling against Eastern is to never underestimate the squad, especially in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We’ll] see what happens,” said Caitlin. “Maybe we’ll make another run. Who knows.”</p>
