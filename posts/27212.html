<p>BRISTOL - Nearly three-and-a-half hours of baseball on Thursday night couldn’t determine a victor between the Bristol and NCL American Legion baseball squads from Muzzy Field in Zone 3 competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through ten innings, the game was a 6-6 stalemate and after 10:30 p.m. on a weeknight, a new inning could not commence in Bristol due to curfew rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at some point, during the season, these squads will recommence play to determine a winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did these teams get to the tenth inning over this 6-6 marvel?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a <em>quick </em>summary of all the scoring from the event:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL - Top of the first</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Oberle dropped an infield bunt with one away, moved to second base on a passed ball and scored off a single by Allen Hinckley to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol - Bottom of the third</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio earned a base-on-balls with one away and when Cole Maccano belted a double to the gap in left, men were on second and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio came home on a wild pitch as the game was all tied at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the scoring in the third, Connor Cyr (three RBI) dropped a long fly ball to left for the second out - allowing Maccano to score from third base - as it was a 2-1 game in Post 2’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL - Top of the fourth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NCL retied the game, this time at 2-2, as back-to-back doubles by Jaydon Ramirez and Xavier Angel netted a run to make it an even-steven game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol - Bottom of the fifth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 wasted very little time in the bottom of the fifth as Maglio singled, representing the go-ahead run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was erased on a 4-6 fielder’s choice from Maccano but Rio Fernandez absolutely crushed a long fly ball to center, watching it drop towards the warning track and scoring Maccano, giving Bristol a 3-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on a passed ball, Fernandez got to third base safety and off a bad throw-in by the NCL catcher, the runner came home to make it a 4-2 game through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL - Top of the sixth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allen Hinckley drained a double to the gap in right and Frankie Kula was then plunked by a pitch, putting two on with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ramirez walked to load things up and Bristol starting pitcher Logan Schenck (79 pitches, six hits, three earned runs, five strikeouts, two walks) who performed well over the no-decision, was relieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Roalf took over for Schenck, but a wild pitch scored Hinckley to trim the deficit to 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL - Top of the seventh</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Batters 8-9-1 were due up as Roalf was attempting to save the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parker Thomen walked and quickly stole second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf induced a strikeout, but Thomen took third on a wild pitch and Garrett Hinckley drove in the tying run as his single to right was almost caught by Maccano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thomen ended up scoring to make it a brand new game at 4-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL - Top of the ninth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Garrett Hinckley drew a one-out walk in the top of the ninth, later stealing second and Oberle singled to left, putting runners on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Jayden Churchill strikeout (five strikeouts), Kula kicked a long double to left - clearing the bases - as NCL scooped up a 6-4 lead going into the bottom of the ninth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol - Bottom of the ninth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had its top of the order up and Elliot Norris (two hits) put the ball in play to shortstop - who badly booted the ball - as Post 2 had some life.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio zipped a ball up the gut, putting two on with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on a full count, Maccano walked as the bases were loaded.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr ending up sending a slicer into center, plating Churchill and Maglio, as the game was quickly knotted at 6-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maccano attempted to score from third base on the play, attempting to score the game-winning run, but was easily tagged out at the dish as the game continued into the tenth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The non-scoring 10th inning - NCL</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two retired in the top of the tenth, Thomen unleashed a double down the line in left but Churchill earned his fifth strikeout to end the half inning and due to curfew rules, Post 2 had to score something in the bottom of the frame to end it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The non-scoring 10th inning - Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Issac Roberge drew four balls with one out, Roalf hit into a fielder’s choice but Norris’s grounder to third was thrown away at first, putting runners at second and third and Churchill at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Churchill ended up grounding out to shortstop to end the tenth and at 6-6, the game will be continued another day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>If you’re on vacation and attempt to cover a 10-inning game, not making it back to the cottage you’re staying at on time, you’ll probably end up in the doghouse.&nbsp;</p>
