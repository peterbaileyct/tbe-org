<p>One hundred three years ago, in 1919, Babe Ruth hit his historic home run over the right field fence at Muzzy Field. The ball was never found, and legend had it that the ball landed in the Pequabuck River, floating away into history.</p>

<p>Many intrepid explorers searched for that ball, but it seemingly was lost forever.</p>

<p>But just today, Saturday, August 13, 2022, the ever-resourceful photographer for our own Bristol Edition, Johann Itzkramp, discovered the legendary baseball on the bank of the Pequabuck near the Rockwell swimming pool.</p>

<p>If you look carefully, you will notice that Mr. Ruth almost knocked the cover off the ball. The ball is being delivered on Monday to Cooperstown for authentication. Itâ€™s estimated worth was $6.77 in 1919, but has increased over the century to $22.33.</p>

<p>Mr. Itzkramp has pledged to donate the money to the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
