<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The records between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern on Turkey Day are certainly an interesting read.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some of the state’s best athletes have helped to compile those outstanding records, figures and statistics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From speedster Timmy Washington to quarterback Dennis Schermerhorn to the ultra-talented Jeff Castolene, several warriors have helped establish some of the very best standards on Thanksgiving from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look – via the Bristol Central website – of a portion of the Thanksgiving Day records from the historic Battle for the Bell:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Game Day Records: Individual</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Most touchdowns – 5, Tim Washington (Bristol Central), 2000 &amp; Victor Rosa (Bristol Central), 2019</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Washington made scoring runs of 40, 2, 4, 11 and 69 yards in the victory over Eastern. He ended the season tied for the state record in touchdowns scored in a single season with 42.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Rosa matched that feat in 2019 in the overtime victory over the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most yards rushing – 353 yards, Tim Washington (Bristol Central), 2000</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Washington ended the year with 3,005 yards, a state record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most yards passing – 308 yards, Dennis Schermerhorn (Bristol Eastern), 1970</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Schmaltz gathered up 161 yards on those eight catches and scored a touchdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Gagliardo matched that same feat 47 years later.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most receiving yards – 161 yards, Rick Schmaltz (Bristol Eastern), 1970</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most TD passes – 3, Dennis Schermerhorn (Bristol Eastern), 1969 and 1970</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Eastern won those games by a combined 59-28 score, seizing the win over back-to-back campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest run from scrimmage – 87 yards, Gregg Vontell (Bristol Central), 1982</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>The halfback made his historic rush in the second quarter; Vontell scored three times that day over runs of 87, 80 and 24 yards. Overall, he scooped up 235 yards on 20 carries for a big day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest pass completion – 82 yards, Kiernan Thurston (Bristol Central) and 82 yards, John Laviero both from Marvin Fitzpatrick, 1988</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Central QB Marvin Fitzpatrick found both John Laviero and Kiernan Thurston for 82-yard receptions. That’s a crazy day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest fumble return – 70 yards, Edgar Hernandez (Bristol Eastern), 2016</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Merriam nabbed a pass by Eastern’s Julio Maisonet and ran it in for the game’s third score of the day. From 1975 through 1984, Central went undefeated against Eastern on T-Day.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most field goals – 1, Bill Woods (Bristol Eastern), 1996, Jeremy Meccariello (Bristol Eastern), 2012</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest field goal – 25, Jeremy Meccariello (Bristol Eastern), 2012</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
