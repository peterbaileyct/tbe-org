<p>Bristol's public schools have fared well academically when it comes to student achievement over the pandemic through this past school year, according to research from the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University, which has built the first national database of student achievement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, the New York Times published a story based on the Stanford study of public-school test scores in math and reading and the effects of Covid restrictions on school districts across the United States. The study shed light on the significant impact that the pandemic has had on student learning outcomes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study analyzed test scores from over 18 million students across the United States and found that Covid-related school closures and disruptions have led to significant declines in academic achievement, particularly in math.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition studied the scores of Bristol students to see if they followed the pattern described in the Stanford research. What we found was that Bristol was impacted by the effects of COVID like school districts all over the state, but the Bristol schools rebounded exceptionally well since 2019 and actually surpassed their 2019 scores by the time of the 2023 test period.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Public Schools outperformed the state in the following categories:</strong></p>

<li>-Overall Accountability Index</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>-ELA (English Language Arts) Growth (All Students)</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>-Math Growth (All Students)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TBE looked especially at the Bristol schools in comparison to their District Reference Group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The District Reference Groups (DRGs) are a classification system that groups local and regional public-school districts together based on the similar socioeconomic status of their students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DRGs were developed by the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE). The School and State Finance Project has updated the DRGs for 2023 using the most recent data. Similar to the original DRGs, <u><span style="text-decoration: underline;">these 2023 DRGs are not official and meant only for research and reference use.</span></u></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the revised rankings, the Bristol School System is placed in Group G. The following cities are in the group:</p>

<p>One of the key findings of the Stanford University study is that students in both elementary and middle schools experienced substantial learning loss in math, with the average student falling behind by five months in math compared to previous years. This decline in math achievement is particularly concerning, as math skills are foundational to success in many other academic subjects and in the workforce. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the study found that the learning loss was more pronounced for students from low-income communities, exacerbating existing educational inequities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see in the following graph, Bristol students did not fall behind, but instead finished two months ahead in their math scores from 2019 to 2023. And they have the top result in their entire DRG.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some districts in Group G were found to be over one entire grade year behind, which illustrates how impressive Bristol's scores are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the negative impact on math achievement, the Stanford study also found that there were declines in reading proficiency, though they were less pronounced than those in math. The study suggests that the disruptions caused by Covid-related school closures, remote learning, and other restrictions have had a detrimental effect on students' literacy skills as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In ELA (English Language Arts), Bristol again outperformed the state average and their DRG school districts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Superintendent of Schools Dr. Catherine Carbone said she was very pleased with the Bristol schools and their results. She offered this observation: "It is undeniable that BPS scholars have performed better than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"These achievements begin with the dedication of our teachers and staff, as well the Office of Teaching and Learning. Our comprehensive definition of high-quality teaching referred to as 'North Stars' describes the core tenets of our approach; professional learning, curriculum, and instruction practices."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carbone went on to say, "Vigilantly monitoring and fine-tuning our district priorities and action plans, we have actively worked to enhance performance and achieve our mission of teaching and learning with passion and purpose."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Stanford study has important implications for educational policy and practice. It highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the learning loss experienced by students during the pandemic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of addressing educational inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Low-income students and students from marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by the disruptions to schooling, and it is crucial to prioritize their needs in the recovery efforts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may involve targeted funding and resources to support the most vulnerable students, as well as addressing broader systemic inequities in the education system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Schools have shown resilience in the face of the COVID disruptions to learning and are on a solid path to achievement in the future.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
