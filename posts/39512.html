<p>Looking to bounce back from its only loss of the season, the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team ended a stretch of three games in four nights against undefeated Berlin on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown, contested from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol, ended up going down to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took a little heroics by the squad’s sophomore sensation Autumn Udoh to ice the contest in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 33.6 seconds to play in regulation, Autumn Udoh drained a clutch three-pointer, giving Eastern the lead for good at 36-34.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Redcoats had a chance to tie up the event late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After one free throw apiece from Vanessa Drury and Cassie Sward - stretching the edge out to three (37-34) with eight seconds left - Berlin took two more shots at it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late three-pointer did not find the mark and neither did the offensive rebound and put-back as the Kingstreeters won it by three, 37-34.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern ended its 2023 portion of the schedule at 6-1 while Berlin fell to 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh ended the afternoon with 12 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks to pace the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury added seven points, two assists and two steals while Cassie Sward went 2-for-2 from downtown, good for seven points.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel posted six points, eight rebounds and five blocks over a big defensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Savannah Drury dropped in five points and two assists, Lauren Ayotte hustled for eight rebounds, two assists and a couple steals while Natalia Vye and Alaina Joy each played critical minutes over the big victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats struggled from the field, making their first field goal with 6:37 left to go in the second period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin led for all of 15 seconds in the first half, lost its lead to end the third, regained it early in the fourth before the game-winning shot by Udoh made things academic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were only four lead changes in the showdown but free throws helped to keep the Redcoats in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maddy Sadowski had a team-high 11 points while Brooke Walker added&nbsp;10 for Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the contest, Ayotte found Vanessa Drury for a 3, Noel then added a high-percentage bucket and when Udoh connected on two free throws with about seven minutes remaining before the half, Eastern constructed a 8-4 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte once again dished off to Vanessa Drury for another trifecta late in the second stanza and when Savannah Drury tossed in a floater with 1:08 to go before the break, Eastern nabbed an 18-15 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But late hoops from Brooke Walker (10 points) and Emma Ellison (six points) propelled Berlin to a 19-18 edge at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern made just one basket in the third tilt but it gave the home program a late advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noel dropped in a free throw, Udoh went 5-of-6 from the line, and when Sward drained her first 3 of the game, the Lancers carried a slim 27-26 push into the fourth and final quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the game went back-and-forth until the final horn sounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by three, Sward dropped in her second three to tie things up but one final Berlin three-point bomb had the visiting aggression rolling up a 34-31 lead with 3:03 left in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern ramped up the defense and off a steal by Vanessa Drury, Noel slipped in a free throw to trim the deficit to 34-32 with 1:22 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh added a huge block off a Berlin shot attempt and then the duo of Udoh and Vanessa Drury forced a jump ball with 49.3 seconds remaining as the Lancers were still down by two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To put the game away, Vanessa Drury found Udoh - coming off a double screen by Ayotte and Noel - and the sophomore hit the game-winning 3 with 33.6 seconds left, watching the ball roll around the rim before eventually falling in - pushing the Eastern lead to 35-34 and Berlin was down and out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late timeouts and missed opportunities foiled the Redcoats as Eastern’s defense held Berlin scoreless over the final 3:03 - snaring a huge 37-34 win in the end to move to 6-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
