<h4>The following is a press release from Wheeler Clinic Foster Care.</h4>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Connecticut, on any given day, there are hundreds of youth who need loving foster homes, and most are over the age of 13 years old. May is National Foster Care Month, a time to consider the many youth in need of loving homes, especially teens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Prospective foster and adoptive parents often express a preference for younger children,” said Sharon Pendleton-Ponzani, LCSW, director, Wheeler Foster Care Services. “But nationally, and here in Connecticut, there is a critical need for families for teens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The experience of fostering a teen is different but can be just as rewarding,” Pendleton-Ponzani added. “It’s an important, worthwhile process of helping with important life tasks such as helping youth enroll in higher education, find stable housing, securing employment, establishing healthy relationships, and so much more.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Studies show that teens who age out of foster care or who do not have more permanent, loving attachments are at increased risk for homelessness, young parenthood, low educational attainment, high unemployment rates, human trafficking, and other adverse adult outcomes.</p>
