<p>The Bristol American baseball team carried a ten game winning streak into the state tournament this week, including their tenth win over Ridgefield. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately for Bristol, that same Ridgefield team held them to two hits and only one run in defeating Bristol, 6-1, on Tuesday night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss knocked Bristol into the loser’s bracket, where they faced Glastonbury on Wednesday. They bounced back from the Tuesday disappointment by beating Glastonbury at Muzzy Field by a score of 8-3. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was only able to scratch out four hits in the contest, but the opponent helped by committing a few key errors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Declan Schenck pitched five and two thirds solid innings to gain the win, and Ryan Maglio closed it out with a perfect inning and a third in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a reward, Bristol gets to play Ridgefield again hoping for an offensive rebound. The game is tonight at Muzzy Field. The tournament website lists the game for 5:30. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bristol wins, they will advance to the next round double elimination in either South Windsor or Middletown starting on July 27.</p>
