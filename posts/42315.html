<p>The Bristol Eastern boys team met a tall and talented opponent Friday night, and when that was coupled with a frigid shooting night for the Lancers, it spelled the end of their excellent season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Innovation, with Amari Cruz and Ibrahim Sidik controlling the inside at both ends of the court and with excellent outside shooting by Jamal Kulaib,  shut down Bristol Eastern  64-36.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For one quarter, the game went back and forth, with Innovation leading 12-10 with neither team leading by more than two. Sidik had five hoops inside for 10 of the Innovation points.  Innovation shot 6 for 15, while Eastern hit on 5 of 13.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second period, a hoop by Eastern’s Dante DePass midway through the quarter brought Eastern to within two, at 20-18, but then Innnovation went on a 7-0 run to open up a 27-18 lead in the closing seconds of the half. A hoop by Brayden Dauphinais late made it a 27-20 game at intermission. The Lancers seemingly were right in the battle.</p>

<p>But when the second half began, everything went south. Eastern shot very poorly, lower than 25% from the floor, and was  outscored 37-16 inthe half (17-5 in the third period.).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Innovation’s Kulaib opened the third quarter with a three from the corner and  connected on three of his five 3's in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern managed only a single three by Ben D'Amato at the 3:40 mark, and a hoop by Zaveyn Tate at the 1:50 mark, and Eastern trailed 44-25 after three periods. Eastern seemingly had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The casket was closed when Innovation opened the fourth with a 9-0 run to open the lead to 53-25. There was no answer from the Lancers as no one could get a shot to drop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the game, not a single Eastern player finished in double figures. That just about tells the entire story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final game for seniors Brayden Dauphinais, Lukas Sward, Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum, Ben D'Amato, and Ben Kozikowski. They were the leaders of a four year renaissance for the Lancer basketball program, bringing the team from the doormat of the CCC to a respected foe for every team they faced. They will certainly be missed.</p>
