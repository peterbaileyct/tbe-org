<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - For the past couple seasons, opponents of the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team have simply not been able to score off of pitching standout Roberto Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Sunday, Meriden was stuck in that same rut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz was sensational from start to finish as Post 2 nabbed a huge 8-1 decision from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was the Zone 1 opener for both teams as Bristol (1-1) never wavered thanks to all the dealing Cruz was doing from the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve never had anyone go 7-0 and didn’t give up an earned run last year,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Cruz. “He didn’t play in college and he hasn’t pitched in over a year except for that inning he threw [Saturday] night. He threw a complete game and stayed under 100 pitches against aluminum bats.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s just a bulldog.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta also hit for Cruz, allowing the chucker to focus on pitching which helped him keep his energy on a level high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz threw a one-run, three-hit, two walk, and seven strikeout gem that saw him throw 96 pitches to earn his first win of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 45 battered .136 for the game as the visiting aggression scored one run in the fourth frame when Alex Owen dropped in an RBI single but that offense didn’t mean much in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the hit-a-thon was on from the start as Post 2 smacked out 13 hits - all singles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max Giacco (5 IP) dropped a tough decision, allowing 11 hits and eight runs though only two were earned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden had more errors (four) than hits (three) but it was only the first contest for a team that will be much improved as the year moves along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first, Meriden’s - and St. Paul Catholic standout - John Remillard (1-3) dropped a one-out slicer into right field and advanced to second via steal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to end the frame, Cruz picked off the runner at second as Bristol came to bat for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Elliot Norris started the fun with a grounder that got by the third baseman and shortstop as Post 2 had its leadoff man on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Jayden Churchill followed up with a sharp single to left as Norris rounded second base - attempting to reach third on the play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he was gunned down in left by Remillard for the first out while Churchill advanced to third on a groundout from Adam Caron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Churchill charged the plate, attempting to steal home on a 2-1 count, but Meriden catcher Ted Hanjewski made a slick tag to get the speedster for the third out as the game remained scoreless through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hanjewski started the second stanza with a base-on-balls but nothing came of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a fielder’s choice, Luis DelGado was struck out by Cruz and Owen flew-out to right to end the half inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the second, Bristol blitzed Meriden for five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette’s grounder to third was thrown away at first base as Post 2 started the attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Fradette at second, Dillon Hudson laid down a sacrifice bunt that was fielded by the pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But again, the ball was misplayed to first and on the second consecutive error by Post 45, Fradette scooted home to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Hudson stationed at second base off the gaffe, Tyler Stickles advanced the runner to third on a groundout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then off Matt Beaucar’s sacrifice fly to center, Hudson tagged the dish as it became a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was more to come as Tyler Martin singled, stole second, and came around to score when Chris Osuch dropped a base hit into center - making it 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Osuch eventually scored on a passed ball and when Churchill ended the jaunt with a sharp single to center, Norris came home as Bristol held an imposing 5-0 cushion through just two completed innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It just looked like a totally different team than [Saturday] night” against Tri-County said LaPenta, a contest Bristol lost 9-4 on Saturday. “We got a little rust off and made plays.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz produced his fourth strikeout in the third tilt to keep Meriden off the scoreboard while Fradette singled up the middle to start the bottom half of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone, Fradette easily stole second but never advanced as Post 45 entered the fourth inning still trailing by five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz retired eight straight before plunking Hanjewski with a pitch but was thrown out by Osuch when the big man attempted to swipe second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe Zamorano then walked and Luis Delgado singled to left as Meriden had two on with two gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owen followed with a hard single to center that scored Zamorano from second as Meriden got on the board but trailed 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Cruz picked off Delgado attempting to steal and the rally was snuffed out with Bristol leading by four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giacco retired six straight to keep the locals at bay to end the fourth while it was back to business for the Bristol defense in the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz tallied another K, helping Bristol go 1-2-3, as Meriden’s struggles at the plate continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then made it 3-for-3 with a zinger to left while Caron got to first via a fielder’s choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We only have two full-time high school kids on the team,” said LaPenta of Norris and Churchill. “The other four guys are dual rostered. They’ve been playing all along, I put them at the top of the line-up and Elliot and Jayden set the table. They’re fast and can play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron quickly stole second while Fradette produced Bristol’s ninth hit - running out a deep infield tally to short - as two runners were on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Hudson dropped a base hit into right which should have loaded the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomfoolery on the base paths eventually saw Caron tagged out at third for the second out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, a hit-and-run by Stickles saw the batter collect two RBI and after two errors, he eventually scored on a surprise version of the ‘Bristol pickle’ as Meriden fell behind 8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We ran some trick plays on them,” said LaPenta. “On first and third, we did some delayed steals and you can tell they weren’t a unit yet.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin then slapped a base hit up the middle while Osuch added a single to left to open the sixth while a double steal put both runners into scoring position but nothing came of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the seventh, Cruz sealed the deal by going the distance as Bristol earned a big 8-1 win from Muzzy Field - displaying a complete game effort on both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pitching and defense, we had a big fat zero for errors,” said LaPenta. “I think we had four or five two-out hits with guys in scoring position. I said if we get hits with guys on base with two outs, we’re going to win games this year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got a nice win against Meriden, it’s good, but it’s not going to get any easier [Monday] against West Hartford.”</p>
