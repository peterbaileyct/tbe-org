<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have admired—well, not admired, but commented on our lawn, spotted as it is with wild onion plants—on our way to Mass. Afterwards, we will have stopped in at the Bakery on Maple where we picked up a loaf of rye (I added a chocolate bread pudding for a treat later). </p>

<p>I quizzed Dave about a new type of bread being displayed, a French Fougasse, a pinwheel of a bread with spokes, if you will. He said it&nbsp;was a last-minute inspiration. Weighing in about two pounds with a crispy crust from all the surfaces exposed while it was in the oven, it made an impression. I was tempted but decided one loaf of bread was enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the week was quiet one here, except for some work being done on the house. Having raised a bunch of kids over many years, and putting off most work, except for necessary repairs, until they were on their own, we woke up one morning and thought it would be nice to dress things up. And so it began, the work, which meant boxing up all my books—around 50 boxes of them—and shuffling things around a bit.</p>

<p>For this week’s listening/reading, let’s try this: “Grain Wars,” an episode of Open Source with Christopher Lydon. Open Source totes itself, and rightly so, as the world’s longest-running podcast. Click <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/grain-war/id73330619?i=1000559010413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. If you’d like something shorter, there is always poetry. Try Poetry Unbound and Rita Dove’s poem, “Eurydice, Turning.” Click <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/rita-dove-eurydice-turning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
