<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The replacement of the railroad crossing on Route 6 at the intersection of Farmington Avenue and Burlington Avenue is anticipated to take place in mid-July, according to the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The existing railroad crossing is being completely replaced with all-new materials to enhance safety, provide a smooth passage for motorists, as well as ensuring the long-term viability of freight rail service in the region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work to replace the railroad crossing will require a vehicle detour for approximately three days during construction. Bicyclists and pedestrians will still be able to cross through a designated area and will not be detoured. Posted State Highway detours will utilize routes 229, 72, and 69 to bypass the construction site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Motorists and commercial vehicle operators are required to utilize posted detour routes to avoid local streets and low underpasses<em>.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All businesses on Route 6 will remain accessible throughout the short-term construction project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the nearby railroad crossing at Maple Avenue will also be replaced as part of this project, the release states. Only one railroad crossing will be closed at any given time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This work – funded through a CTDOT Rail Freight Improvement Program (RFIP) grant – is being performed in coordination between the CTDOT, City of Bristol, first responders, bus and transit providers, and Berkshire and Eastern Railroad (the company that owns the freight rail line).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An additional announcement, complete with detour route, will be released when the construction date is finalized. Members of the public with questions are encouraged to contact the CTDOT Customer Care Center at (860) 594-3062 or <a href="mailto:DOT.CustomerCare@ct.gov">DOT.CustomerCare@ct.gov</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
