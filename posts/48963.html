<p>Bristol residents from City Council District 3 casting ballots in today's special election will have the choice of two "I voted" stickers when leaving the polls at Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stickers, one a star with "I voted!" written inside against the background of an American flag and the other "I voted" written in red magic marker with a small American flag above "voted" and an image of Connecticut with the Bristol logo inside, are the winners of the 1st Annual "I Voted" Sticker Contest held by the City of Bristol Registrars of Voters office.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creator of the first image, with the star, is Samantha Ferenc, a West Bristol Middle School student, whose favorite hobby is ice skating, owns a dog named Rudy and can speak three languages -- English, Spanish and Polish.</p>

<p>The creator of the second image, with the state of Connecticut and the Bristol logo inside its boundaries, is Michael Pinette, a West Bristol Elementary School student, whose favorite hobby is fishing--he won this year's Perry J. Spinelli Fishing Derby partnering with a friend -- and who likes going outside but also likes playing video games.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
