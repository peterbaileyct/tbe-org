<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Resolution proposed for Mayor Caggiano and Police Chief Gould to sign</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Bristol community activists Adam Antar and Camelia Lopez met with Mayor Jeff Caggiano, Chief of Police Brian Gould, and the leadership from the Bristol NAACP to discuss the city’s response to the dispersement of racist propaganda that occurred in early June in the city. Cornel Lewis, long-time Hartford activist, was also in attendance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting came at the request of Mr. Antar and Ms. Lopez, who originally broached the subject at the June City Council meeting. At the beginning of the meeting the two young activists tried to express to the city leaders and the leaders of the NAACP that whatever had been tried in the past was not effective enough.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group met at the mayor's temporary office at 150 Main St.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NAACP local chapter Vice President Tim Camerl stated that after the incident in June occurred, the chapter called for a meeting and only one person showed up. Ms. Lopez asked how the meeting was announced and was told it was announced by letters and through the media. Her answer was that almost no person younger than 40 reads a newspaper or watches the news on TV anymore. Instead, she said they get their information over social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Her point was that a different approach is needed.</p>

<p>The police chief and the mayor pointed out that Bristol has made efforts to address issues on race and diversity with community conversations, but both Ms. Lopez and Mr. Antar insisted that more needed to be done, by getting the message out more effectively and at more frequent community events. Ms. Lopez said, "We need more right now. With what's happening in this country right now, this needs to be an ongoing public conversation with everyone showing that we are united."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Lewis supported Ms. Lopez's arguments with a quote from W.B. Dubois, who said, "Eastward and westward great winds are blowing; great, ugly whirlwinds of hatred, of blood, and of cruelty." Mr. Lewis continued in his own words, "These people are dangerous. They are not to be misunderstood or underestimated. ... This has to be nipped in the bud and we need all hands-on deck because if not, we're all going to suffer."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chief Gould updated the group on the police investigation of the incident, which he said is ongoing. Gould stated, "We have communicated with the Connecticut State Police as well as the FBI as well as other towns." He pointed out that the same incident has happened in numerous area towns, including Enfield, New Britain, East and West Hartford, and Southington. He said, "So, yes, the Feds and the state and locals are all trying to collaborate and share resources in trying to find out who dumped this stuff in our communities, but, as far as I know, there has not been a suspect or suspects identified yet."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One positive proposal that Mr. Antar hoped could have been accomplished on Tuesday afternoon was a suggested resolution that everyone in the meeting could agree on, sign, and release to the public. The suggested resolution, authored by Mr. Shaddad, reads:</p>

<p>Every person in the room was in agreement on the sentiments of the resolution. Mayor Caggiano stated that he might like to make a few small changes and that he needed to have it looked over by the Corporation Counsel and then ratified by the City Council for  the resolution to be adopted as an official city proclamation. The City Council meets next Tuesday, July 12, at 7 p.m..</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor agreed to meet again with the principals shortly after next week's council meeting.</p>

<p><em>Correction: Mr. Antar was incorrectly identified in an earlier version of the story. In addition, Mr. Camerl was incorrectly identified as the president of the local NAACP chapter. He assumes the presidency upon the resignation of the current president effective July 12. </em></p>
