<p>The Bristol Bazaar saw a remarkable turnout from the community for their first ever Pups &amp; Pumpkins Festival. The event held on Saturday combined furry friends and fall festivities in an artistic atmosphere.</p>

<p>"We're very, very grateful to everyone who came here today," said Bristol Bazaar Co- Owner Care Verikas. "We're just blown away by all the support."</p>

<p>The festival offered a wide array of activities to keep attendees engaged and entertained throughout the day, including holiday shopping and Halloween bingo. The highlight of the day was the dog adoption event, where many pups of all ages from Dog Star Rescue found their forever homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verikas, who had been looking forward to hosting the dog adoption event, ended up adding a new member to her family as well.</p>

<p>“We participated,” Verikas said. “We just fell in love with this sweet girl. Tootsie is 9 months old, and she'll be here at the Bazaar with me. We weren't planning on participating, but we just love animals. We have 5 cats and 2 dogs at home.”</p>

<p>For those who didn't leave with a furry friend of their own, the festival offered the opportunity to visit K-9 Frankie, who attended with Officer Alysha Pirog.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The interior of the Bristol Bazaar was adorned with decorative pumpkins and maple leaves. The community had the opportunity to handpick their perfect pumpkin from the 200 available, and those with a creative streak could decorate and paint their sugar pumpkins.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We hope to host more events like this in the future," Verikas said. "We're just so thankful to everyone who came."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Bazaar is currently home to over 50 vendors selling their wares in intricately designed displays and storefronts. Among the locally made products available for purchase are handmade jewelry, candles, soaps, signs, and delicious baked goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
