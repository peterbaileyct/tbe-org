<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fourth of July, 1903</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The usual ka-booms and bangs associated with July Fourth will be heard tonight. However, in Bristol, nothing in the history of July Fourth can compare to the Fourth of July of 1903, because it had everything: explosions, gunfire, cannon blasts, the infringement of Second Amendment rights, and general chaos. Without a doubt, it’s one for the record books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shortly after midnight, a building on a hill north of town owned by Patrick Coleman was blown to bits by dynamite. The explosion shook the area and raised almost everyone with a pulse out of bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A half-hour later, it sounded like a warzone. A series of what were described as “several hundred bombs" exploded west of the passenger train station. Whoever was asleep was now awake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 1 a.m., several boys entered the church on the south side of town and began ringing the church bell. The bell ringers were quickly taken into custody, but the town was now wide awake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if that was not enough, at 4 p.m., Leroy Greeno and Charles Blakesley fired a cannon on Divinity Street. At one point, the cannon had a delayed discharge resulting in injuries to the young men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, the usual assortment of accidents and random gunfire, including shots fired on Main Street that nearly struck Jessie Funck. Captain Belden (later chief) chased the gunmen, but he ducked into a house so crowded that the captain could not find him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so much gunfire during the day, the police began confiscating pistols “from all the young fellows that had them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enjoy the Fourth of July today, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
