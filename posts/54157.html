<p>A local family is asking for the public's help in locating their beloved dog, Max, who has been missing since late October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max, a 5-year-old cream-colored toy poodle, was last seen on the evening of Oct. 24, 2024 around Davis Drive. Max's owner, Michael Arashinko,  believes the dog may have been given away or sold to someone living in the immediate area. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max has a freshly groomed short coat and is known for his friendly, affectionate nature. Arashinko described his dog as a sociable companion who loves interacting with people. His young son, Alex, has been especially heartbroken by Max’s disappearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Max is super friendly," Arashinko said. "He loves people and he’s a great dog. My son really misses him. Max loves to boop his nose against yours.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max’s family is hoping that with the help of the community, their cherished companion will be safely returned home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Desmond’s Army Animal Law Advocates has stepped forward to offer a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for Max’s disappearance. In addition, Army’s Legacy Animal Rescue And Sanctuary, Inc. has pledged an additional $500, bringing the total reward to $5,500.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Arashinko remains hopeful, he is asking anyone who may spot Max not to approach or call out to him. He urges people to avoid chasing the dog and to instead reach out to authorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone with information on Max's whereabouts is urged to contact Arashinko directly at 412-910-5277 or Bristol Animal Control at 860-584-3087.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I hope someone has him and he’s alive, and he’ll come home soon,” Arashinko said.</p>
