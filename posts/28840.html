<p>The Bristol Blues (15-15-3) who are 4-3-3 in their last ten games, played their second game against Ocean State (16-19-1) this season. They have now split both games, with both teams winning by one run in their wins.</p>

<p>The Blues came into this game with an opportunity to take first place in the West Division. Jagger Duquette (2-0) started the game for the Blues. After allowing a solo home run in the first inning, Duquette settled in, facing 25 batters in six innings with two strikeouts and not allowing another run. He received relief from Aaron Zenus, Tommy Hughes, and Peter Phillips, who all pitched one inning.</p>

<p>Coming off a scoreless game, the Blues bats came alive in the fourth inning, when first baseman Cal Parrillo came up with runners on first and second, driving in Skye Selinsky on a single to right field to tie the game at 1-1. Parrillo finished the game 1 for 3, driving in the lone Blues run and hitting his 16th RBI of the season.</p>

<p>The game stayed tied until the seventh inning, when Jack Brooks walked and stole second. With two outs, David Mershon drove in his second RBI of the game and ninth of the season with a single to right field. Mershon was 3 for 4 in this game and gave enough support to his pitching to win the game.</p>

<p>The Blues left eight on base and left players in scoring position in four different innings but could not drive them in. Even having the bases loaded in the seventh. Ocean State's starter, Wyatt Lunsford-Shenkman (2-0), had his most strikeouts in a game this season while only allowing one run in five innings. Parker Bard and Aaron Groller both relieved an inning for OceanState, and Austin Wainer finished the last two innings without allowing a run and collecting his fourth save of the season.</p>

<p>After this loss, the Blues look to bounce back in their next game on Thursday at 8 p.m. against the Keene Swamp Bats (12-23-0) whom they beat twice earlier in the season.</p>
