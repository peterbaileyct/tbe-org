<p>Joseph V. Maggipinto, 90, of Bristol, Conn., and Harwich, Mass., husband of the late Anne (Graham) Maggipinto, passed away peacefully on Monday, Aug. 29. Joe was born in Bristol on Sept. 24, 1931, the son of Peter and Della (Donata) Borrelli Maggipinto. He was predeceased by his sister, Donata Hughes. </p>

<p>A lifelong Bristol resident, Joe graduated from Bristol High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the University of Connecticut, a Master of Education from the University of Hartford, and a Master of Science Degree from Central Connecticut State University. After serving with the United States Army in Germany for which he earned the Wartime Service Medal for the Korean conflict, Joe returned to Bristol and became a dedicated educator. </p>

<p>He began his career at South Side School and then went on to Greene-Hills School where he met his wife, Anne. Joe then served as principal at Ellen P. Hubbell School and Louis Toffolon School where he positively touched the lives of many teachers and students (and let his daughters play “teacher” in empty classrooms while he worked in his office on the weekends). </p>

<p>Joe was affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America. He was a National Guardsman. He spent many winter weekends with friends and family skiing at his beloved Round Top Mountain in Vermont in the winter and enjoying summers on the Cape (steamers for everybody!). Nothing compared to the time he spent with his grandchildren, though. </p>

<p>Joe is survived by his four daughters (aka the 4 Ds): Donata Maggipinto Reeser and husband, Courtney, Deidre Tavera and husband, Frank, Diane Maggipinto Maffly and husband, Brian, and Dina Maggipinto Troupe and husband, George. Joe was the beloved grandfather of Chance (Tanya) Reeser and Reynard Reeser, Katharine Tavera (Sean) Collins, Evan and Emma Tavera, Aryana and Emilio Maffly. He was also the great grandfather of Giovanni Collins, and Elle and Jones Reeser. Joe was a loving uncle and cousin as well as a cherished friend to many. There’s a reason he was called “the mayor.”</p>
