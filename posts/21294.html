<p>Wheeler had special praise for the Bristol businesses and individuals who were honored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Barnes Group Foundation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Barnes Group and Barnes Group Foundation share a 50+-history with Wheeler. In January 1968, Bonnie Barnes became the secretary of the first Board of Trustees of Wheeler &nbsp;and offered considerable pro bono legal work to help establish the organization from the estate of Bertha Wheeler. Since then, Tom Barnes, the Barnes family, and the Barnes Group Foundation have been an integral part of Wheeler services and growth, playing invaluable roles as advisors, supporters, leaders, and friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most recently, in the summer 2021, as Wheeler finalized plans to build a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wheelerclinic.org/news/wheeler-health-purchase-centre-square-property-flagship-health-center-and-corporate-headquarters-500000-fundraising-campaign-ann" target="_blank">community health center at One Hope Street</a>&nbsp;in Centre Square in downtown Bristol, Tom and the Barnes Group Foundation became the project’s lead donor, committing a $100,000 pledge toward the $500,000 campaign goal. This contribution helped spur community support for the vision in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>ESPN</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past summer and fall, the Production Operations team of ESPN worked with Together We Rise, a national non-profit organization, to do something kind for local youth in foster care. The team assembled and donated 60 skateboards, as well as helmets, and decorated bags containing items of comfort for children in Wheeler’s foster care program. Foster care is a priority area for Disney and ESPN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Jim and Janet Moylan</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jim Moylan served on Wheeler’s Board of Trustees for nearly a decade and was board chair for the past three. Jim possesses a deep knowledge in health care, and for 30 years, served in financial leadership positions in hospitals across Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jim is a champion of operations and quality, as well as board growth and diversity. He has shaped Wheeler in ways that will be felt for decades to come. Most recently, Jim and his wife, Janet, made the lead gift in the Board of Trustees’ $100,000 goal for the Bristol community health center campaign. They also have supported Wheeler’s Golf Classic at a leadership level for many years.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
