<p>The public has been actively involved in the process, beginning with an initial public input meeting on March 8, followed by a community walk audit on April 20. At Wednesday's meeting, NVCOG will present the results of a community survey that was conducted to solicit feedback from residents.</p>

<p>The Bristol Trail Study began in January of this year, with the goal of determining the best routing options to provide a safe, continuous connection between Rockwell Park in the west to Downtown, continuing east to Route 229. </p>

<p>On Monday, The City of Bristol was received $320,000 from the state to advance the NVCOG concept into design. The award is part of a statewide initiative by Gov. Ned Lamont and Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
