<p>Patrick Conlin will never forget one of his first visits to a Boys and Girls Club. The president of Wayback Burger was then with another national sandwich company at the time, serving turkey sandwiches the day before Thanksgiving. This was 20, if not 30, years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We brought turkey sandwiches, and there were young kids like we saw today, and before we left, one of the kids came up to me and said, "Mister, Mister, that was the best food that I've had in a long time.' I will never forget it. It just tugged at your heart. That was probably 20, 30 years ago, and I will never forget that."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conlin was the honored guest at the first "Faces of the Future Breakfast" sponsored by the Bristol Boys and Girls Club on Thursday last week. Wayback reached a giving milestone, having reached $1 million over the last five years to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the Bristol club presented Conlin with a plaque recognizing Wayback for its contribution.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, with Wayback Burgers corporate headquarters in Cheshire, the company and the Bristol location have been developing their own relationship. Conlin already volunteers with the annual golf tournament fundraiser and visits the Bristol location a couple of times a year, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We look to get involved in things we can do with the kids with our office," Conlin said. "We are talking about doing some workforce training, not just working a restaurant but all the different avenues that you have from the restaurant to a corporate office to a food service distributor, so there are a lot of career paths that are available, and we'd like to help with that."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Right now, the relationship is in the beginning stages," said Jay Maia, president and CEO of the BBGC. "It will be a great program."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The breakfast, which will be held every third Thursday from 8 to 9:30 a.m., is a new initiative and offers an opportunity to meet young club members, learn about programming from club staff and network with businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several businesses were represented at the first breakfast, including Covanta, Tracy-Driscoll Insurance, Positano Plumbing and Posner, Henderson &amp; Goslee Dentistry. The breakfast was donated by Jimmy's on the River, donuts and coffee from Dunkin Donuts and bagels from Fancy Bagels, the first two from Bristol and the latter from Farmington, respectively. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for the breakfasts, Maia said it's a great way for a business to come in and network with other businesses, network with staff and socialize, have breakfast on the club and hear from the kids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also a way to let businesses and the community know that the club has under its umbrella Imagine Nation and Future Champions Gymnastics, as well as outreach at Cambridge Park and before and after school programs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for hearing from youth members, several shared their thoughts about what the club means to them before the food was served.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Terrence Love, a student at Chippens Hill Middle school, said he loves the programs, because they show that there are two sides to struggle, and one is developing strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It helps me be passionate about the things I love most, and one of those things is all the kind and loving people that came here today," he said. Love presented the plaque of appreciation to Conlin later in the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Annika Boebel, Northeast Middle School, who has been coming to the club for seven years, said she loves the programs, like cooking, and being a member of Torch Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I love going the club because we get to do homework," she said, "and seeing all the staff and doing all the field trips and all the sports."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her brother Christian Boebel, also a student at Northeast Middle School, loves coming to the club where he participates in programs, such as "Passport to Manhood" and sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's all about being a better person," he said of the programs, and added, "I really love the staff because if you ever need help, they will always be there for you."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern student Jonathan Roscoe, said "The one thing I like about the Boys and Girls Club is I get to meet new people and find new opportunities."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast Middle School student Jordan Mejia said he loves how he can express his feelings because he knows he is among friends and can have input into "new ideas for activities."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the students addressed the group, Maia said, "Here they are. It takes a village, that is the one of the reasons you are here today. To meet our kids, make friends, cultivate relationships and anything that you can to support us today or in the future."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
