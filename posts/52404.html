<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central girls finished the regular season at 7-7 in the CCC South. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Tamara Stafford stated, “I am over the moon about the progress of this team. Our only seasoned and number&nbsp;two runner suffered an injury early on, so a young/new team had to step up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Led by sophomore and number one runner, Emersyn Mazzini, the Rams improved remarkably since the beginning of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford continued, “I am honored to coach a group of young ladies who fought for themselves and one another. They had to build the confidence to run in a varsity race on the biggest stage, Wickham Park, and they did just that.”</p>

<p>To sum up the season, Stafford said, “BCXC has a legacy of excellence and I believe that continued this year. Excellence cannot be measured in wins and losses only. Progress, determination, and trust were all things our team achieved throughout the season. Because of that, we will come back stronger to finish the season and especially next season.”</p>
