<p>BRISTOL -&nbsp;The Bristol girls soccer team finally got to the pay window last Thursday as the Lancers picked off Hartford Public by a 6-0 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters moved to 1-3-1 with its victory while the Owls fell to 0-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had a good week, going 1-1-1 and made a great showing against Portland over a losing effort in the previous match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But against Public, Eastern zipped up a 4-0 cushion by the half and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers outshot the Owls 30-0 overall while Eastern maintained that edge with shots on goal (17-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense fueled the day as Eastern keeper Hailey Beebe wasn’t shot against, leading to a clean sheet while Public goalie Maria Padilla was under fire throughout but still managed to stop 11 shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[She] played great in goal for Hartford Public,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman of Padilla.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just two minutes into match play, the Lancers had already won the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Perrone stole a pass in the box and smashed it in the goal to give Eastern a quick 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eighteen minutes later, Eastern forward Megan Krok was up to her usual offensive tricks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Perrone found Krok for a nice give and go play that led to a goal and a 2-0 lead a quarter way into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with 12 minutes left before the half, Mya McCallop scored her first ever goal as the home team squared up a 3-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Mya McCallop receives a great pass from Emma Stavens to score her first career goal,” said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Stavens did a little scoring of her own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 34-minute mark of the match, on an Eastern corner kick, Krok found Stavens for the fourth tally of the first half as the Lancers were in complete control at 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a three-minute stretch midway through the second period, Katie Patterson and Alaina Joy kicked in goals to stretch the advantage out to 6-0 - the final score of the affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kate Patterson found the ball at her feet after a broken-up corner kick play and didn’t miss the opportunity,” said Redman. “And Alaina Joy received a great pass from Mya McCallop for her first career goal and Mya's first career assist.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big win for Eastern, Redman and company and the squad hopes to make it two in a row when the Lancers square off against Platt on Tuesday at 3:45 from Alumni Field.&nbsp;</p>
