<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ken Krawiec was playing<br>
tennis with some friends Wednesday night at Page Park, when he heard a sudden<br>
burst of gunfire. "The shots came quickly, pop, pop, pop, about twelve in<br>
a row," said Krawiec. Then there was a pause of ten to fifteen seconds and<br>
another burst of gunfire erupted, another 10-12 shots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The next thing Krawiec<br>
heard was the sound of sirens everywhere. He got in his car and followed the<br>
parade of emergency vehicles heading to Redstone Hill Road. As he drove down<br>
Middle Street, he came to the ESPN North campus, and in the parking lot there<br>
already appeared to be around twenty police cars parked in the lot, with<br>
officers everywhere. He finally got as close as the intersection of Metro<br>
Street and Redstone, and from there everything was blocked off. While he was<br>
watching, the State Police Crime Lab van arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">What Krawiec heard was<br>
something we think couldn't happen in our hometown. Two young police officers<br>
were killed and one wounded in what the state police have called a deliberate<br>
ambush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
