<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team was looking to get off the snide on Thursday afternoon, opening its slate of home matches with a CCC South showdown against a very good Lewis Mills program from Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers never got any traction going at the event as the locals fell by a 5-0 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills (2-1) had several good chances at the Eastern net but were still stopped numerous times by keeper Hailey Beebe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She stopped shot after shot but was under fire for most of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beebe scooped up a season-high 13 saves for the Kingstreeters but the squad was overwhelmed by the Spartan’s offense in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Burlington’s Lily Castle, a bit of a goal scoring machine, notched two scores for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heather Delbone, Payton Hallet and Layla Ljubuncic all tallied goals in the second win of the campaign for Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spartans’ keeper Anna Henry added two saves for the visiting program as the Lancers fell to 0-2 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will be looking for its first goal of the season when the squad travels to East Hartford on Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 3:45 p.m. before Eastern plays three straight matches from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, non-conference challenger Portland (4:30 p.m.) comes to Alumni Field in Bristol while on Thursday, Hartford Public (3:45 p.m.) is in town for a CCC bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Portland enters its match against Eastern undefeated at 2-0-2 while Public, as of Sunday, had yet to play a game this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have a very good chance to get to the pay window this coming week.</p>
