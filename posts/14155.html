<p>One vendor stood out on the opening day of the 2022 Bristol Farmers Market season yesterday; not because they had a fancy painted food truck [it was inconspicuous], but because the theme for their popular smoothies were inspired by the Netflix show, <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>.</p>

<p>Kalidia Reyes, 40, leads an all-female operated business. Although she was not present that day, her husband Jeffrey Arias was there in her place serving a variety of smoothies from The Mana Palace food truck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“During the pandemic, we were stuck at home and our kids kept asking for McDonald's, stuff like that,” said Arias. “After watching The Queen's Gambit, it inspired us to name every drink after chess pieces in combination with trying to make something healthier for the kids.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With names like Queen, Bishop and Rook, the tropical and berry flavored smoothies were more than just checkmate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 40-year-old Arias said they originally started the business serving food in 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just couldn't keep up with the business so we thought we have to simplify and make is easier for anyone,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the busy couple have fulltime jobs working in production at ESPN, they just started a second business -- renting out bouncy houses for parties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We started with three, and we can do a package,” said Arias. “We’ll send a bouncy house, and we’ll include a free snow cone machine or a cotton candy machine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They send someone to help with birthday parties, and sometimes attend to make smoothies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As if the couple aren’t busy enough, they also started a chess club at St. Joseph <a href="https://stjosephbristol.org/school">School</a> which runs every month.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We tie it all together -- the whole concept of The Mana Palace is to promote physical and mental health,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arias said he and his wife feel that chess is a good game to play which can help develop a person’s mindset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In true entrepreneurial spirit, they are a couple with a plan. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They hope that more people will join their chess club, which can bring families together, all while juggling two businesses and promoting a healthier lifestyle.</p>
