<p>The number of stories covering the scandal brewing around Kosta Diamantis, one-time state representative from the 79th District, continues to grow. For instance, CT Mirror has over&nbsp;20 stories, including state reports, one of which numbers 497 pages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here at TBE, we do not have the resources of CT Mirror, but we do think is it important to cover the story. Aside from representing Bristol in the General Assembly, Diamantis allegedly tried to influence contracts here in Bristol between the city and concerns working on the Memorial Boulevard Intradistrict Magnet Arts School.&nbsp;</p>
