<p>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. - Maybe the ultimate ending at the Myrtle Beach Bowl didn’t go the way the football program from UConn had envisioned it on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Huskies gave Marshall a late scare, falling by a 28-14 final from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</p>

<p>UConn (6-7) was shutout through two-and-a-half quarters of action before its running game came alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Bristol Central standout Victor Rosa scored two touchdowns over a four-plus minute stretch of the third quarter as the locals battled into the fourth with a little momentum, trailing by just two scores.</p>

<p>Rosa led the ground attack for UConn with 16 rushes for 75 yards.</p>

<p>The speedster ended his freshman campaign with TD carries of 14 and 24 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first score came off a dash that saw Rosa make a quick cut left and simply outrace the pack as his 14-yard jaunt got UConn on the board with 5:35 left to play in the third tilt (28-7).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second touchdown saw the freshman from Bristol sprint through a crowd and find a hole on the left side. With the 24-yard dash at the third period buzzer, Rosa tallied his 11th TD of the season, and the Huskies were barking - trimming the deficit in half at 28-14 with twelve minutes to go.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Marshall (9-4) forced UConn into a 4th-and-13 situation it could not complete over its first drive of the fourth quarter, and with 5:09 left to go, QB Zion Turner was picked off in the end zone to end the final drive of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa made 16 of UConn’s 38 total carries, also bringing back one kickoff return for 24 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 140 rushing attempts this season, Rosa has complied 636 yards and 11 TDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies finished the campaign at 6-7 overall and, with some help from Rosa, the UConn football program is back on the collegiate map in 2022.</p>
