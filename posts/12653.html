<p>BRISTOL - With head coach Tyler Catlin welcoming a brand-new baby into the world, the Bristol Eastern softball team gave its first-year coach a great gift for the newborn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that was a big victory over Conard last Friday in a Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern assistant coach Rico Lodovico won his first varsity game as the Lancers downed Conard by an 11-4 final from the Thunderdome in Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne helped Eastern get to the pay window, dropping in a three-run homer to pace the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ali Tellier was clutch from the start for the Lancers from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier went for a ‘hat trick’ as she belted out three home runs, giving the Lancers a sizable edge in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 4-3 on the season.</p>
