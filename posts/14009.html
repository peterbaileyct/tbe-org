<p>The overwhelming St. Paul march to the Class S state championship finished the way it had to, with another tremendous pitching performance and a balanced offensive output that left no doubt the Falcons are one of the best baseball teams in Connecticut. There is a very strong argument that they are the #1 team in the state, regardless of division.</p>

<p>Joey Tonnotti tossed another gem to lead the Falcons to a 5-0 win in the Class S State Championship game Saturday afternoon at Palmer Field in Kiddletown. Tonnotti allowed just 2 singles while striking out 10 to pick up his 12th win of the season with no losses. Tonnotti had at least 1 stikeout in every inning, and did not allow a single baserunner to reach third. Kaede Wood tossed a complete game and took the loss for Somers.</p>

<p>After Tonnotti retired the side in order to start the game, the St. Paul offense put three runs on the board in the bottom of the first to capture the early lead. </p>

<p>Devin Kulas led off with a ground rule double, and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Ryan Daniels singled Kulas home to make it 1-0. Then Mario Izzo doubled into the right center gap allowing Daniels to score from 1st. Izzo scored on Tonnotti's RBI single, and St Paul led 3-0 after one inning.</p>

<p>Both pitchers were in control in the 2nd inning as neither team was able to get a hit or score.</p>

<p>Troy Maia led off in the top of the 3rd, and grounded a single through the left side of the infield for Somers' first hit and baserunner. Catcher Casey Cerruto gunned down Maia attempting to steal for the first out, and Somers was unable to score.</p>

<p>All of the scoring for the rest of the game came in the bottom of the 4th inning. With one out, Cal Chance singled. Then with two out, Ryan Daniels drove a 3-0 pitch into the right field bleachers to give the Falcons the 5-0 lead.</p>

<p>Colby McCormick had an infield single for Somers in the top of the 5th, and that was the last hit that Tonnotti gave up on the day.</p>

<p>The victory on Saturday completed a five game rampage through the tournament in which St. Paul outscored their five opponents by a combined score of 55-3, an amazing display of overpowering pitching, great defense, and explosive offensive firepower. <br><br>St. Paul’s march to the Class S crown started with a 22-0 win over Terryville. Then came the Falcons’ one nail-biter, a 3-1 win in extra innings over St. Bernard. After that, St. Paul cruised,  with an 18-2 crushing of North Branford in the quarterfinals and a 7-0 shutout of Immaculate in the semis.</p>
