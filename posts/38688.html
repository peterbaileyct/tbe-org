<p>The inaugural meeting of the local celebration of the 250th anniversary of the country drew almost two dozen people from different groups to the Bristol Historical Society last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's a start," said Lee McFadden, state vice regent of the Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution and America 250 state chair, who organized and led the meeting. "That's the important thing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McFadden was very happy with the turnout for the first meeting, she said, and she hopes more people will join the next time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The next steps will include continued brainstorming about what activities would appeal to our community and to begin to set up committees for public relations and for the schools," she said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I feel confident Bristol will have meaningful and fun celebrations for our country's 250th anniversary."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McFadden is also the chair and site manager for the Gov. Jonathan Trumbull House in Lebanon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants included residents interested in the planning of the anniversary, representatives from the Bristol Public Library and Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services as well as those from the Bristol Historical Society, Bristol Military Museum and American Clock and Watch Museum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants brainstormed ideas from the types of stories they would like to collect to how to expand the planning to include people from more diverse backgrounds. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 250th anniversary will be celebrated on July 4, 2026, but the conversation on Thursday included a conversation about events that would span the anniversary year. While the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services was included in the discussion, the city is not officially associated with planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McFadden asked participants to think about the topics raised during the conversation as well as new ones for next time meeting and encouraged people to reach out to other groups and individuals to come to join the group on Thursday, Jan. 18 at 6:30 p.m. at the historical society.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
