<p>Football conditioning started on the scholastic level this past week and that means a lot of time out on the field and in the hot sun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players will be out and about on the hot turf and must be wary of something called ‘Exertional Heat Illness.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has specific guidelines on what exertional heat illness is, the signs and symptoms, and the treatment for such afflictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August has been known for extreme heat and this year, the month isn’t an exception to the rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if you aren’t playing sports, perhaps mowing the lawn, gardening, or getting dunked on by your five-year-old in the backyard (hey, it happens), knowing the signs of heat illness - and what to do in terms of first aid - could help save someone a trip to the hospital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a release from the CIAC, there are four types of exertional heat illness and several ways to treat it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Heat Cramps</strong> - This can include cramping of legs, arms, and abdomen contraction which can be extremely painful.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Resting, consuming fluids, and even a little stretching can prevent that type of cramping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li><strong>Heat Syncope</strong> - It’s a form of fainting due to poor blood flow in a hot environment, causing one to lose consciousness.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Find a cool, shady spot while elevating the athletes’ legs. Elevating the legs helps with blood flow and cools the body in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3"><li><strong>Heat Exhaustion</strong> - It occurs when exercising or competing in heat which causes cardiovascular insufficiency and energy depletion. It’s the most common form of heat related condition and may not be associated with a physical collapse. Headache, dizziness, vomiting, weakness, and a rapid heartbeat are symptoms of this affliction.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: Most of the treatments from heat syncope apply here. Ice bags and fluid intake can also help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4"><li><strong>Heat Stroke</strong> - This condition, also called EHS (Exertional Heat Stroke) is extremely dangerous. The temperature of an individual with EHS could reach as high as 105. And as the body’s temperature rises, the individual cannot cool off naturally. Nausea or vomiting along with quick breathing and low blood pressure are symptoms. Organ damage can also occur along with central nervous system breakdowns. Immediate first aid is necessary for this condition and could lead to death if not properly treated.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Treatment</strong>: This is where an ice bath would be of tremendous help. If outside, a shady spot and wet towels also would be helpful to cool the body down. Getting the fever down to a treatable level is the key.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Drink, drink, drink</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when an athlete isn’t showing signs of EHS, fluid consumption is a great way to stay safe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Water, Gatorade, and the like need to be consumed in copious amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many times do you see an athlete fall to cramping on a beautiful 75-degree day?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consumption of fluids is a must.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Athletes must know the signs and symptoms of EHS and what to do to prevent those types of afflictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coaches also need to be concerned about heat related illnesses over the start of Indian summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those players want to get back on the field as soon as possible and, since it’s early in preseason, there’s no rush to send an athlete back into practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heat cramps can be treated quickly but in other cases, shutting an athlete down for a time is always a wise precaution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coaches know the signs of heat related illnesses, along with certified athletic trainers, and are there to help a stricken athlete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those mentors aren’t going to rush players back on the field after suffering from the heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to understand that heat related illness is real and there’s plenty of necessary treatment available to help an athlete in distress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August is preparation time while September begins the regular season for scholastic athletes so it’s prudent to be careful in the preseason when the summer sun is still in full blast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have fun competing on the fields but please, make sure to know the signs of ‘Exertional Heat Illness’ and how to treat it.</p>
