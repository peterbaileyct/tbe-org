<p>The Bristol Central girls soccer team has already put together a very good campaign - winning its first three matches while carrying a slick 4-3 ledger overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after dropping tough contests to Enfield and Maloney over a three-day stretch last week, the Rams put together a tremendous effort against Platt on Tuesday, September 27 from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central blasted Platt for a season high nine goals as the Panthers fell 9-0 in a CCC South engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams entered the contest with 11 goals and then nearly doubled that tally after the showdown against Platt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everyone got into the offensive flow for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several players nabbed two goals against Platt as Rachel Wygant, Beccy Litwinczyk, and Gigi Pena led the offensive charge while Maggie Palamar, Emily Lowe, and Sophia Dalipi all added one tally apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicole Reimer passed off two assists while the grouping of Abby Hansen, Ava Bouchard, Palamar, Wygant and Dalipi all added an assist to the outstanding scoring effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Maddy Corcoran didn’t have to sweat too much as she earned the shutout and scooped in one save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the fourth victory of the season for Central as the program is looking to be a contender come the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams opened the year on fire, posting wins against the likes of Middletown, Plainville and Conard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central had to engineer two tremendous come-from-behind efforts to earn those wins, proving that when this squad is down on the scoreboard, it's never truly out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s one of the marks of a fine team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how those three victories went down over the first half of September for the Rams:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, September 8 - Bristol Central 3, Middletown 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of those amazing come from behind efforts came against Middletown as the Blue Dragons scored nearly off the bat, forcing the Rams to play catch-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a goal going into the second forty, Wygant found Hansen for a quick header to tie the event up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moments later, Wygant was in a giving mood again, this time finding Palamar for a score and quickly, the go-ahead goal made it 2-1 in Central’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant then helped her team with one final tally as her corner kick found the feet of Lowe for another score - leading to the Rams hard-fought two-goal victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tuesday, September 13 - Bristol Central 3, Plainville 0</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant was at it again, scoring twice to keep pesky Plainville at bay over a three-goal romp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams also saw Dalipi notch a goal via a free kick as the locals won for the second straight time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio of Mikayla Holland, Hansen, and Bouchard helped the offense along as Central won big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corcoran was clutch in goal, earning her first shutout of the campaign, as the Blue Devils just made three shots on goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The back line of Roy, Duval, and Lowe all helped to keep their keeper perfect that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thursday, September 15 - Bristol Central 2, Conard 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams trailed 1-0 going into the second forty but scored twice to seize a huge victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, Wygant had another complete game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scored both goals to get the Rams win number three of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit to the defense as the grouping of Lowe, Christina Brown, Roy and Duval all played well on the backline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Hansen, Abby Quintero, Dalipi and Bouchard were standouts on offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I couldn’t be more proud of these group of players,” said Bristol Central girls soccer Twitter feed. “This is basically the same team as last year. They came in with a new attitude, a drive, a desire to win [and] to be better than they were last year."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended this past week against East Catholic (6-1 overall) on Friday on the road in Manchester - falling by a 5-1 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles have won six straight matches - allowing just four total goals after getting bested by Tolland (5-0) to open the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that was a good test for Central to open the first week of October as its nearly city series time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dates against both Middletown and Bristol Eastern loom next week.</p>
