<p>It is no secret in Bristol that the Democratic Town Committee has been reeling since the smashing victory by Rich Kilby and his Republican horde in last November’s elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But lately, word has been surfacing that things were even worse than they seemed in the fall. In fact, five out of the six Democratic city council candidates discovered after the new year that even their spouses failed to vote for them. One disgruntled candidate who wanted to remain anonymous said, ”My husband told me he didn’t even realize there was an election that day. I guess we really did a poor job of getting our message out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that as the backdrop, the party tried to launch their comeback bid with a rousing monthly meeting held at Torries’ Den in Terryville. One of the committee members, who preferred to remain anonymous, said, ”We’ve been wandering in the wilderness since the last election, and when we reached Torries’ Den, we knew it would be perfect for our July meeting. It is remote enough that people can feel free to speak honestly about our problems, and yet it is big enough (capacity of 8), that it can hold all our supporters.”</p>

<p>“Since only one person can stand in the cave at one time, it was easy to see who held the floor,” stated one of the candidates who wanted to remain anonymous. ”It was the most orderly meeting I have ever attended.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Committee had a fire going inside the cave throughout the meeting, and following the example of the Catholic Church, the plan was to have white smoke rise up from the flue when they agreed on a candidate for the 78th House District.  Unfortunately, 56 hours elapsed and only black smoke flitted out from the cave. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the weary group emerged. When questioned about the lack of a white smoke signal, the chairman, who preferred to remain anonymous, replied, ”Not a single person volunteered to lose.” When the follow-up question queried why the Dems ended the meeting without naming a candidate, he could only say, ”We ran out of firewood.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was some optimism after the meeting, however, as word emerged that a big group was expected for the August meeting, and the committee arranged to reserve a phone booth in Forestville for the event. They are aiming for a Nov. 14 launch of the fall campaign.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
