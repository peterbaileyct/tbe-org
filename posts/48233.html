<p>Wheeler Health has been designated a 2024 Top Workplaces Industry winner for healthcare through a process conducted by Energage, a purpose-driven organization that develops solutions to build and brand Top Workplaces, Wheeler announced in a release yesterday.</p>

<p>For 17 years, the Top Workplaces program has surveyed and celebrated people-first organizations nationally and across 60 regional markets. Its industry award program acknowledges organizations for people-first workplace cultures with a specific sector.</p>

<p>The award marks winners as employers of choice for those seeking employment in the industry. Top Workplaces awards are based on feedback from a research-backed employee engagement survey.</p>

<p>"This recognition is a testament to our collective efforts in cultivating an exceptional workplace culture, built on our solid foundation of organizational values," said Sabrina Trocchi, PhD, MPA, president and chief executive officer, Wheeler, in the release. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
