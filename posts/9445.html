<p>Everyone is celebrating the fact that the CIAC finally held its championship weekend for boys and girls soccer, volleyball, swimming and field hockey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was great to see because the pandemic knocked out the championships in 2020 and the student athletes have long awaited the chance to compete for titles in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that being said, I was absolutely appalled to see the girls soccer championship results from Saturday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the squads from Bristol didn’t qualify and I was out of the state so I had just a passing interest in the results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when I finally hit the CIAC website, and saw the scores from the Class LL and Class M championship matches, you could hear me yelling from Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s because <em>both </em>matches ended up in 0-0 ties?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come on!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staples and Wilton went 0-0 in the Class LL bout while in the Class M tilt, Mercy and Sacred Heart Academy did not have a score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CIAC, after a year off, couldn’t figure out how to deal with championship stalemates?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t understand it and I certainly don’t like co-champions at the state title level - in anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s completely ridiculous and the solution to this issue is simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You play eighty hard fought minutes and the score is tied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then you put five minutes on the clock, twice, and if the match is still a stalemate, what do you do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take penalty kicks for crying out loud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is that so difficult?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What life lessons does a tie get you in the end?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this Little League? Does everyone get a trophy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine if the Bristol Eastern and Simsbury volleyball squads were in the midst of a hotly contested fifth and final set in the CCC Championship Tournament game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The score is 15-15 and you have to win the set by two points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would the scene look like if the set was still all tied up at 20-20 and the referee blew the whistle and said ‘that’s it. This match is a draw!’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How crazy would that be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who in their right mind would say, “Oh, fantastic! Everybody wins!’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How mad would both squads be with that outcome?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How could Bristol Eastern All-State middle/outside hitter Hannah Webber enjoy her postgame Cheez-It crackers after that tomfoolery?!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Believe me, a competitor like Webber - and most of those other student athletes from Saturday at Dillion Stadium in Hartford - don’t play for ties or stalemates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a winner and there’s a loser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a poor life lesson and just as silly a concept the times Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern football programs had to share the Battle for the Bell Trophy on two separate occasions over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, here’s the winner and here’s the loser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not, ‘hey it’s a tie - we all win! Hooray!’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give me a break…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of us in the media weren’t even aware that overtime wasn’t part of scholastic soccer in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year during the raging pandemic, it made sense to end games in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just getting the athletes a partial season was a big deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t understand who would vote for ties in soccer to continue instead of trying to determine an ultimate winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, McDonald’s will be open after the game - no matter when the match ends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the mechanics of penalty kicks could be modified - whether additional time is played or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s say after eighty grueling minutes, a soccer match is tied at 1-1 and two extra periods were played - leading to a continued stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go to penalty kicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or simply forget the two overtime sessions and go right to the kicks instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the first team to get a ball by the opposing keeper wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going from the end of regulation to the first penalty kick make wouldn’t take all that long, would it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But ties need to go away and state title games in Connecticut must have a winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Truly, no one wins when you have to split championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Play until someone wins because these outstanding athletes deserve a proper ending instead of what happed on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s only fair.</p>
