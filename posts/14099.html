<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Senior American Legion team has some very good talent to turn to this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Jerry LaPenta knows he has several players that can slip into multiple positions around the diamond and that versatility has always been a staple of Post 2’s baseball programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We have a nice balance and nice depth," said LaPenta of this year’s team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there’s an established crew in the Bristol lineup, LaPenta will also get support from four dual rostered players – guys that compete at both the Senior and Junior American Legion levels throughout the summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s a boatload of Bristol Eastern talent that will earn time on both squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Roalf (pitcher/shortstop), Ryan Maglio (pitcher/infield), Connor Cyr (IF/OF), and Rio Fernandez (catcher) are a talented foursome that can step up for some of those veteran players when the need arises.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those guys will get invaluable experience playing with the Senior crew and then turn around to help Junior’s coach Bill Mason keep his program successful as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over the first to zone games, those players have already been relatively busy, come off the pine to pinch-run or in starting assignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez was pressed into duty on Monday against West Hartford and did a credible job catching for Matt Beaucar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also has a stick to match at the plate and will continue to back up Chris Osuch at catcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I thought Rio played really well tonight for a sophomore," said LaPenta of Fernandez. "His swings are coming along...he's a big kid"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a good accounting at the plate against West Hartford and played pretty well during the scholastic campaign over at Eastern – under head coach Steve Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez had 10 hits for Eastern this year, walked 13 times, and added six RBI while&nbsp;Maglio was 3-4 from the mound, carrying a 4.20 ERA to go along with a team-leading 37 strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf’s ERA of 3.78 was just under the team average at Eastern, going 2-4 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He fanned 29 batters while Cyr was a tremendous batter for the Kingstreeters, posting a .349 average, roped up 15 hits, walked six times and was a slick 8-for-8 in the stolen base department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those players will be of immense help along the way in 2022 for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm happy with [Fernandez] and the other three guys we dual-rostered," said LaPenta. "They all are going to contribute."</p>
