<p>SOUTH WINDSOR - Bristol Eastern girls basketball coach Tony Floyd knew that sometime this season, freshman reserve Jayle Evins-Mosley was going to have a big game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, every person in and around the Eastern program has been waiting for such a contest from the first year forward/center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that game came to pass on Monday night in a CIAC Class L first round showdown against No. 14 South Windsor on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 19 Bristol Eastern pulled off a little March Madness - just a bit early in late February - as Evins-Mosley and the Kingstreeters pulled off a big 52-46 upset over the Bobcats to move on to second round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 11-11 overall while South Windsor ends its season at 13-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evins-Mosley was sensational off the bench, leading the squad with 14 points on slick 7-of-7 shooting while also scooping in three offensive rebounds - collecting six overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior sensation Taigan Parent blasted in three 3-pointers on her way to 13 points to go along with two assists and two steals while Autumn Udoh flashed in 12 points, six rebounds and a couple steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel added five points, a couple rebounds and two steals, Vanessa Drury nabbed four points, three rebounds and five assists while Lauren Ayotte grabbed a rebound along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And forward Leah Roy was simply tremendous as she hit her first jumper that led to a four-point, six-rebound, five-assist and two-steal effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s bench of Evins-Mosley and Noel combined to shoot 9-for-9 from the field while the Lancers shot 46.3-percent overall for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ defense stepped up over second-half play, limiting the Bobcats to just seven third period points as the visiting aggression never trailed over the final 13 minutes of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor’s Anna Matus led all players with 17 points while Olivia Petgrave and Reagan Heafey-DeAngelis each supplied 10 over the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy and Parent (three-pointer) nabbed back-to-back jumpers to open play but via the power of an 11-1 South Windsor burst - ended with a Heafey-DeAngelis lay-up - the home team led 11-6 with 3:05 left to play in the first tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evins-Mosley later put back a miss, then scored again off a Drury dish-off and when Parent found Roy for a lay-up to end the first frame scoring, Eastern trailed 15-12 but the squad was in contention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams traded baskets in the second stanza as Noel canned two hoops and when Drury found Parent for her second 3 of the game, Eastern had the deficit trimmed to 20-19 with 5:51 to go in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers never got the lead back before intermission and even as Udoh notched the final three points of the second, the Bobcats held a 25-22 push at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that lead didn’t last long as Eastern, with Evins-Mosley starting the third quarter, cued a 7-2 burst with two straight field goals, and when Udoh found Parent for her final 3 of the contest with 5:00 left in the frame, Eastern regained the edge at 29-27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The freshman duo of Evins-Mosley and Udoh scored the final five Eastern points of the third and with eight minutes remaining, the road warriors were holding on to a slight 34-32 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fourth period went back and forth though South Windsor - tying the game twice over the final minutes - never truly got over the hump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matus canned a 3 and later drilled two free throws and with 5:00 to go, the contest was all knotted at 44-44.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh made it academic with two charity tosses and when she dumped in a hoop with 3:15 left, the Kingstreeters were in charge at 48-44.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the fourth, the teams exchanged turnovers, South Windsor posted two big misses from deep and eventually, Eastern found itself with two one-and-one situations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two clutch foul shots by both Drury and Parent over the closing 37.2 seconds sealed the deal for Eastern as the locals came away with an outstanding six-point win (52-46) to move on in tournament play against No. 3 Edwin O. Smith on Thursday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Edwin O. Smith had an outstanding season to date at 20-4 overall while downing Farmington (56-32) in Class L first round play…The Panthers - with the cool Thundercat's logo on their gymnasium floor (I smell a lawsuit) - dropped regular season decisions to just Scared Heart Academy (59-47), Newington (58-31) and Simsbury (39-31) and to Conard (34-30) in CCC Tournament play. Back on January 3, Smith dropped South Windsor by a 57-35 final.</p>
