<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If government meetings scratch your itch (wink, wink, nudge, nudge), then tonight you are in luck. The Zoning Commission meets at 6. In fact, it is a special meeting, so you might want to get gussied up. Ooh! La-la!</p>

<p>In the fifth inning in Houston, New York Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson hit his second week flyball out of the game to Astros centerfielder Cesar Cedeno.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mets went on to lose 2-1 but the 10,619 in attendance and the countless others listening on the radio were detrimentally affected for the rest of their dreary lives by Harrelson’s inept flyballs. The 16-year veteran and World Series champion has yet to apologize for his failings that night.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
