<p>ROCKY HILL – The Bristol American Legion baseball team beat the weather on Monday evening but couldn’t do the same against Zone 3 rival RCP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol and RCP have had a bit of a postseason rivalry over the years and this time around, the contest from Rocky Hill went the way of the home teams as Post 2 fell by a 4-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RCP improved to 6-4 while Bristol fell to something along the lines of 4-4-3 with three games still to make up against NCL, Northeast and Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, RCP’s Zachary Zajac went six strong innings to earn the win. He allowed no runs on four hits while striking out seven and walking two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Carlstrom gave up a late run off a hit from Bristol’s Chase Belisle (3-for-3, double, stolen base, RBI) but Bristol couldn’t generate any additional offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Belisle ended up with three of Bristol’s seven total hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris went 2-for-4 with a couple singles while Jaydon Churchill and Edward Sanchez each tallied singles for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris scored the lone run for while Nick Sconziano was hit-by-a-pitch to get on base for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio, who brilliantly pitched the previous day against Ellington, earned a walk as did Belisle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol stranded nine runners on base as the big hit didn’t come until late in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Declan Schenck earned the loss for Post 2 but threw well over his 80 pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed four runs, three earned, struck out two and walked a couple over 5.1 innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Dunne mopped up late over 2/3 of an inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 allowed single runs in the first and third frames but trailed by a manageable 2-0 score going into the bottom of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a two-run fifth by RCP made it a 4-0 deficit for Bristol and the visitors never got any closer than three the rest of the way.</p>

<p><strong>Up next</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is in action on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week, hoping to dodge and duck Mother Nature along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, a little more gas money will be needed for Bristol’s trip to Enfield (5:45 p.m.) at Powder Hollow Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thursday, Post 2 travels to Middletown for a Zone 3 showdown and then on Friday, EHM comes to Muzzy Field for a date against Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those contests commence at 7 p.m. while one of those makeup games – against Northeast – is slated for Sunday at 11:30 a.m. in Bristol.</p>
