<p>The 2022 Mum Festival is underway at Memorial Boulevard and The Bristol Edition is well represented both as one of this year's Bronze Sponsors of the festival and with a booth on the boulevard. Come by for a visit.</p>

<p>Joining TBE, vendors line both sides of the boulevard and, along with a carnival, fill the entire field in front of the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School. Food trucks range from homecooked Polish meals featuring stuffed cabbage to Ted's of Meriden steamed cheeseburgers, tacos, the Lucky Hot Dog and more.</p>

<p>One stop might be Brian's Angels, which is raising funds through the sale of chrysanthemums. There are a couple of hundred that have to go, according to Pat Stebbins, founder of the organization. They are $12 a piece and look very good.</p>

<p>There is live music as well as seating under tents for listeners and diners. Antique, classic and collector cars are featured in the Car Show in the BAIMS parking lot. Tomorrow's schedule includes the Mum Festival Parade, beginning at 1:30 p.m. For an event calendar, click <a href="https://bristolmumfestival.com/2022/08/30/festival-events-announced/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
