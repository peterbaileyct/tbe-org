<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woodshop at the Douglas A. Beals Senior Community Center has been part of the organization from the beginning and continues to be the source of inspiration for its volunteers over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before 1985, the senior center was housed at the Bristol Historical Society, according to Jason Krueger, executive director of the senior center. Krueger is a wealth of information about the center and its most distinguished members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Board of Education decided to consolidate the middle school students into a couple of buildings in 1985,” Krueger said, "and move from Stafford Avenue to create Northeast Middle School. Douglas Beals then led the senior center group called the Westwoods School Conversion Committee. In 1987, the Bristol Senior Community Center took its place with designated rooms, an idea designed by Doug Beals."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the designated rooms was the senior center woodshop. The machines and equipment are original from the former middle school woodshop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1997, the senior center was rededicated as the Douglas A, Beals Senior Community Center because of his great acts on behalf of the retired and elderly in Bristol, Krueger said, referring to Beals.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior center woodshop was established and Walter Siel became the head volunteer of the shop. After Siel was Dino Bossi, with help from Larry Zbikowsky and Charlie Mackey II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Charlie was meticulous," Krueger said, "and was here every day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A memorial bench in recognition of Mackey's dedication is in the hallway outside the woodshop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another memorial bench dedicated in Bossi's name was crafted by current volunteers Fran Bonvisuto, Jay Murray, Zbikowsky and Don Fournier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Dino Bossi was a great mentor to me," Bonvisuto told me. "He was there for the members of the woodshop. He showed us how to use the machines and do projects. There is also a plaque in the hallway dedicated to Dino.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The memorial bench for Bossi was started in 2021, finished in July 2022, and dedicated in August 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, Bonvisuto, seven years a member, and Murray, two and a half years a member, share the responsibility as volunteer heads of the woodshop and are there five days a week, 8:30 a.m. through 11 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doris Grant, now a member of the Bristol Senior Center, told me, “The Bristol Boys and Girls Club, in the early 2000’s, had a kindergarten and afterschool program in the senior center building."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Dino Bossi fixed a rocking chair for the kindergarten, and even made toys and other furniture for them as needed. He was there to fix anything broken for the kids," Grant said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Dino and other seniors would also read to the kindergarteners,” according to Grant, who worked with the kids at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People who become woodshop volunteers seem to share many of the same traits. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steve Kosenko, who has been a member for less than a year, said, “While I was growing up, my father did woodworking as a hobby, and asked me to help him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in life, Kosenko worked in a machine shop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now woodworking is a way to relax and have fun," he said. "I wish I got older faster so I could have enjoyed this incredible senior center and the people earlier.” He also plays pickleball here with his wife, Diane.</p>

<p>Fournier has been a woodshop volunteer at the Bristol Senior Center for 30 years!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said, “I like to work with wood and the people that are here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His wife, Jeanette, who worked as a nurse for 45 years, was a volunteer, taking people's blood pressure at the time, and invited him to volunteer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"She did not trust me at home,” Don said jokingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added that working along side him has been Louis Thibeault.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Lou has been a woodshop volunteer longer than me,” Don said. Thibeault has been involved with the woodshop for 32 years!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are nine men and three women woodshop volunteers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was happy to talk to one of the women, Lisa Wagner. Wagner and her husband built their own home. She came to the senior center woodshop for help when she was trying to make an Italian dough box for pizza dough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woodshop volunteers helped her make it and then she started coming five days a week as a volunteer, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First you pick a project like a birdhouse and for two weeks they break down the project, piece by piece, and guide and help you build it," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You learn about safety in the woodshop, how to cut, cut angles, clamp together, join, square, sand, and how to use all the equipment. A key principle taught to you is: measure twice, cut once.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wagner has helped clean and organize the woodshop and storage shed. She made lettered drawers for organizing the hardware. She cleaned the shed by picking up wood and assigning certain places for hardwood and cedar.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The woodshop gets shipments of donated wood monthly like a recent one from people in Farmington,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woodshop also receives financial support from the Friends of The Bristol Senior Center, an auxiliary comprised of members and donors, Wagner said. The Friends purchased two pieces of equipment this year--they replaced a planer that was beyond repair and bought a new belt sander.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior center woodshop makes and sells, for the sole benefit of the center, bird whirligigs, bird houses, cutting boards, decorative holiday decor and tables.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volunteers also make custom designs to order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ordered a music stand, and a piano jewelry box of which I was happy to give as gifts. Bonvisuto is making a doll chair, and I see a rocking horse in the works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a wooden violin pendulum clock hanging on the woodshop wall made by Thibeault whom I mentioned has been a woodshop volunteer for 32 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This crafted clock by Thibeault is a symbol of everlasting membership and for the timeless contributions of wooden artwork made by the Bristol Senior Center woodshop volunteers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mantra that “the members run the senior center” was there at the beginning, Krueger said, and is practiced every day for the good quality of life of a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We would all like our new members to continue to help run Bristol Senior Center as it has been done for decades before by volunteering.” Krueger added.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
