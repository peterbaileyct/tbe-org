<p>The senator stated that he and Sen. Chris Murphy worked to make sure that the Bristol project was included among spending requested from the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Blumenthal spoke about the vital need for behavioral health and health care for the state’s communities, especially for children. </p>

<p>Blumenthal was joined at the construction site by Wheeler President and CEO Sabrina Trocchi, Bristol Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano, and the chair of Wheeler’s Board of Trustees, Mary Rodier. </p>

<p>Caggiano highlighted the work to bring the project to Bristol and the 200 employees that will work out of the new facility.</p>

<p>Trocchi remarked, “This is much more than a building, more than a health center. It is much more than a corporate headquarters. This year is Wheeler’s 55th anniversary, and 55 years of being a leader in caring for the state. One Hope St. will become Wheeler’s flagship location. We are bringing hope to Hope Street, in the form of local, professional jobs, and high-quality, integrated health care for the whole community.” </p>

<p>Trocchi had told TBE earlier that her hope was to have the project completed by early 2024. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the project is complete Blumenthal said he hopes to secure more funding to support behavioral health programs.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
