<p>Come Sunday morning, exam week will be winding down at school—the week started with the local NAACP scholarship breakfast on a holiday, so exam week began Tuesday will end Monday. It’s a nice stretch of time, since I often find myself playing catch up with grades.  And so it goes. </p>

<p>As for the scholarship breakfast, what a wonderful person Danisha Craig is. This item didn’t make it into yesterday’s news article, but her teacher Corey Nagle mentioned in his comments introducing her that Craig takes time from her busy schedule with the Energy Dept. in Washington, D.C., to mentor Bristol kids. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has produced some pretty outstanding people. We can add Danisha to the list, and she is just getting going. </p>

<p>Two weeks ago, on another rainy cold night, Mary and I headed to Hartford Stage for its latest production, Espejos: Clean. The drama is told in Spanish and English, with supertitles (translations for both languages appear on a screen above the stage). But this&nbsp;is simply not a play with subtitles. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main characters, one Canadian on a destination wedding at a resort and the other, a native Mexican working at the resort, appear on a cleverly designed stage, sometimes&nbsp;alone, sometimes in separate sectors of the stage, and other times in the same scene.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a risky undertaking that’s worth a look, not only for the novelty but also for its worldview and artistic storytelling. The play runs through Feb. 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening/reading -- I have been rummaging through New Yorker and Atlantic articles. A fun one is from the New Yorker, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/john-le-carres-search-for-a-vocation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Le Carre’s Search for a Vocation</a>.” Le Carre, of course, is the pen name of David Cornwall, who redefined the spy novel. His letters have just been published. Click here for the article. </p>

<p>One of the Atlantic articles, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/01/what-the-tech-and-media-layoffs-are-really-telling-us-about-the-economy/672791/?utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What the Tech and Media Layoffs are Really Telling Us About the Economy,</a>” points out that in the past 12 months, 130,000 people have been let go in from the tech sector.

<p>For listening, I returned to the Ezra Klein podcast, with a new episode guest-hosted by Roge Karma, a senior editor, while Klein is on a vacation break. It features professor at Columbia Law School and the director of the Center on Global Legal Transformation at Columbia, Katharine Pistor, who is the author of <em>The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality</em>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a> for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience. People with financial difficulties may write <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a> to be considered for free access.&nbsp;</p>
