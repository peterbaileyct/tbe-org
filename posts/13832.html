<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Bristol Central boys track &amp; field squad proved to be one of the top programs at the CIAC Class L championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain this past Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams finished in the top five, netting 66 total points for a slick fourth place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a strong day today,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hillhouse scored the team championship with 111.50 points while&nbsp; Simsbury (100) nabbed second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the only other program to top Central was Naugatuck, seizing third place with 76 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To qualify for the State Open, each individual or relay squad had to place in the top five of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And boy, did the Rams have some movers and shakers in New Britain that will compete at the Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Porrini was simply tremendous</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To say Central’s Frankie Porrini had a day would be the biggest understatement of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The standout junior qualified for the State Open in three different distance events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He took second place in the 800 meters (1:58.21), netting another sub-two minute time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini was also third in the 1600 meters (4:22.79) and added a fourth place finish in the 3200 (9:36.79).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie Porrini was an absolute beast running the 1600, 800, 3200 triple,” said Stafford-Kirk. “That’s tough and I don't think I've ever had another runner do that at the state meet. He ran personal records in the 800 and 3200 and just missed his best in the 1600. To say he was unbelievable today is an understatement. That is one of the best days by an athlete for me. Ever.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boxley, Conrod, and Rosa excel as well</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jarrett Boxley was one of many dual winners for the Rams that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made a second place finish in the 110 hurdles (16.10 seconds) while teammate Noah Conrod finished fourth in the 400 meters (51.18 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the duo combined forces, along with Cassias Breland and Victor Rosa, to take third place in the 4x100 relay (43.72 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa then had a remarkable showing in the javelin, taking runner-up honors with a heave of 172 feet, eight inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the javelin, Victor Rosa was super impressive,” said Stafford-Kirk. “He's been throwing here and there throughout the season but stepped up to win the CCC South with [a throw of] 158 feet, three inches last week. We took a chance and took him out of the 200 meters to throw javelin today and boy, did he heave it! 172 feet, eight inches is unbelievable. Victor's throws the last two weeks proves even more just how good of an athlete he truly is.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Blair, Jones, and Lauretti perform well in the field</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also earning trips to the State Open event was Tre Blair in both the high (fifth, 5-10) and long jumps (fourth, 41-7.25), Malachi Jones’s toss of 44 feet, 11.25 inches was good for fifth in the shot put while Dan Lauretti took fourth in the discus (130-8).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Senior captains Jarrett Boxley, Dan Lauretti, and Malachi Jones are all moving on to the Open,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Those three have been with me since freshman year, dealt with the heartache of us losing the 2020 season and came back hungrier than ever. I'm really proud of them along with fellow senior Noah Conrod who qualified in the 4x100 and open 400.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central achieves up and down the line-up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also performing well for the Rams was the 4x400 meter relay squad of Logan Jackson, Conrod, Can Tomak, and Rowan Hennessey (12th, 3:39.45) while Chris Roy, Patrick Wininger, Julieen Lopez, and Hennessey finished the 4x800 meter relay in 14th place (8:54.96)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Paulino nabbed seventh place in the triple jump (38-6.75) and Ashton Zabka’s throw of 41 feet, three inches was good for ninth in the shot put.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All around, it was a complete effort by the Rams at the Class L’s biggest event of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And next season, the deck will continued to be stacked for Central’s outstanding boys track and field&nbsp; program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Junior Tre Blair stepped up in high jump and triple jump to score much needed points and sophomore Cassias Breland leads a young group of athletes who have had a strong season and look to help us out a lot in the future,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Those athletes include juniors Chris Roy, Lance Archibald, Can Tomak, sophomores Anthony Paulino, Patrick Wininger, Rowan Hennessey, Logan Jackson and freshman Julieen Lopez."&nbsp;</p>
