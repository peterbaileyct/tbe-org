<p>EAST HARTFORD â€“&nbsp;After a tough loss to Bristol Central the previous Monday, the Bristol Eastern baseball team made a loud response against East Hartford in CCC interdivisional play on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers collected 19 hits while receiving a complete game pitching effort from Caleb Molinsky as the squad defeated the Hornets by a 11-1 final on Tuesday afternoon from McKenna Field in East Hartford.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 6-13 overall while East Hartford fell to 7-13.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hitting front, the Lancers'&nbsp;Ben D'Amato went a perfect 4-for-4 at the plate with three singles and a double, scoring three runs and driving in one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Schenck went 3-for-3 on three singles, scored a run and generated an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason Harris,&nbsp;Isaac Roberge, Rio Fernandez, and Kyle Babin all collected two hits apiece to lead the offense charge for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky was on the money, allowing four hits, one run, striking out 10 and walking just one over seven tough innings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired the side in order in three of the innings, facing just 28 batters overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was scoreless until the top of the third when Eastern scored three times and then added runs in each inning thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those crooked numbers really started to add up in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, D'Amato and Roberge each drove in runs to help the Lancers snare a 3-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern added two runs in the fourth as an RBI single from Harris and a run scoring error made it a 5-0 tilt after four innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cushion&nbsp;grew to 8-0 in the fifth as the Lancers collected six hits in the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A two-run single by Connor Cyr and a run scoring base hit from Schenck helped put the game away with the Kingstreeters ahead by eight runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams traded runs in the sixth with the Lancers seizing a 9-1 lead by the completion of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato opened the top of the sixth inning with a double to left center, scoring on a sacrifice fly by Roberge, as the contest was all but over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to add a little icing on the cake in the top of the seventh, an&nbsp;RBI single from Gabe White and a double off the bat of Harris scored the final two runs as Eastern won big on the road, 11-1.&nbsp;</p>
