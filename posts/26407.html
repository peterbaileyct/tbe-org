<p>“We’re counting down the days until opening day, which will also be Law Enforcement Appreciation Night,” said Sarah Lucian. “We wanted to start the season by honoring Lt. Dustin DeMonte and Sgt. Alex Hamzy,” said Lucian. “We’re thankful for everything that our police officers have done and continue to do.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucian, who is the director of Community Partnerships for the Bristol Blues, said that admission for all law enforcement personnel will be free on opening day, Friday, June 9. </p>

<p>The Blues will be kicking off their 2023 season with an away game against the Newport Gulls on June 7. The boys will face the Valley Blue Sox in Holyoke Massachusetts before their opening day contest against the Mystic Schooners at Muzzy Field.</p>

<p>Blues fans will see several familiar faces on the diamond this summer, including big lefty Joe Rios in the infield and Bristol native Jagger Duquette on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our hometown boy’s back,” said Lucian. “Jagger’s a fan favorite for sure because he’s a good player and just a really great guy. We can’t wait to see him on the mound.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette, a graduate of Bristol Eastern High School, will be making his third appearance on the Blues’ roster. The former Lancer first took the mound for the Blues in 2019 before entering his freshman year at Wagner College. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tim Binkoski will be returning for his second season as the Blues’ manager after leading the team to a league-tying 32-12 record and the Western Division Championship in 2022. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be a great season,” said Lucian. “Tickets are just $6 and we can’t wait for fans to meet our new mascot, Mojo.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s going to be a fun summer of Muzzy Magic.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
