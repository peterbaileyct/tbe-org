<p>The Bristol Eastern volleyball team made quick work of E.O. Smith on Thursday night, rolling to an easy three-set victory. The set scores were 25-9, 25-14, and 25-8, as the Lancers excelled in all aspects of the game. The only positive for the visitors was they got back to Storrs pretty early, as the match was over almost as soon as it began.<br></p>
