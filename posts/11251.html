<p>(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont today announced the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) is awarding $24 million in federal funds to ten transportation projects aimed at improving air quality in Connecticut. As part of the Federal Highway Administration’s Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program, Connecticut invests federal funds in local, cost-effective projects that will reduce vehicle exhaust emissions in areas of the state that do not attain national air quality standards.</p>

<p>CMAQ funds will be distributed to municipalities to support local projects, which include upgrading traffic signal technology and the installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Modernized traffic signals use real-time traffic information to accommodate changing traffic patterns, which reduces unnecessary idling at traffic lights.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol</strong> will receive $3,370,500 to improve traffic operations with better traffic signal timing and pedestrian crossings in the downtown area in anticipation of Depot Square development.</p>
