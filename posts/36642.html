<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For incumbents:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do you consider to be your major accomplishments during your term? And why? Not all but the most significant ones, please.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know everyone usually expects an answer of economic development, but I also want to highlight the importance of undergirding our service departments. Making sure that public works, parks, fire, police, education, library and other crucial departments that provide service to the community have the tools, talent and training to serve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listening to their budget request and finding solutions to fund and implement is always a challenge but we have been very successful while managing impact to taxpayers. Shifting resources, cutting here to fund there – isn’t sexy and never makes the headlines – but if done correctly has a tremendous impact.<br>For example the dog pound; shortly after elected, members of the public reached out to complain about the conditions. We studied the building and concluded that it would be putting good money into a bad asset and developed a plan to replace taking input from all stakeholders. We are starting a building committee in the next month, while at the same time looking for cost sharing options through grants or shared services with other communities to offset expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I promised when I was elected that I would roll up my sleeves and work on behalf of my constituents. I would be their advocate and their voice. I have been approachable, l have been available and I have brought action to help resolve the many issues or questions that they have. Knowing I have made an impact in someone’s situation or life is very fulfilling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do you consider to be the most critical or significant moments over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol suffered an unspeakable tragedy in 2022; losing two of our finest. It is hard to put into words the emotions that this evokes. While are hearts were broken, the demonstration of love and respect from the community was unmatched. We were able to respond with a new four-year contract with our Police Department offering a competitive wage demonstrating value in our existing force while also giving us the edge in recruitment to hire the best and brightest to patrol our streets. Additionally, it helped us care for the families of the fallen officers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a very positive note, seeing the groundbreaking for two major projects (Wheeler and Carrier) in downtown is causing an excitement not felt in years. Knowing retail and restaurants will follow has residents buzzing!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as a result of your experience over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mayor appointed me Deputy Mayor for the full two years of his term. In addition, I serve on the Salary Committee (Chair), Ordinance, Public Works, Capital Improvement and Strategic Planning, City Arts and Culture, Real Estate and Pine Lake committees. Prior to election I served 15 years on the Board of Finance, 5 as the chair. I additionally served on the Fire Engine 4 Building Committee, Greene-Hills School Committee, Retirement Board, Energy Commission, Police Board (liaison) and the Memorial Boulevard Task Force.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am truly excited for the growth we are experiencing! Finally, people will have a reason to come downtown. Restaurants, shops, modern apartments will start making downtown a destination. I enjoy being part of the City Arts and Culture Commission as we are able to showcase the tremendous talent that already exists in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I love the diversity we are experiencing in the community. Every culture adds something new and bold to experience and helps us recognize and appreciate the value of each individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have knocked on a lot of doors! Additionally, I take the opportunity to strike up conversation with residents at the many events and activities I attend. The residents have shared that they feel the right team is in place to bring the projects to completion while at the same time continue a pattern of growth offering more options so residents can play, shop and dine without having to travel far. They reported they have a local government that listens, cares and responds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if reelected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always the financial conservative; I feel the one of our other challenges will be in managing debt. With new buildings and new schools coming online – we need to make sure we don’t over leverage. We need to make sure the right projects are selected and effectively manage existing assets with proper maintenance and upkeep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Helping small businesses choose and grow in Bristol is a vital part for the community. They offer a variety of services, employment opportunity and are great supporters of community events!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strategically planning of future projects, ensuring equity among departments is key to a balance approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing information is key, we just recently selected a vendor for asset management, which will help staff assess and manage our building/vehicle/equipment inventory tracking repairs, conditions and replacement schedules. We can track work orders and cost to repair and maintain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has implemented several grant programs to help businesses start and grow in our community. We need to make sure they continue to be funded.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was originally motivated to run when the Republican Party swept the 2021 election. I felt that with what was going on nationally with the Republican Party, was being brought into the city. We have had a lot of racial issues that have come up and have not been dealt with during the past year and if they are, we as a community have not heard anything about what is being done to rectify this issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city has lost a lot of businesses over the last couple of years and have not done anything to save them and we cannot lose them without losing jobs too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one thing that is most critical is all of the racist issues we have had and making people feel uncomfortable to be part of this community. We need to protect and make our residents feel safe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue with losing businesses is another big issue that needs to be dealt with. We are losing both jobs and places that we can go out to eat, drink or even shop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies you for office? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am currently part of the Energy Commission and have been on there since April 2023. Prior to that I have not had much political credentials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I currently view our city as a city that is growing, but has taken steps back due to racism. Between fliers being spread throughout the city, to protests to “Keep CT White” and even writing swastikas on street signs and racial slurs on the ground, Bristol has a racism issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experiences/facts that confirm this view. Nothing has been done with any of the fliers, protests and writing of slurs that have been spread and seen around Bristol. If anything is being done, the current administration should be letting the residents know that something is being done and how they are going to try to prevent additional in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if elected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge? Stopping Racism is huge, because it is everywhere, but I want our citizens to feel safe. Working with the mayor’s office and the police to put an end to our nightmare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next two years if elected I will work on our racism issues and also work with the mayor, no matter who it is to bring more businesses into the city. We need to fill the open store fronts that we now have all over Bristol and retain their business.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past year, really two, I have witnessed the destruction of our diverse social fabric in favor of political posturing, ego inflating, and back room deals. Our incumbent mayor and council have made clear that diversity, inclusion, equality, and the pursuit of happiness is not a priority for them. They are choosing not to make people a priority! From the failure to fly the Pride flag or acknowledge Pride month at all, to failure to address racist propaganda littered throughout the city. This administration only responds when they are confronted and never steps up to stand up for anyone, instead they would rather complain that denouncing racism is political. To be clear on this, racism is only political when one side refuses to speak out against it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also witnessed with the rest of this city our police officers grieve during tragedy, and then had to watch the mayor selfishly talk about how it was his birthday, and HIS birthday has been forever changed. As a paramedic I responded to a mother killed in front of her children on my birthday years ago, my concern and worry about that day has always been how the children are doing and not that this tragedy occurred on “my” special day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most significant moments are the times that compassion from our leaders was lost and that groups of people were isolated from our community. The very first decision this administration made was to hold its inauguration at the Liberty Baptist Church, a church that has publicly disparaged and demeaned LGBTQIA+ members of our community that are personal friends of mine. The next critical failure of this administration was the “hit job” on the Wheeler project, which for a mayor that continually calls to end the stigma surrounding mental health is puzzling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies you for office?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a child of a Town Committee member I grew around politics and city government, and since I have always followed local government and voted regularly, which seems to be more than most it seems these days. For the past two decades I was a Paramedic working in the City of Hartford, Waterbury, Torrington, and Bristol. In EMS you learn competency, duty, responsibility, commitment, and service to others above all else. Being a first responder, you make a commitment to the public that their lives and safety comes before yours for the most part and at times have been the only available Paramedic to the 62,000 residents of this City. The commitment to bear the weight of 62,000 lives on my shoulders, I believe qualifies me for the role of City Councilman. Additionally, my wife Erika and I own Bakery On Maple in the Federal Hill district. Our business, just like ourselves, is committed to advancing the widespread acceptance and inclusion of our diverse community. As a business owner, first responder, and resident of Bristol I have very unique experiences and perspectives that wholly qualify me for the office of Councilperson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I view the city positively, there’s no reason not to. We are growing, but not at the pace we should be. We are moving downtown and economic development, but we are heading for a lull in action since the current administration has failed to make deals on any new projects and has not sold any new parcels downtown. Even the Baumer project for Industrial park parcels 10 and 11 was started in the summer of 2021. Even though it may not seem positive Bristol is in perfect spot to move forward from this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a retail business, the bakery gives me a great opportunity to talk and listen to what our customers are saying. People are worried about this administration “robbing Peter to pay Paul” by pulling existing Bristol businesses downtown and leaving vacancies throughout the city. I’m also hesitant to go along with a plan to bring mostly food, entertainment, and nightlife to downtown during the initial redevelopment. Unfortunately, those industries are not as “recession proof” as healthcare is, and I think our downtown bases should be anchored with businesses that are steady economic drivers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also can confirm that our city is not welcoming or supportive of Diversity, Inclusion, or Equity. We have small pockets of hope but any chance of meaningful advances are quashed by blatant racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, and disgusting behavior that is rewarded by this mayor through political appointments.</p>
