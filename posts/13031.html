<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern baseball team is still putting the entire package together this season but the squad isn’t very far off in terms of cobbling together wining efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And outside of a 14-2 setback back at Northwest Catholic on April 22, the locals have proven to be a tough out, usually one hit away from getting to the pay window or at least tying up a contest late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been in every single game,” said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet. “There’s been one game where we weren’t competitive or had a lead late. It will come. We’ve just got to get those timely hits.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have lost five games by three runs or less this year as things have been ever so close for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the program’s last four setbacks have been by a total of eight runs, including a 5-3 defeat against Northwest Catholic on Friday, April 29 and the recent 1-0 loss to Central this past Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the program is seemingly one hit away from turning those two bouts around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in terms of overall hitting, the Lancers are much improved in that category since last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, Eastern’s season-ending batting average – if turned into cash – couldn’t buy the program a tasty chocolate milkshake from Dunphy’s Ice Cream parlor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the program has certainly rebounded this year, batting just under .270 for the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Super sophomore Ben D’Amato is leading the squad in batting average, going 15-of-34 overall, for a nifty .441 clip that also includes three doubles and a near .460 on-base percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill is just batting under .300 with 10 hits while Cole Latko is chimes in at .258 with eight hits and five walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve hit the ball,” said Gaudet. “We’re averaging 5.7 runs-per-game or something like that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Eastern’s ERA isn’t all that bad and after the Central game, the squad’s number is hovering around 4.33 as the Lancers did not allow their crosstown rival an earned run over its 1-0 loss against the Rams last Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our pitching has done pretty well all year,” said Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Roalf (0-3) put up a bigtime performance against the Rams while Ryan Maglio (2-2) has been progressing nicely at the varsity level, posting a team-leading 22 strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill (1-1) has the other Eastern win, throwing a 5-2 gem against Maloney on April 27 while Caleb Molinsky, D’Amato, Anthony Nocera, and Owen Myers have all seen time on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will enter this week at 3-7 and will look to go at least .500 the rest of the way in its playoff push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has a busy slate of four games this week, starting with a contest against CCC Interdivisional foe Rocky Hill on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next Week’s Schedule (weather permitting):</strong></p>
