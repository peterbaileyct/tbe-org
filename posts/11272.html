<p>PLAINVILLE - It’s two-in-a-row for the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team as the Lancers collected a 63-35 victory over Plainville from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium on Thursday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils, who never led in the showdown, fell to 1-17 with two games remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters shot the ball extremely well, hitting 15-of-26 field goals (57.7-percent) at the half and led by a 35-13 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern senior Ciara Collins was impressive once again, hitting four three-pointers on her way to a game-high 24 points while adding six rebounds, six assists, and four steals. She canned 9-of-15 shots overall and 4-of-6 hoops from downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent canned 6-of-7 shots to start the game - leading to an impressive 16-point effort which included two 3s and two assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens posted eight points, three rebounds, two assists, and three steals while Janessa Gonzalez added seven points, eight rebounds, and three steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury didn’t score a point but contributed three rebounds and four assists, Leah Roy added five points and a couple rebounds, and Gracie LaMar tallied three rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Lilly Wazorko led the squad with&nbsp;11 points while Elyse Brown tallied nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent found Collins for a late hoop in the first period to make it a double-figure game and when Stavens dished the ball over to Parent for a 3, it was a 22-9 contest through eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins scored 10 points over the first quarter while Parent nabbed eight as both shooters dropped in two 3-point bombs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second stanza belonged to Collins and Parent offensively as the duo cashed in on all of the squad’s 13 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins notched seven and Parent added six while the team held the Blue Devils to just four total points on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Collins cashed in on an offensive rebound for a bucket to end the half, Eastern grabbed a 35-13 push at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens opened the third quarter scoring for the Kingstreeters with a 3 as the lead was slowly extended to 30 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the third, Stavens was shooting from deep again - draining a near NBA-range three-pointer - and with a quarter to go, Eastern’s 52-22 cushion allowed the visitors to sub freely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins dropped in a 3 early to start the fourth, Gonzalez hit a hoop midway through the final frame and with the score at 59-25 halfway through the stanza, Eastern head coach Tony Floyd had his bench mop up - leading to the 28-point victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back in action Saturday at 1:30 p.m. against Conard and then battles Bristol Central on Monday at 6:45 from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
