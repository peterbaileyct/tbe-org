<p>The first day of early voting yesterday in Bristol brought 52 people to the polling site in council chambers at city hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The day was slow and steady," said Kevin McCauley, one of Bristol's two registrars of voters. "We had 29 Democrats and 23 Republicans. The mayor was the first."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a line of people waiting at 10 a.m., when the doors opened, he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting began Tuesday, March 26, and continues today, Thursday and Saturday. The polling place is closed on Good Friday. Doors open at 10 a.m. and close at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Everything pretty much went to plan," McCauley said. "We haven't found anything limited or missing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He attributed the smooth operations to preplanning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following are on the Democratic primary ballot: Joe Biden, Dean Phillips. Cenk Uygur and<br>Marianne Williamson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those on the Republican primary ballot include the following: Ryan Binkley, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who have not registered and who would like to participate in early voting need to file a voter registration application for one of the two parties holding a primary with the registrar by noon on the business day before the day they plan to vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the deadline for first-time registration to vote in person is April 1 by noon at the registrar’s office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the April 2 primary, there is one change in polling places–those who voted at Bristol Elks Club will now be voting at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
