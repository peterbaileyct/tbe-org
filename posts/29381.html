<p>BRISTOL – When the Bristol Blues beat their first-round opponent in the New England Collegiate Baseball League playoffs, the locals had some real momentum heading into the Final Four.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping its opener to the Valley Blue Sox on Monday, July 31, the Blues were able to win the next two games – earning a 2-1 victory in quarterfinal play and went immediately into the semifinal round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the stakes a lot higher, how would the Blues fare against the Stanford Mainers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about a two-game sweep of the program to earn its shot at the NECBL championship?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a good week of baseball for the Blues (25-19-1 overall) and the triumph over Stanford was as good as it gets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a possible NECBL championship in the cards for the Blues’ sometime this week, here’s how the locals were able to sweep its way by the Mainers in another best-of-three showdown:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Best-of-three semifinals against the Sanford Mariners&nbsp;- Final Four</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Game 1 – Bristol Blues 12, Sanford Mariners 7 – Thursday, August 3&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol never trailed in its showdown against Sanford and every time the home team notched a run, the Blues had a response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a 1-1 stalemate going into the seventh stanza, the Blues notched four runs in the seventh and then added another seven in the eighth to snare a 12-3 edge, never looking back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Griffin Arnone unleashed a home run, collecting a run and three RBI to lead the offensive charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joey Rios smacked out three hits – including an RBI – while Tyler Fote (two runs, two RBI), Billy Sullivan (two runs) and Connor Goodman (walk, RBI) collected two hits apiece over the winning effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol starter Randy Reyes threw extremely well but just missed out factoring into the ultimate decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reyes went 5.1 innings, allowed two hits, one earned run and walked three while fanning three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quick relief stint by Jaden Wywoda (0.2 IP, one K) earned the chucker a 14-pitch win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, played from Goodall Park in Sanford, Maine, is a 3:30 hour trip from Bristol, and the Blues’ squad – if it could help it – did not want to go back up I-495 for a third and final game against the Mariners on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Game 2 – Bristol Blues 4, Sanford Mariners 2 – Friday, August 4&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*A third and final game was not needed between the squads as Bristol won the second contest by two runs, punching its ticket to the NECBL championship round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol, with 805 eager fans looking on from Muzzy Field, had to overcome a 2-0 mid-game deficit to finally send the opponents back home to Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, Fote walked, stole second with two away, and a single to center by Skye Selinsky forced the lead runner home as Bristol was on the board, trailing 2-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the sixth, Rios and Sullivan slammed out back-to-back singles and a sacrifice fly from Ian Battipaglia scored Rios as the game was all knotted up at 2-2 entering the critical seventh stanza.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, the winning run came and went as a single to right by Parrillo scored Gavin Noriega as the Blues secured a 3-2 edge, never allowing Maine to take it away from home standing Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting pitcher Danny Macchiarola was sensational for the Blues but did not factor into the ultimate decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went six innings, allowed just four hits on two runs, walking just one while posting five strikeouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win came out of the bullpen for Bristol again as Chad Fedeli was simply lights out over his 19 pitch, four strikeout showing – snaring the ‘W’ in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brent Francisco (1 IP, two Ks) picked up Bristol’s first save of the postseason as the Blues earned a shot at a NECBL title against the Newport Gulls - a 16-6 victor over the Danbury Westerners to set up the Fay Vincent, Sr. Cup Championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be the Gulls going up against the Blues this week for all the marbles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The </strong><strong>NECBL Championship Series</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Fay Vincent, Sr. Cup commences on Sunday, August 6 in one final best-of-three challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Games 1 and 3 (if necessary) will be played at Cardines Field in Newport, Rhode Island while Game 2 takes place from Muzzy Field on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games are set for a 6:30 p.m. start time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Bristol outhit Sanford 22-13 over the two-pack of games…Danbury had to win its game against Newport on Saturday to force the best-of-three series to a winner-take-all showdown on Sunday but could not…The Blues have yet to lose a playoff game in regulation this year…Newport (34-12 overall) is 3-1 in postseason play, winners of three straight and had the best record in NECBL play this season.</p>
