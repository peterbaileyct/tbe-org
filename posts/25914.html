<p>MIDDLETOWN â€“ Who is going to beat the Bristol Eastern boys track and field team this year?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several teams tried but none have been successful in that gambit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the winning ways continued for the Lancers last Tuesday as Eastern held off Middletown by a 97-53 final in a CCC South showdown on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meet, held at Middletown High School, saw the Kingstreeters rack up a double-figure first place tally over several events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayshon Andrews could be the fastest sprinter in the Mum City, winning the 100 meters (11.1 seconds), 200 meters (22.1 seconds) and long jump (19 feet, 10 inches) events while leaping sensation&nbsp;Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum cleared 38 feet, 11 inches in the triple jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zion Otero won both hurdle events for the locals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished the 110 hurdles in 17.2 seconds and took home the 300 hurdles in 44.6 seconds for his second victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jumping&nbsp;Jack Mulcunry was excellent in the 400 meters, finishing in 51.6 seconds while Aidan Gezelman won the 3200 meters in 11:40.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the field, the Lancers had several standouts as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Phoenix Diaz won the discus with a toss of 113 feet, six inches while Austin Shorette was a dual winner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His javelin chuck of 118 feet even won him the event while throwing the discus 100 feet, seven inches for the win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Football standout&nbsp;Michael Sherrill Jr. cleared five feet, eight inches in the high jump while the Eastern program nabbed victories in two of the three relay events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zion Otero, Justin Sanchez, Dylan Bartucca, and Mulcunry&nbsp;won the 4x400 meter relay in 3:38 and in the 4x800 relay, the outfit of Brendan Tartarelli, Aidan Gezelman, Aidan Tartarelli, and Jase Koczur&nbsp;were the victors in a final time of 10:55.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back to work on May 9 when the squad travels to Berlin for a CCC South confrontation at Biscoglio Track (3:45 p.m.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are looking to keep the momentum going with a showdown at Bristol Central (May 16, 3:45 p.m.) looming not that far off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mulcunry breaks his own record at the Middletown Invite</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 800 meter event from the Middletown Invite this past weekend, Mulcunry reestablished the school record in the 800 meters - placing third in a time of 1:56.20.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That time is a new record at Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also from Middletown, Lawrence-Bynum took fourth place in the triple jump with a leap of 41 feet, 1.25 inches while the squad of Dominic and Brendan Tartarelli, Koczur and Mulcunry were the runner-up of the 4x800, finishing the race in 8:25.08 overall.&nbsp;</p>
