<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team was shut out by Simsbury on Friday afternoon, losing a 4-0 decision at the Lancer Dome. &nbsp;Eastern was let down by their defense, and wasted an excellent pitching performance by Caleb Molinsky.</p>

<p>Molinsky threw a complete game, giving up just four singles, walking two, striking out five, and allowing no earned runs. &nbsp;But Eastern was guilty of five errors, accounting for all of the Trojansâ€™ runs.</p>

<p>In the Simsbury third, Mitch Wallman reached on an infield error, went to third on a single to right by Cameron&nbsp;Denalsky, and scored on a wild pitch. &nbsp;A walk and&nbsp;an&nbsp;rbi single by Colby Wilhelm scored&nbsp;Denalsky, giving Simsbury a 2-0 lead.</p>

<p>In the Simsbury fourth, Lucas Gifford opened the inning with a single to center and promptly stole second base. &nbsp;A walk and a sacrifice put the runners on second and third with one out. Molinsky recorded a strikeout for the second out, but then an outfield error allowed both runners to score, and Simsbury now led by 4-0.</p>

<p>Simsbury pitcher Ty Petras was just as effective as Molinsky. &nbsp; &nbsp;Petras, a senior lefthander, threw a complete game, allowing four hits, walking two and striking out four. &nbsp;Petras threw just 81 pitches in the game, which took only an hour and thirty-five minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
