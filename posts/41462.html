<p>Welcome to Friday. Next stop, Rowayton. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weather</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll be looking live at sunny, 37, and really windy. Power outages are possible, and so too are medical malpractice suits so be careful out there. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What’s hot &amp; what’s not</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hot: Tuesday, the city of Bristol plowed the roads and picked up garbage. Yo!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not: millions of dollars in cost increases for Bristol building projects. That does not even take into account any kickbacks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How gauche</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Library Board, the crucible for all things prompt and books, adjourned their meeting on Dec. 4, 2023, at 7:42 p.m. Eastern Time. Can you imagine not waiting until 7:45 p.m.? </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If today is your birthday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The witness protection program never looked so good. Avoid, delay, and obfuscate appearing in court. Best not to encounter county officials or the police either. Also, your sub-conscience will be working overtime today. You’ve earned the guilt, so wear it.  Happy birthday, though. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let's all go to the lobby </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time for a pretzel, Bristol. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
