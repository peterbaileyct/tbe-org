<h2>Bristol Historical Society starts daily post 'Bristol Day by Day'</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Historical Society has started posting "In Retrospect: Bristol Day By Day," featuring moments from Bristol's history. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tagline for the daily post, that arrives by email, ends with "We hope you enjoy this walk through the archives." The daily chronicle accounts for both firsts and common occurrences, while others can be from many years ago or recent times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either way the events occurred on the date that the information is posted. On Tuesday, the post was from Jan. 17, 1951, offering a photo of 12-year-old Peter Anderson, who was a polio survivor, kicking off that year's March of Dimes campaign.</p>

<h2>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
