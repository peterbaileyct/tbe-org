<p>Come Sunday morning, the clocks will have been turned back an hour, signaling the end of Daylight Savings Time, pushing our sunsets from around 5:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. It's what we do, right. Here at the house, a painting project that we started early in October has been stretched out, from rain and cold, and if we don't get it done today, well, we intend to.</p>

<p>We have the oldest and friends showing up today to finish the job, painting the garage. Mary has scraped paint and glazed windows. I have scraped and primed. It's going to be a long day, but in the end, a satisfying one--and we will have checked one more item off the to do list.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we have our municipal elections on Tuesday. The lawn signs have been out for a while. The municipal forums and candidate meet-and-greets completed. Candidates have been knocking doors. We hope you have become familiar with the people and the issues. Along those lines, Sunday afternoon TBE will publish candidate profiles--of candidates who have responded to our requests for answers to questions that we think are important to Bristolites. We hope they are helpful.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week has been hit or miss. I am still, slowly, making my way through "The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store." It's a terrific novel, and one for our times. The author, James McBride, has a wry sense of humor, irony really, and a wonderful way to handle difficult material. I admit, though, I am moving slowly through the book, for the only reason that there are some many things to attend to every day.</p>

<p> Other than the novel, I have been making my way through recent issues of The New Yorker. One of the articles, from the Oct. 30 issue, is "Trapped: The life and death of Tupac Shakur." As much as the article is about Shakur, it is also about culture, American culture and what fascinates us.</p>

<p>And of course, Connecticut Magazine, this month, features Donovan Clingan, who is now leading the charge for the UConn Huskies men's basketball program. A national championship last year and a tough schedule this year, only makes the subject of Clingan more intriguing, and really a very Bristol story.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
