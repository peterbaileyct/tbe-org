<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Eastern volleyball program is in the midst of another sensational year, posting a 9-2 mark to date against several CCC state powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volleyball is always competitive in the CCC and the wars between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern programs are always a treat. <br>And sometimes those scores, that could look a little lopsided in Eastern’s favor, do not always tell the ultimate picture.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, Central has been nipping at Eastern’s collective heels on the court but simply can’t figure out a way to topple the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s that been the story 56 times in a row.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last Monday’s game between the programs was a macrocosm of that as Eastern defeated Central by a 3-1 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of BEHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed early in the first set but managed to post a 25-23 win which was following up by a 25-20 victory in the second game, leading to a 2-0 lead for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central played extremely well in the third tilt, snaring a 25-17 win, before Eastern took control of an error-filled fourth set by the Rams – leading to a 25-15 defeat and a 3-1 victory by the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was really just playing as a team,” said Eastern senior outside hitter Lauren Bender of the fourth set win. “We really came together at the end and focused on playing for each other and that was our motivation for winning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hanging with RHAM</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Central and Eastern volleyball programs have fallen to RHAM this season, but the Lancers put up a very good fight against the Raptors last Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers dropped a tough 3-1 decision behind set scores of 25-18, 25-16, 23-25 and 25-22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bender had another big outing, collecting 22 of her squad’s 39 kills, while tallying 12 digs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabby Caucci dropped in three aces, Lilli Lowe blocked a couple shots, Emily Valentine bumped up 17 digs and added 24 assists and Andrea Martir-Perez scooped up nine assists to help the cause against one of the state’s best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM is 13-3 overall, losing to two programs outside of Connecticut in September over in-season tournament play, while Simsbury – the only other program to knock off the Lancers – is 12-1 in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern lost two matches this season to programs with a combined 25-4 ledger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a telling tale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>500 kills</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against RHAM, Bender smashed down her 500<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;career kill for the Lancers, a huge milestone for the senior standout.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in another honor, Bender was nominated – and won – the GameTimeCT Athlete of the Week award.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that surely won’t be the end of the awards and honors she receives this season as the Kingstreeters continue their onslaught on CCC volleyball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central is a tough out</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern coach Stefanie Reay credited Central for a great effort last Monday as the programs put together a great show, highlighting the talent that both public schools in Bristol can put on the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Central is doing a fantastic job,” said Reay of Central. “[Central coach] Lance [Pepper] is doing a great job. They have a good group of girls. They work really hard. [But] it’s exciting to be where we are at the end of tonight for sure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
