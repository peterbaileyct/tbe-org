<p>MERIDEN – With the postseason in sight, the Bristol Central boys basketball team had another easy one on Friday night, belting Maloney of Meriden by a 68-30 final in a CCC South attraction.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of attraction, the game belonged to the Rams’ All-World center Donovan Clingan as he dropped Maloney (6-12) for a game-high 22 points, 19 rebounds, and five blocks - needing just 15 and a half minutes to produce that incredible stat-line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, all of Central’s starters were subbed out with 6:16 left to play in the third quarter as the game was a 43-4 contest at the half (yes, you read that correctly).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Central’s third straight game of allowing the opponent less than 35 points and the locals are cruising into Monday night’s confrontation against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern on a 36-game winning streak – the most consecutive wins in program history. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans didn’t score a single point over the first eight minutes of action as the visiting aggression led 21-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even after a four point second quarter effort by Maloney, the home team trailed by 39 points and was already down and out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donte Collins led Maloney with nine points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Postseason stuff</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of CIAC Division II state tournament rankings, the Rams hold a one game lead over Northwest Catholic (18-1) and Central will be the number one seed in the upcoming CCC Tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On Tap</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central and Eastern will go to war this Monday at 6 p.m. from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will look to go undefeated in the regular season play for the first time since 1989-90 when Central went undefeated, was 24-0 overall, and won a state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC Tournament commences on Thursday and Central will have a home seed and should be ranked No. 1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the quarterfinal round takes place on Saturday from Enfield high school.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the semifinals and finals will also commence from Enfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Middletown no match for BC to open the week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the week, Central blasted CCC South rival Middletown by an 80-34 final on the road – giving the Rams a sweep over the Blue Dragons.</p>
