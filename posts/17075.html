<h3>The Big Story</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s see, today’s big story: Round 2 of the Ordinance Committee and the sale of cannabis in Bristol. Strap in people because here we go again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The staff of GMB can verify that there is no truth to the rumor that the city will distribute MREs to those that survive the ordinance committee meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of MREs…</p>

<h3>It Happened</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feb. 4, 1977, due to a communique from the State Civil Preparedness Director Frank Mancuso, city hall workers began “destocking fallout shelters.” As a result, workers removed water, candy, crackers, and disposal toilets that were stockpiled in a City Hall vault and storage rooms since 1961. The materials, intended for survivors of a nuclear holocaust, were disposed of at the dump.</p>

<h3>They Said it</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>May 21, 1953</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Mr. Barrett has made several remarks which suggest a public apology. I am of the opinion that the best interest of the city would be served if Mr. Barrett were to submit his resignation as a member of the Board of Finance, and I suggest that such be done at once.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Mayor Daniel J. Donovan regarding statements made by Board of Finance Commissioner Richard C. Barrett at a May 1 meeting.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Nov. 6, 1961</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bristol, asleep too long, is now wide awake.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Mayor Walter J. Murphy at his swearing in ceremony</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>May 7, 1968</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Either you had no specific recommendations in mind, or you are gutless. Although you refused to make recommendations when specifically asked to do so by Alexander Carros, Chairman of the Board of Finance, you issued a statement to the news media after the meeting charging the administration with fiscal irresponsibility. Public hearings were held on every phase of the new budget, but your attendance was sparse, and you had little to offer then.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Mayor Henry J. Wojtusik, at City Council meeting expressed his displeasure with three republican city council members over a salary dispute for school teachers</em>.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free&nbsp;access.</em></p>
