<p>Come Sunday morning, we will know that this year's Mum Festival Hometown Heroes will be the members of the Community Emergency Resource Team (CERT). They will join Mum Festival Parade grand marshal Fire Chief Rick Hart at the end of September when the Mum Festival tradition is carried on by the Bristol Exchange Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The members of CERT join Fire Chief Hart and the Exchange Club as those who reflect the best of Bristol. It's more than simply "nice" that this tradition continues. Perhaps, it is a testament to the belief that community is more than a notion than it is a continuous work in progress.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that as a people we'd like to think that these events go up on the calendar and are pretty much a done deal. You know, as well as I, that nothing is a done deal--every day might start out just like any other, but each day carries with it surprises. If we are alert to these surprises, that's pretty great--it adds some wonder and allows for curiosity. If not, typically, these surprises become obstacles and hindrances. </p>

<p>What separates one from the other, I suppose, is perspective, outlook, disposition. Just a thought. And of course, a segue into this column and its theme -- fostering democracy. For the longest time, I simply thought that democracy is part of a person's DNA. I am not so sure, and as an educator--once an educator, always an educator who spent years teaching in a high school classroom--I have gone from someone who once thought a democratic way of life was taken for granted to a person who believes that democracy must be taught. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the skills that this approach involves is the teaching of a democratic disposition. For instance, take the members of the Exchange Club. When they decided to take on the Mum Festival, the members know that this will require an effort, teamwork, messy interactions and a goal. They will need to rely on each other. Underlying this dynamic, however, there is something very basic--some rules of conduct.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How we comport ourselves is not a touchy-feely thing, despite the reality that we do have feelings. It is something we need to learn, not something that just happens, and we need each other to experience this and to engage with and to stumble over and to forgive each other and to get to the next place--together. And then to do it all over again.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a place to start. </p>

<p>For listening, try "Revisiting the 'father of capitalism," an episode from the Gray Area with Sean Illing podcast. The episode features Glory Lui, the author of "Adam Smith's America: How a Scottish Philosopher became an Icon of American Capitalism." Understanding capitalism is critical to the democratic experiment.</p>

<p>Last week, I recommended The Prof G Pod with Scott Galloway. This week, a friend recommended an interview of Scott Galloway by Michael Smerconish.

<p>Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
