<p>I have always been a bit gullible. I didn’t stop believing in Santa Claus until I turned 15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But last year, when I was told that Dairy Queen was opening in Bristol, my eyes were filled with visions of “Blizzards” and hot fudge sundaes. Every morning I would wake up and hope to myself, “I bet they broke ground today, DQ is only weeks away.”</p>

<p>Last summer, June ran into July, then August, then September…… you get the idea. My heart began to sink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a TBE reporter, I would prod my anonymous city government sources for news of the imminent opening. But the word was always the same, “We haven’t heard anything new.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I eventually stopped asking, and like that broken-hearted 15-year-old kid looking sadly at the Christmas tree, I have come to the tragic conclusion that Dairy Queen will never come to Bristol.</p>

<p>This is the site where it was supposed to appear, and I regret to say I have seen no hint of either a <strong>“D” or a “Q.”</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So to the faithful readers of TBE, I offer my sincere apology for getting your hopes up. It was wrong. But please know that no heart in Bristol is more broken than mine.</p>

<p>Yes, Bristol, there is no Dairy Queen. Is there anything I can ever believe in again?</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
