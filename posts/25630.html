<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bristol resident receives new washer and dryer from The Joe Andruzzi Foundation</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Parker, a cancer patient in Bristol, received a new washer and dryer from The Joe Andruzzi Foundation last month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The washing machine and dryer donation was granted through the Foundation’s Extraordinary Needs Program, which is in partnership with One Mission (OM) to provide New England cancer patients and their families with a one-time grant of up to $4,000 for project-based needs such as home improvement projects or dental work, according to a JAF press release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three-time Super Bowl champion, former New England Patriot and JAF chief engagement officer Joe Andruzzi, was on hand for the delivery.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Joe Andruzzi Foundation helps New Englanders battling cancer through a variety of grants including Household Assistance, Extraordinary Needs, Food Security Assistance, Transportation Assistance, (Up)Beat Opportunities and additional resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, more than $1 million was distributed in direct assistance to help 3,762 individuals with financial assistance to pay for housing, transportation, utilities, food, insurance, and other household expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Founded in 2008 by former New England Patriots three-time Super Bowl Champion offensive guard Joe Andruzzi and his wife Jen, the Joe Andruzzi Foundation grew out of Andruzzi's own successful battle with cancer and the couple’s ongoing work with young cancer patients. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2007, Joe’s football career abruptly ended when he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s Burkitt’s lymphoma. Disease-free less than a year later, Andruzzi and his wife, Jen, chose to dedicate their lives towards solving the financial distress a cancer diagnosis can cause in the lives of patients and families. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Mustangs, who play in the 35-plus division of the Connecticut North Men’s Senior Baseball League, will be wearing new baseball hats that include a custom-made patch that pays tribute to Lt.
