<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team pounded out eleven hits, seven for extra bases, and got solid pitching and defense, as they defeated Windsor Locks by the score of 10-0 on Friday. The game was&nbsp;played at Veterans Memorial Park in Windsor Locks.</p>

<p>Eastern’s Caleb Molinsky pitched the complete game win, allowing just two singles, while walking three and striking out eight. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Molinsky walked the first two batters of the game, then got a strikeout and a double play to retire the side, and followed that up by setting down the Windsor Locks hitters in order from the second through the fifth innings.&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave up a walk in the sixth, and an infield single in the seventh, and that was all the right-hander allowed.</p>

<p>Offensively, the Lancers scored a run in the second on an error, and then hammered the ball in the next two innings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the third frame, following two walks, Rio Fernandez hit a long three-run home run over the left field fence to put Eastern ahead 4-0. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, in the fourth inning, Gabe White and Cole Chaivanik opened the frame with singles. &nbsp;Ben D’Amato doubled in White, and Owen Myers&nbsp;followed with a double&nbsp;to right center scoring Chaivanik and D’Amato. &nbsp;Fernandez then doubled to right center to score Myers with Eastern’s fourth run of the inning, and Eastern now up 8-0.</p>

<p>Eastern’s final runs came in the seventh, with Anthony Nocera doubling in Matthew Harkey and Drew Martineau who had each walked to open the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers finished the game with two doubles and a single, two runs batted in and two runs scored. &nbsp;Fernandez had the double and homer for four rbi’s, and&nbsp;D’Amato &nbsp;had a single and double, scoring a run and driving in a run.</p>
