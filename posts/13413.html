<p>The Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern softball teams go to battle for the final time this season in a city series confrontation from the BEHS softball field on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (16-3) are in the mix for a berth in the CCC Tournament while the Lancers (10-9) hope to improve their playoff positioning in the Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first showdown between the squads, Central scored a 3-1 victory against Eastern back on May 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads are coming into the game off tough losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central took on state power Southington on Wednesday, dropping a tough 8-0 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Sklenka had two hits to pace Central’s offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that very same Wednesday, Eastern fell in a rare home loss in Bristol, falling to Maloney by a 4-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ali Tellier once again held her own in the circle while Sam Policki tallied another multi-hit game for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad gave up two runs in the sixth inning as Maloney’s edge was just 2-1 to that point of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney, one of the top squads in the CCC south, moved to 14-5 off the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isabelle Smith allowed seven hits, struck out eight and walked just two to earn the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the story of the game was Eastern freshman Madi Foerstch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She nabbed her first varsity hit - smashing out a two-base hit to keep the Lancers in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter who Central puts in the circle, Alex Sciarretto or Sophia Torreso, it’s going to be an all-out war as Tellier is on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This should be another classic as either team could win this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Senior Night for BE</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest on Friday also marks the final scholastic home games for Bristol Eastern seniors Grace D’Amato, Ali Tellier, Alex Shorette, Janessa Gonzalez, Sarah Snedeker and Sam Policki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group will be honored prior to the start of the game.</p>
