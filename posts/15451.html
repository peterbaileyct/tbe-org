<p>The Bristol Blues ended their 2022 regular season on a four game winning streak as the locals defeated the Danbury Westerners by a 3-1 final on the road from Rogers Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues tallied a 32-12 overall ledger -- 20 games over .500 -- to end the campaign, winning the West Division of the New England Collegiate Baseball League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues ended the season 10.5 games in front of Danbury (21-22) to scoop up the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final regular season contest for Bristol saw 603 fans witness the Westerners scoop up a 1-0 push through five innings of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol struck back for one run in the top of the sixth and a couple more in the seventh to snare the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Billy Sullivan went 2-of-4 with a double and an RBI while Tyler Forte also blasted out a two-base tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues outhit Danbury 7-3 as Tommy Hughes won the contest for Bristol on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw just one inning, walked two and struck out one to earn the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a run, Sullivan’s two-base hit in the sixth scored Forte to tie things up at 1-1 before the fateful seventh stanza came to pass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Forte returned the favor in the seventh as he blasted out his two-RBI double -- plating Jack Lynch and Ben Huber -- to help the Blues snare a 3-1 edge in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several Bristol pitchers threw a single inning towards the end of the showdown and Peter Phillips chucked a perfect 1-2-3 frame as three straight Ks sealed the deal for the Blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With its victory over Danbury, Bristol ended up the only program from the West Division to finish over .500.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues tied for the best record in the league this year along with the Vermont Mountaineers (32-12).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NECBL playoffs commence this coming week.</p>
