<p>HEBRON -- The Bristol Central boys basketball team opened the 2023-24 season against RHAM on Saturday afternoon - the first of three straight road games to start the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for a young squad, that’s not an easy way to start things in the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central gave it a whirl, leading after one period of play before the bottom fell out right before the half as the Raptors hung on to snare a 65-48 victory in Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM (2-0) trailed big early before Central (0-1) went into a bit of a shooting slump, never recovering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s hard to win a game on the road if you shoot under 15-percent from 3,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “I know in the second half, we were 4-for-21 on two-pointers. For the game, we shot 37-percent from twos, 20-percent from three and sixty percent from the line.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors hit nine three-pointers overall, all coming over the final 22 minutes of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central couldn’t miss early as the team went right to work offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Melo Thompson (15 points, nine rebounds) hit eight points of Central’s 13-2 run to start the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey McMahon (11 points, eight rebounds) hit a free throw, Joey Pikiell nabbed a runner in the lane and when Quincy Lawson found Nate Ortiz for a lay-up, Central was in charge at 13-6 through one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Left, Carmelo Thompson takes it to the hoop. Right, Harry Ross jump ball. | Herve</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second stanza, Harry Ross (seven points) slipped in a hoop that gave the Rams a 17-10 lead with 6:08 before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the bottom fell out on the visitors as RHAM hit five three-pointers - including a four-point play by the Raptors’ Troy Miller (20 points) with the last 3 from Connor Sullivan making it a 26-24 game in RHAM’s favor at the 3:52 mark of the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawson added a hoop off a slick pass from Thompson with 2:55 in the second quarter, helping Central draw even at 26-26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That stalemate didn’t last long as the Raptors notched eight straight points to end the second period and scored the first two hoops of third as the home team captured a 38-26 edge with 21 seconds gone in the second half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They shot the ball well, give them a little bit of credit,” said Barrette of RHAM. “Their role players played much better tonight in their second game of varsity action than they did on Thursday [against Coventry] when I scouted them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With that being said, I think my guys will too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ross scored the first three points for Central in the third and when Thompson dropped in a 3, the Rams were hanging around, trailing 44-32 with 3:54 left to play in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But off all that tough shooting, offense was at a premium for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have three guys that have ever played a varsity game,” said Barrette. “Starting out with whomever scheduled me to have three road games in a row, whoever put me on the road three straight games to start my season, with three varsity returners, it’s not easy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’ve got to learn…it’s trial by fire.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s defense kept the team in the contest towards the tail end of the third period, allowing nothing in terms of offense over the final 3:37 and off one final lay-in from Thompson, RHAM’s lead was 47-34.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McMahon opened the fourth with a baseline 3 and with 6:45 to play, the Rams were hanging around, trailing 48-37.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors’ Brady Hullano (14 points) drained a 3 to match the McMahon basket as Central wasn’t able to get it back down to single digits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring, Ross cashed in on an offensive rebound, Jaysun Dominguez added a lay-up, McMahon and Dominguez combined for four free throws and Cody Roy blasted in a 3 but the Raptors grabbed a 17-point win to end the game - moving to 2-0 on the young campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought our effort was good,” said Barrette. “It wasn’t about lack of effort. But in the game of basketball, we couldn’t stop a run tonight. And that’s what I told the guys. You’ve got to be able to stop a run, especially on the road and every time we made a good move or got a look, we missed a lay-up or we missed an open three.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s hard to win a game that way.”</p>
