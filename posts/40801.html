<p>Come Sunday morning, one of our kids will have celebrated birthday No. 37--a big day, spent hanging out with the kids at home. Sounds kind of nice. The week overall has been slow, some meetings to cover, a babysitting gig. Then, there is the crazy weather. All those solar panels -- sitting on roofs across the city under dark skies--idle. </p>

<p>This most fun the past week was taking two of the grandkids, ages 2 and 3, respectively, to the Fire Museum at the Carousel Museum on Sunday afternoon. The youngest is a fire-truck aficionado, he loves all things truck- and car-related. Richard Scarry could not find a better audience for his "Things that Move" classic. The 3-year-old loves gadgets, switches and things to turn so he had plenty to occupy him.</p>

<p>When the interest began to wane, we moved to the mini-carousel that is on the first floor and the kids play area. The carousel was good for a few spins. The kids play area, well, it was closing time, the lights flickered a few times, and the kids were still busy with the blocks. Good times!</p>

<p>Last week, the Finance Board approved funding for the Northeast Middle School Project and Firehouse 3 in Forestville. Both have been forwarded to a meeting of the Joint Board next month.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week begins with a CT Public radio show, "Where We Live," whose topic is "Connecticut is the land of steady habits, but no steady identity." It includes a lively discussion led by host Catherine Shen and guests Colin McEnroe, host of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/show/the-colin-mcenroe-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Colin McEnroe Show</a>; Chion Wolf, host of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/show/audacious-with-chion-wolf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audacious with Chion Wolf</a>; and Dr. Khalilah Brown-Dean, host of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/show/disrupted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disrupted</a>. Their conversation was followed with another conversation with Dr. Jonathan Wharton, <a href="https://www.southernct.edu/directory/whartonj1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Associate Professor of Political Science and Urban Affairs</a>, Southern Connecticut State University, and columnist,&nbsp;<a href="https://ctnewsjunkie.com/author/jonathan-l-wharton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT News Junkie</a>&nbsp;and Hearst Connecticut.</p>

<p>Getting some other perspectives on the place I have lived my entire life is eye opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In keeping with that theme, of identity, how about the role of memory? A second podcast, "The Hidden Brain," features psychologist Elizabeth Loftus on an episode, entitled "Are Your Memories Real?" This one might send you into a tailspin. But, again, it's helpful to know more than less about memory and how it plays out.</p>

<p>For reading, I picked up "Echoing Silence: Thomas Merton on the Vocation of Writing," edited by Robert Inchausti. The book was sitting on a bookshelf and caught my eye. Skimming through it, I found such passages as this one about Albert Camus, a favorite of mine: "The 'human task,' he said, was ' a humble and limited one: to find those few words by which to appease the infinite anguish of free souls.' Of course he meant more than the phrase says by itself. He was concerned with the power of language--of truth then--to protect man [sic] against ferocity, murder, nihilism, chaos."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This makes me wonder of the wisdom of turning over our own writing to A.I., in so many words, letting it do the work that has up to this point been considered "the human task," in all of its and our imperfections. Just a thought.</p>

<p>One reader, after reading about measles outbreaks in the Northeast, writes wondering what if anything local officials are planning in the event of a measles outbreak here--since vaccinations appear to be a sticking point for some parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As a child of the polio era, I am thankful my parents never questioned the public health authorities, thus saving us from leg braces, iron lungs or worse."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any thoughts? </p>

<p>We are glad to be doing what we can to cover what is happening locally, and grateful for those who support our efforts. As we attract more supporters, we will be covering more of the city–and developing a corps of reporters who we can pay for their services. We want to encourage young people from our community, who have an interest in telling Bristol stories and improving their skills to do this. If you are one of these people, or know of one, please contact&nbsp;<a href="http://dfortier@bristoledition.org./">dfortier@bristoledition.org.</a></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
