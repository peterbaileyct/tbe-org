<p>Both meetings will be held in the City Hall West Meeting Rm. 1, 131 N. Main St. The first will begin at 5:30 p.m. The second will follow immediately. If the board approves the projected budget, it will come before the Joint Board, comprised of the finance board and the city council, at its next meeting Tuesday, May 9. </p>

<p>This year's mill rate will be 20 percent less than last year's because of the property revaluations, according to a video provided by the assessor's office. However, the average increase in housing values have risen 35 percent, which led to the need to decrease the mil rate.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
