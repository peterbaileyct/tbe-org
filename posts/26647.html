<p>After Kiluk retired the Naugatuck hitters in order in the top of the 1st, the St Paul offense got things rolling in the bottom of the frame. Jamie Leggett led off with a single, and promptly stole 2nd. Cole Raymond reached on an infield error that allowed Leggett to advance to 3rd. Raymond stole 2nd to put two men in scoring position, and catcher Cal Chance brought them both home with a two RBI single. Chance was able to score on the second error of the inning that allowed Ryan Kilpatrick to reach safely. Jonathan Remillard singled, and both he and Kilpatrick scored on AJ Corrado's two RBI single. The Falcons batted around, and led 5-0 after one inning.</p>
