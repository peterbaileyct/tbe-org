<p>On the evening of Oct. 25, lifelong Bristol resident, Ronald (Ron) George Wagner, born on Sept. 1, 1941, to George and Flora Wagner, was granted eternal peace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An electrician by trade, Ron provided a steady stream of positive energy to his local community and beyond. He married his forever love, Jo-Ann Santos Wagner, on Aug. 28, 1965, and spent the remaining entirety of his life, honored to be by her side.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He leaves behind an abundant trove of beautiful memories, and a masters class on the art of kind and selfless living, to his adult children, Kathy Paniati, with husband Clayton Paniati, Ronald Wagner, with wife Bernadette Wagner, and Tracy Norton, with husband Matthew Norton, as well as beloved grandchildren, Cody Varkal, Halle Wagner, Caroline Norton, Angel Wagner, and Alana Wagner.</p>

<p>Over the course of a lifetime, Ronald George Wagner climbed mountains, built kites, sailed seas, created art, overcame obstacles, laughed at his own jokes, continually evolved, set up Christmas trees, learned new skills, sought out good music, laughed at others’ jokes, kept an open mind, strived to be better every day, ate ice cream, taught by example, showed kindness and empathy, flew kites, sacrificed for others, separated M&amp;Ms by color, loved God, loved his wife, cherished his children and grandchildren, and quietly cultivated an enduring legacy of family, friends, and neighbors, who won’t ever forget the gentle but profound impact he had on their lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among them are Barbara and Jim Cote, Eileen and Jerry Fusari, Barbara and Dick McKenney, George Sullivan, and Roger Bartholomew. Ron considered every friend a close friend, and we wish we could list you all. A self-described “young kid just trying to make good,” Ron “DIG” Wagner, rose to his own challenge, and by all pertinent accounts, couldn’t possibly have been more successful.<br>He was loved, and he will be forever missed. Thank you for the opportunity to love you, Dad.</p>

<p>Ron’s family extends gratitude to Bristol Health Homecare and Hospice for the compassionate and respectful care provided by Katie, Judith, Clara, and Les. We offer thanks to his caregiver, Rosie, who brought many smiles to his face over the last several months and to neighbor turned family, Frank Gonzalez who took my parents under his kind and gentle wing. Frank’s presence gave our family comfort at times when we could not be present.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
