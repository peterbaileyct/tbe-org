<p>The Bristol Central boys track and field team has enjoyed a tremendous postseason this June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And from New Britain to Bangor (Maine) to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, athletes from all over Bristol were performing from those venues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the recent CIAC Decathlon &amp; Heptathlon Championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain, Bristol Central’s Kevin Whitford took part in all the events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he made big gains at the event, moving up from the ranks to finish in 22<sup>nd</sup> place overall to end a very trying series of races – spanning two days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kenny Whitford is the man,” said Central boys coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk via Twitter. “[He] moved up from 27<sup>th</sup> to finish the CT Decathlon in 22<sup>nd</sup> place. Once again, I’m so proud of this guy for taking a chance on himself and trying a grueling two day event.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whitford did well in the pole vault, clearing 10 feet, six inches for eighth place while his high jump finish of five feet, six inches was good for 11th overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also had to run the 100 meters (12.55 seconds) as well as the 110 meter hurdles, 1500 meter race and took several events in the field head on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whitford is a talented junior who could be poised for a very big season for the track programs at the school in 2023-24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But also involved in the postseason was Central’s Patrick Wininger, squaring off against all the competition in the boys 2000 Meter Steeplechase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he was impressive, finishing in fifth place overall with a time of 6:50.39.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hale Ray’s Matthew Kraszewski won the challenge (6:32.69) while Trumbull’s Harjaap Singh (6:33:51) wasn’t far behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“Patrick Wininger with a strong fifth place showing at the CT 2K Steeplecase,” said Stafford-Kirk. “[He’s] another one of our guys taking a chance in a new event.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior, an excellent distance runner, can take another shot at the event next season when his senior campaign rolls around.</p>
