<p>It’s official as the CIAC has just released its 2022 CIAC Girls basketball state tournament pairings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a year off from the postseason favorite due to the pandemic, the tournament is back on and in the Class L bracket, Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern are both in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will start first round play with a familiar opponent while the Lancers have to travel down Interstate 84 for its postseason opener against an unknown assailant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, ranked 16<sup>th</sup> in the fray (10-10 overall), will get one more shot against Platt (No. 17, 10-10) in what has turned into a rubber match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South opponents split the season series 1-1 with each program winning on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 11, Central dropped a close 47-34 decision and in the rematch on February 1, the Rams came away big 44-34 winners in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will the final encounter, from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol, bring the Rams a little luck against the pesky Panthers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an 0-7 start, Central has been on absolute fire – winning 10 of 13 games to end the regular season – as Lillian Sirois (14.7 points-per-game), sharp-shooter Brooke Watson (9.8 ppg, 15 three-pointers) and Ariana Rivera (9.1 ppg) will lead the charge against the Panthers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest between the squads commences this coming Monday at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on that same day, Eastern travels down to Bethel High School in a first round tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bethel was 12-8 in regular season play this year while the twenty-first ranked Lancers start the Class L tournament with an 8-12 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wildcats are from a strong Southwest Conference division – playing mostly against teams in the Fairfield Country area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither squad played against any like opponents this year but expect Bethel to be an excellent test for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern brings in senior star Ciara Collins (24.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 2.7 steals-per-game) and that’s who the Wildcats must contain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow CCC South All-Conference selections Janessa Gonzalez (8.9 points, 8.7 rebounds-per-game) and Taigan Parent will also be looking forward to the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four squads got byes in the Class L tilt this year as the CIAC did not use the fill the bracket method to fill all the slots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top ranked squad is Newington (19-1 regular season) and if Central can pass its first round test against Platt, the Nor’easters are waiting in the wings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, if Eastern can sneak by Bethel, a possible date against No. 5 Edwin O. Smith or No. 28 Kennedy is in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the season, Smith defeated Eastern 61-50 and boasts good size and plenty of talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central or Eastern advances, second round play commences on March 4 at 6:30 p.m.</p>
