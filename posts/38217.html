<p>A new early childcare and education facility celebrated its grand opening on Lake Avenue last week with addresses by the organization's executive director, a parent with children in the program, a classroom teacher and the board president.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"For the first time ever, early HeadStart services are available to families and children in the Bristol Community," said Human Resources Agency (HRA) of New Britain executive director Dr. Marlo Greponne.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This is a huge win for the community because Early HeadStart means comprehensive services for children under the age of three, infants and toddlers, from low-income families that wouldn't normally receive this level of care, free of charge, full day and full year, by a dedicated staff right here in their local community, which is a beautiful thing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HRA provides services throughout the greater New Britain area, and this program fills a gap in Bristol. HRA took over the previous community action agency in Bristol, Bristol Community Organization (BCO) several years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HRA is dedicated to increasing economic self-sufficiency among individuals and families by providing services from early childhood education to employment and training to elderly assistance.</p>

<p><em>The new classrooms at the HRA childcare facility off Lake Avenue feature child-sized furniture, including toilets and sinks in the bathrooms, and play areas designed specifically for children. | David Fortier</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The facility is located on Lake Avenue, between the former Artificial Flower Shop and Zbikowski Park, a public housing project serving low-income families. The HRA Early Learning Center has spaces for 36 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years and 16 children between 4 months and 3 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's beautifully setup," Greponne said, qualifying this statement. "Unfortunately, it's not completely full, not for lack of interest and families that are ready and waiting for the service but because of the staffing shortage that's happening in all across the communities that we serve and in the state in general."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She made a pitch to anyone interested in a career in childcare to inquire about joining the HRA team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent Stacia Chase has three children that have been through the HRA early childhood program, with one who is still enrolled. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I've been here from the beginning," she said. "This building, first and foremost, is beautiful."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She commented on the increased play space, both in the classrooms and in the playground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's more secure, private for the children. It's safer. The program is excellent. I will swear by it and they learn so much. They're absolutely school-ready to go to kindergarten. The teachers are great. I love them."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teacher Tara Mobian shared a story about one student, who was struggling with potty training before coming to the new HRA location, but who, shortly after arriving, succeeded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Within in a week, she was potty trained," Mobian said, crediting the children-sized facilities in the bathrooms with helping the process along.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm just saying, comfortability makes a difference," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HRA board president and State Rep. Mary Fortier said, "The joy that this facility is bringing to this little corner of Bristol is incredible."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We know that bringing people out of poverty, you know the number one thing is education and having kids that are ready and love education. It starts now. And there is nothing more important we can do as a society than to give people educational opportunities."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She referred to another HRA project that is just underway next to the early childhood learning center where the flower shop had been. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without getting ahead of things, she said, "We're going to have other services there, so when families come here to bring their children and they need help with their energy assistance or some other program, those services are going to be right next door."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The early learning center was funded with a $1.3 million federal grant from HeadStart. The Lake Avenue building has four classrooms: an Early HeadStart Infant room; an Early Head Start Toddler room;  a community room; a Head Start classroom; and a second Head Start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The facility features a nature-based design with tones of green, for a tranquil and peaceful environment that promotes mental well-being and concentration. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The building also features security enhancements, such as tinted windows with security film, exterior and interior security cameras, and secure access doors, ensuring children's and staff's safety.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
