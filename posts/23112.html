<p>Tonight, in Bristol, beginning at 6:47 p.m., if you position yourself outside and cast your gaze low on the horizon from West to Northeast, you will see 55 dots streaking across the sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dots in question are not UFOs, UPAs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), or even a Chinese spy balloons or rather “civilian airships” that just happened to have electronic surveillance technology. No. They are in fact, a train of satellites known as the Starlink satellite network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Starlink satellites designed by SpaceX&nbsp;were developed to provide low-cost internet to remote locations, and they orbit 342 miles above Earth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You do not need any special equipment because they will be visible to the naked eye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The satellites will initially appear from the West and traverse the sky eastbound until they disappear in the Northeast portion of the sky. They will be visible 10° above the horizon and reach a maximum elevation of 64°.</p>

<p>The show will last nearly five minutes.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
