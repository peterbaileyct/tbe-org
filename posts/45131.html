<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team defeated Middletown on Monday, winning by the score of 7-<br>3, in a game played at Muzzy Field.</p>

<p>Eastern pitcher Anthony Nocera pitched the complete game win, scattering eight hits, walking<br>one, and striking out seven. Nocera gave up a run in the top of the first, and then sailed until<br>the Blue Dragons scored two in the sixth on three consecutive hits.</p>

<p>Trailing 1-0, the Lancers scored three runs in the bottom of the third inning. Caleb Molinsky<br>opened the inning with a single to right center. White then doubled to left center, putting runners<br>on second and third. Chaivanik grounded to third and the throw to first went wild scoring both<br>Molinsky and White. Myers followed with a single to left driving in Chaivanik with Eastern’s<br>third run of the inning.</p>
