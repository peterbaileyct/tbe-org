<p>The family and friends of the late Bristol physician, Paul Mastropolo, M.D. are seeking to contact any group members who may have played with the ensemble when Paul was a saxophonist with the group. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul participated with the B.B.&amp; W. from the time that they practiced in the old "Michaels Jewelry" store in the now long demolished Bristol Centre Mall ( ??? 1998/1999 ???) until the time of theÂ  death of his wife, Laurie, in 2019.</p>

<p>Any members of the musical group who played with Paul may contact me. I thank you for any assistance that you can provide.</p>
