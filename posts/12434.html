<p>PLAINVILLE - The Bristol Eastern boys track and field team stepped up against an extremely strong squad from Plainville on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Blue Devils took the meet over a 98-52 triumph in a CCC South entanglement from Tinty Track and Field at Plainville High School.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won two of the three relay events as Eastern dominated both the 4x800 and 4x400 races.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x800, the combination of Logan Crowley, Aidan Tartarelli, Dominic Tartarelli, and Carter Harris earned first place in 8:44.4 and then in the 4x800, Harris was a winner once again.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, Carter joined Axel Agustin Santiago, Edward Ansah, and Preston Poirier in the 4x400 - seizing the winning time in 3:49.34.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Crowley and Harris weren’t finished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowley nabbed first place in the 1600 (4:54) and 3200 meters (10:27) while Harris won the pole vault (8-06) and 800 meters (2:09).</p>
