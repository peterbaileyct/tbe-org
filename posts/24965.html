<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern boys track &amp; field team is now 2-for-2 on the season after flipping Plainville by an 88-62 final over a CCC South confrontation on Thursday from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>

<p>Eastern had multiple winners at the event, including Dominic Tartarelli who won the 1600 meters (4:57) and made up part of the winning 4x800 meter relay team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayshon Andrews (100 meters, 11.2 seconds; 200 meters, 22.42 seconds) was a dual individual winner and also nabbed first place with the 4x100 meter relay squad.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
