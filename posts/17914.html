<p>The Bristol Eastern girls cross country program split against Middletown and Platt on Monday afternoon from Hubbard Park in Meriden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons topped the Lancers by a 20-35 final while Eastern took it to the Panthers, 15-50.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And per usual, a certain freshman phenom from Eastern’s squad was able to top all the competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Kaelyn Gonzalez ran strong coming in first place overall with a time of 20:22,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “Lauren Ayotte also had a strong day coming in 11th place with a time of 24:58.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then on the flip side, the boys were able to sweep all the competition in Meriden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters were able to hang duplicate 15-50 losses on both Middletown and Platt as the boys from Eastern are having a very good season with a competitor from King Street ultimately winning the race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Dominic Tartarelli runs a gritty race and comes in first with a time of 18:26,” said Ryskowski. Jack Mulcunry celebrated his birthday with a second place finish of 18:44 while several other Eastern runners crossed the finish line soon after. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Bristol Eastern boys packed it up behind [Tartarelli and Mulcunry] with strong races from Aidan Tartarelli, Brendan Tartarelli, Dylan Prince, Cole Beland, and Aidan Gezelman,” said Ryskowski. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastern’s final regular season challenge comes on Thursday, October 13 when all three high schools in town meet up for the annual city series challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, Eastern joins Bristol Central to run the course over at St. Paul Catholic High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
