<p>What a difference a year makes for the Bristol Eastern football program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a winless batch of games that flowed into the bye week last season, it’s a completely different situation in 2023 as the Kingstreeters start the second half of the season at a sterling 4-1 overall -- looking for more when regular season games recommence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s definitely a different story here this year,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “Last year, we were 0-5 at the halfway point. This year, we’re 4-1. And it’s a credit to the kids.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense has ruled the season for the Lancers, with two shutouts over the past three games, fueling the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Eastern on the road, opponents have yet to score a point as teams have had trouble scoring against an aggressive, saturating defense by the locals.</p>

<p>Take away the 21 points South Windsor scored over its 7-point upset of the Lancers on Sept. 29 (21-14) and there hasn’t been much in terms of points by opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opposition averages less than 10 points-per-game (9.6 ppg) and has thrown six interceptions on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our defense paced us the whole first half of the season,” said Julius. “Even in our one loss to South Windsor, we only gave up three scores. The defense has been really, really good all year long.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of those interceptions belong to Mr. Everything, Adam Zavecz, who scored on both those pickoff attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Corvo and Bryce Bacote have two interceptions apiece while Zavecz leads the squad in tackles (37) and headaches by the opponents (four).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hunter Wells is a bulldog, capturing two of Eastern’s three sacks, and is second on the squad in tackles-for-losses yardage (eight yards lost).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey Sherrill has seven tackles for losses (16.5 yards) while Jaiden Fore, Alex Corvo, Lincoln Bashaw and Ryan Zavecz all have multiple tackles-for-losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s opponents have struggled with the ball, capturing just over four yards-per-play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents have cashed in on just 27 percent of its third down attempts and misfired on 13 fourth down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s secondary has allowed opposing quarterbacks to a 48-completion percentage and in terms of rushing, the Lancers have stopped several teams cold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 137 attempts, the opposition have raced out for just 425 yards (3.1 yards-per-carry) and just three rushing touchdowns -- all scored by South Windsor during Week 4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A big help has been the infusion of former St. Paul Catholic standout Daija Fitzpatrick -- proving to be a tremendous lift for the BEHS coaching staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The players have bought into the concepts Fitzpatrick preaches but it’s the kids who put that ability on display on most Friday nights (and on Thursdays and an occasional Saturday).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kids have done a great job. They’ve really bought into the offseason,” said Julius. “They’ve gotten themselves physically stronger and prepared themselves to play. The coaching staff, the assistant coaches have done a really good job in preparing them week in and week out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s a solid offensive attack, fueled by the play of Fore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior back is well on his way to a 1000-yard season with over 600 yards in the bank along with six rushing touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give credit to Adam Zavecz and Randy DeNoto in helping Fore find seams and cracks to rush through for additional yardage while that group aids junior QB Kamden Laprise in the passing schemes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health has been a big issue for Eastern over the years and Laprise has been injury free, and his leadership, athletic ability and guile were a missing ingredient for the Kingstreeters over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He completes 54 percent of his passes, tossed just one interception to date, and has made two connections of over 75 yards this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His targets have included Chase Dauphinee (nine passes, 149 yards), Zion Otero (two touchdowns) and Fore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This squad is truly playing some impressive team ball and currently, the Lancers are in 11th place in the Class MM standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal is to keep winning, understand the team concept and play for each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the team can continue to bring those elements into the next five games, a possible postseason berth could be in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But first, it’s a huge CCC Tier III challenge against Platt (Friday, 6 p.m.) as two squads with identical 4-1 records clash from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Like we talked about in the preseason, we wanted to be in every game we played and so far, we’ve done that,” said Julius. “Now it’s the second half. Now it’s about getting right by the bye week, getting healthy and staying right.”</p>
