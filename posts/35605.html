<p>The Western Connecticut State University Women’s soccer program has a brand new all-time leading scorer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s former Bristol Eastern goal scoring machine Myah Croze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior competitor has been a fixture of the WestConn lineup since leaving the Lancers’ program and did not skip a beat at the collegiate level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Wednesday against Little East rival Eastern Connecticut State University, Croze notched the game-winning goal as Western zipped up a 1-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory propelled the squad to a 7-4-4 ledger overall while the team had yet to lose in Little East play (4-0-1) to that point of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal against Eastern Connecticut gave her 148 career points, a new school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the 67 career goals produced by the crafty Croze gives her the all-time lead in that category as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Eastern, she tallied that goal in the 78th minute of the match to propel her squad to another triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 5-ft.-2 in. senior from Bristol is an impressive force in the midfield and has a cannon for a foot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When No. 29 in the WestConn program decides to unleash a rocket from 30-40 yards out, Croze has the ability to connect and score from that deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad has been playing extremely well to date and when Croze and WestConn squared off against Worcester State on Oct. 4, the goal scoring machine tallied a hat trick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wolves won the contest 6-0 from the Westside Athletic Complex in Danbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wolves have scored 42 total goals this season and Croze has been responsible for 12 of those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also added an assist to the till while starting all 16 games for the program over 1,048 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze scored 25 points to date while taking 34 shots on goal -- notching two game winners in the process which are all team-leading totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season as a junior, Croze was a Little East All-Conference First Team, played in every match for WestConn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She led the Wolves in game-winning goals for third place in the LEC and tallied the 15th most in nation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze was second on her squad in goals scored (fourth in LEC), assists, scoring (also fourth in LEC) and shots taken (second in LEC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She took home Little East Conference Fall All-Academic Team accolades and was named to the Little East Conference Academic Honor Roll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Bristol Eastern, Croze was a goal-scoring machine at the forward position, earning All-State honors twice while securing CCC South All-Conference honors every season she played for the Kingstreeters.</p>
