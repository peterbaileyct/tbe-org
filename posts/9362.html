<p>Well, it’s the final week of the postseason in scholastic volleyball and the program from Bristol Eastern is still in the mix - making an outstanding playoff run in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers, winners of nine matches in a row (21-5), have been a tremendous Class L contender - the tenth ranked team in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to its 3-0 march through the bracket, it’s time for a little Central Connecticut Conference Tournament Finals rematch from November 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Squaring off against No. 10 Eastern will be No. 11 Simsbury (20-6) who dropped a 3-1 decision to the Lancers in the CCC Tournament title match (24-26, 25-17, 25-20, and 25-18).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rematch takes place Wednesday at 6 p.m. from Northwest Catholic high school in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is more than ready for the challenge, defeating the Trojans that evening in their own gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that title bout, Eastern’s Hannah Webber dropped in 35 kills while Lauren Bender swung down 16.</p>

<p>Alex Shorette flipped in two kills and three assists while bumping up 13 digs, Abby Jones added 44 assists and six aces while Alyssa Adorno (three aces, six digs), Sarah Lacouture (nine digs), and Emily Valentine (five aces) all provided huge support in the victory over Simsbury.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it’s the all-important rematch with the winner moving on to ‘Championship Saturday’ against either top-seeded RHAM or No. 5 North Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has not lost a set in Class L tournament play while top ranked RHAM dropped one game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury has three set losses this postseason. - including two in the quarterfinal victory over No. 3 East Lyme (25-23, 25-21, 17-25, 19-25, and 15-13).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a huge deal as the Lancers are attempting to qualify for the Class L championship game for the first time since 2012 when Eastern turned away East Lyme, 3-0, to win it all.&nbsp;</p>
