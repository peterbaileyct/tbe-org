<p>BRISTOL, Connecticut – Coming off a comeback victory for the ages, the Bristol Mustangs are looking to make even more team history this weekend at the town’s most historic baseball venue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mustangs meet eight-time defending champion Hebron in the semifinals of the Connecticut North Men’s Senior Baseball League 35-plus division playoffs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best-of-three series starts Saturday with two games at Muzzy Field, beginning at 10 a.m. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If necessary, a third game will be played on Sunday at RHAM High School in Hebron at 10 a.m.<br><br>The winner between Bristol and Hebron will play the winner of the other semifinal series between Clinton and Rocky Hill in the championship round Aug. 19-20.</p>

<p>The Mustangs (11-9), on the strength of some late-game heroics, advanced to the semifinal round for the fifth consecutive year last Saturday with a playoff-opening, two-game sweep of the Ledyard Angels. Bristol won the first game, 7-1, behind the pitching of ace Jesse Darcy, who struck out 10 and allowed only six hits.</p>

<p><br>The second game, however, produced the Mustangs’ greatest-ever comeback. Ledyard led 8- 2 and needed only three outs to force a Game 3 on Sunday, but Bristol rallied to score seven runs in the bottom of the seventh inning -- the final two coming home on David Blake’s looping single to center field -- as the Mustangs walked off with a dramatic 9-8 victory.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, they have yet another opportunity against powerful Hebron. The Mustangs, who have never beaten the Hops in a playoff game over the past three years, went 1-3 against them during the regular season, handing Hebron its only defeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Due to some key roster additions, the Mustangs have higher hopes of finally overcoming the Hops and advancing to the championship round for the first time. They added a former minor league pitcher in Darcy, slick-fielding shortstop Mike Capone and infielder/outfielder Joe Santagata, to go with a strong core of returning All-Stars that includes three Bristol natives – center fielder Bryan Webster, left fielder Ryan Brayne, and pitcher Dave Michaud – along with catcher Scott Vibert and third baseman Anthony Parrino.</p>

<p><br>Playing their sixth season in Bristol, the Mustangs dedicated the 2023 campaign to the memory of the two fallen Bristol police officers – Lt. Dustin DeMonte (who was Webster’s cousin) and Sgt. Alex Hamzy – who lost their lives in the line of duty on Oct. 12, 2022. They wear commemorative patches on the back of their hats as a tribute to them and the Bristol Police Department.</p>
