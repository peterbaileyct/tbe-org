<p>The Bristol Central wrestling team battled Maloney this past Wednesday, hanging in against the CCC South power. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams made gains throughout the evening but ended up dropping a tough 37-27 decision from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was certainly more than competitive but the Spartans did just enough to move to 2-0 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a double-forfeit at 106 pounds but at 120, Central picked up six points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaden Dragon pinned Maloney’s Mohammed Ramlek in 3:13 while at 126, the multi-skilled Alex Lamarre won against Daren Johnson – seizing a 5-4 decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Joseph Niek (132) pinned Dontae Smith in 3:30 as the locals had success over the lightweight divisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 150 pounds, Aiden Lamarre pinned the Spartans Ezequiel Acevedo in 3:45 while the 157 bout saw Lincoln Archibald seize victory yet again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a very aggressive showdown, Archibald was able to defeat Devan Bacote via pinfall (1:41).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in action for Central that day were Maleeah Rios (113), Julian Colon (138), Derek Sedlak (144), Alexander Zolla (165), Jayden Colon (175), Jack Jones (190), Cole Krueger (215) and Michael Jones (285).</p>
