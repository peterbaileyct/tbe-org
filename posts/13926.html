<p>NEW BRITAIN - While the Bristol Eastern boys track and field program did not tally a point at the CIAC Boys Outdoor Track and Field State Open event on Monday afternoon, one of the program’s relay teams made a very impressive showing in New Britain.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the 4x800 meter relay team from Eastern put together a school record shattering time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Logan Crowley, Jack Mulcunry, Dominic Tartarelli, and Carter Harris broke the Eastern record in the event with a finish of 8:08.81 as Eastern placed ninth overall in the race.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers relay squad just missed out scoring a point as Simsbury placed eighth in 8:08.43 which was just a hair better than Eastern’s eventual finish.</p>

<p>Edwin O. Smith won the race with a time of 7:57.48.</p>

<p>Crowley also took part of the 3200 meter race, placing 21st overall with a finish of 10:31.47 to pace the Lancers in New Britain.</p>

<p>Crowley, Mulcunry, Dominic Tartarelli, and Harris were a strong group of student athletes that represented the Lancers’ program outdoor track and field program very well from the CIAC State Open.</p>
