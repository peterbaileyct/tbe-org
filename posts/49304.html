<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August is now here! With these new upcoming events, get ready to stock up on some items, August will set summer ablaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This upcoming community day is a classic. Pokémon GO’s August Community Day Classic featured Pokémon is Beldum! During this day, Trainers a have an opportunity to evolve to a Metagross that knows the Steel type charged attack Meteor Mash. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be appearing more frequently in the wild. If you’re lucky, you may encounter a Shiny one! Complete event-themed field research rewarding encounters with Beldum, Pokéballs, Stardust and more. This Community Day Classic takes place on Sunday, Aug. 18, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

<p>Just a reminder for the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Times</strong><br>Moltres – Aug. 3-12<br>Thundurus- Aug. 12-21<br>Xerneas – Aug. 2 to Sept. 3<br>Mega Aerodactyl -- Aug. 3-12<br>Mega Kangaskhan - Aug. 12-21<br>Mega Salamence- Aug. 21 to Sept. 3</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Locations</strong><br>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, the new Shadow Lugia is happening this week! Shadow Lugia can be defeated with five – six trainers, but if you cannot guarantee the top counters with maxed-out CP and the best moves, your best bet is to make sure you have four or more players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fewer players will be needed if Purified Gems are used on Shadow Lugia. Using the Circle Lock Technique to guarantee Great or Excellent throws, along with Golden Razz Berries, is the best way to catch Pokémon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you get a Shiny, though, it is a guaranteed catch so be sure to use a Pinap Berry. Shadow Lugia's maximum Combat Power stat is 4186 CP, and its best Pokémon GO moves are Extrasensory and Aeroblast. Shadow Lugia is weak to Dark, Electric, Ghost, Ice, and Rock moves. It is strong against Grass, Psychic, Fighting, and Ground moves.</p>

<p>Starts:<br>Saturday, Aug. 10, at 6 a.m.<br>Ends:<br>Sunday, Aug. 11, at 10 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
