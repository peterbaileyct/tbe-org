<p>UNCASVILLE – After an outstanding 2021 campaign on the hardwood, the Bristol Central boys basketball team knew what it could do with a full slate of games at its disposal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with the raging pandemic, that junior class over at Central couldn’t tally a Division II title but instead, went an impressive 15-0 on its way to the CCC Tournament championship and a No. 1 state ranking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this squad was ready to return four seniors to the fold in one final pursuit of a state title – the first time the CIAC allowed teams to compete over a full slate of games due to COVID.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the squad lost its third leading scorer (Sean Wininger, 8.2 points-per-game) along with talents like D’Ante Ross and Eli Rodriguez.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, entering the 2021-22 campaign, who was going to be the fifth starter of the grouping that already included studs such as Donovan Clingan, Victor Rosa, Damion Glasper, and Carson Rivoira?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central head coach Tim Barrette could have selected several promising components from the bench to fill that need.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Centers Julius Powell or Jayeson VanBeveran could have fit in well or a guard like Aaron Brown or even football stud Tre Blair would have been ready for the challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But instead, Barrette found himself with an unlikely transfer student in the form of senior Steve Alseph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Sacred Heart closing in Waterbury, Alseph made the move to Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That senior guard was a major reason why the Rams stayed in motion on the court for thirty-two minutes a game, leading to a 28-0 record and the school’s second ever championship in boys hoop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in that championship contest, pitting No. 1 Central versus No. 2 Northwest Catholic, the senior posted five points and snared nine huge rebounds as Alseph helped the Rams navigate a tough first-half of play over their 56-36 victory against the Lions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You don’t run a car without an engine,” said Barrette of Alseph. “Donovan could be the car, but Alseph is my engine. [He’s] somebody that wants the ball in the last three minutes in the state tournament. He comes off after Damion hits that 3 to end the third [period with Central up by 12] and he says ‘guys, it ain’t over. Stop smiling. We’ve got to dig in defensively.’ I can’t say enough good things about Steve Alseph.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a bulldog and an absolute worker.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Don’t be fooled by his numbers because Alseph put up Alvin Robertson (look him up on YouTube, youngsters) like totals of 6.3 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.3 steals-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He did a little of everything for Central and the results spoke for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Steve [is] probably the most underappreciated player in the area,” said Central assistant coach and stats guru Keith Lipscomb. “His defense is one of the biggest reasons we didn’t lose a game.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alseph was a bully on the boards over his final two scholastic games, snagging 19 total rebounds to help keep opponents at bay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take that, Dennis Rodman.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was his work on the offensive glass over those two final encounters that was just as impressive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alseph grabbed a total of seven offensive rebounds during Central’s showdowns against Wilton and Northwest Catholic – snaring five against the Lions alone in the championship tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You see him mix it up tonight,” said Barrette of Alseph. “That man was battling inside because Steve Alseph will win at all costs. That’s one thing I’ll say about Steve Alseph.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively this season, he drained 17 three-pointers – second on the team – and posted a season-high 13 points when Central rolled Enfield to the tune of 91 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in his only season for the Rams, the likeable Alseph made a lot of friends, and fans, along the way to a banner season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I] absolutely loved the way he played for us,” said Lipscomb of Alseph.&nbsp;</p>
