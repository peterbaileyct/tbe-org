<p>NEW BRITAIN – After a tough outing against the Plainville baseball team, it was bounce back time for the Bristol Eastern baseball program in New Britain on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers did exactly that over a whirlwind final inning of play. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored four unearned runs in the top of the seventh inning, breaking a 2-2 tie, and went on to defeat New Britain 6-2 from Beehive Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers evened their ledger to 2-2 while the Hurricanes remain winless after five tries (0-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was only a 1-1 game going into the sixth frame and after each team tallied a run, the game was again a stalemate going into the final stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the seventh, Will Estronza was on the hill for New Britain when the showdown quickly fell apart on the home squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Elliot Norris singled past shortstop with one out, stealing second, and went to third on a wild pitch – representing the go-ahead run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill walked and with men on the corners, Cole Latko's grounder was misplayed as Norris scored to make it a 3-2 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two runners in scoring position, Ryan Maglio grounded to third but New Britain failed to record an out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The throw home attempting to tag-out Churchill was off the mark as he scored the second run of the inning, making it a 4-2 contest in Eastern’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko took second on the play and with runners on second and third, Ben D'Amato was at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he made the defense pay as he bounced a single just out of the reach of the second baseman, clearing the bases, and the two RBI hit propelled Eastern to a 6-2 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Hurricanes had a response in the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern reliver Ryan Maglio got the first two outs in the final inning but New Britain quickly loaded the bases – putting the tying run at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error, a single, and a walk loaded things up but New Britain’s Joman Rodriguez grounded out to short to end the game as Eastern won for the second time this year, taking a 6-2 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato had two hits and three RBI while Norris added two singles and stole two bases as the Lancers had only five hits on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Mike Roalf pitched a stellar 5.1 innings, allowing just four hits, two runs (one earned), striking out five while walking four over his no-decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern turned two double plays to end the third and fourth frames in support of Roalf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio relieved Roalf in the sixth and wiggled out of the seventh inning jam to earn the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain took a 1-0 lead in the second as a walk to Gaby Roman, who quickly stole second base, scored on a double to center by Emani Gonzalez to give the Hurricanes an early lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern then tied the game in the fourth when Rio Fernandez doubled to left and came around on an infield error to make it a 1-1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers nabbed a 2-1 edge in the sixth as Maglio started the frame with a base-on-balls with one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez was then hit by a pitch, putting runners on first and second, and D'Amato followed with his flair to right, scoring pinch runner Kamden Laprise, as D’Amato’s two-base gem saw Eastern grab its first lead of the afternoon at 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;New Britain came right back in the bottom of the sixth to tie the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will Estronza got on via an Eastern infield error and went from first to third on a wild pick-off attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scored when Elian Collado dropped a single over third, notching the score at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio came in to relieve Roalf and pitched out of the sixth inning jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone, Maglio walked two to load the bases but struck out Emani Gonzalez to end the sixth on an eight-pitch at bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Eastern’s seventh inning heroics sealed the deal as the Lancers got back to .500 with the four-run victory against the Hurricanes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain starting pitcher Joman Rodriquez was effective, pitching the first six innings, giving up three hits and one earned run, but could not generate the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will play three games in four days as Eastern is on the road against Northwest Catholic on Friday, travels to Lewis Mills on Saturday, and takes a trip to Platt on Monday for a CCC South clash from Ceppa Field in Meriden.</p>
