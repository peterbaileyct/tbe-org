<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central football program is looking to turn things around over the month of November, starting with a huge confrontation at Wethersfield on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles have been playing well as of late and are firmly in the Class MM playoff mix.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about knocking the Eagles out of playoff contention with an upset victory by the Rams?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tre Blair and company will look to make that happen offensively and if the defense can stop Wethersfield’s impressive strike-ability, Central might be able to snare a big road victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a quick look at the game:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Central (1-6) at Wethersfield (6-1) – CCC Tier II Showdown&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>Friday,7:00 p.m. (Cottone Field at Wethersfield High School)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Central and Wethersfield were common foes in CCIL days gone by with the Eagles holding the series edge at 13-8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>The Eagles have won four straight games, scooping up a 41-7 triumph at South Windsor last Friday night while the Rams dropped a tough 34-20 decision at Middletown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Wethersfield showdown:&nbsp;</strong>Back on September 24, 2021, Central was able to topple Wethersfield, 28-18 which was the squad’s second straight victory of the campaign (the second of what would turn into a nine-game winning trek). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fast Facts: </strong>Central is a much better squad than its 1-6 ledger indicates but, because of the program’s recent success, the locals have an amazingly tough schedule and Wethersfield is another tough, top CCC program the locals must find a way to top…The Rams have lost five straight games but the Rams have a chance against the Eagles though the program is a solid outfit...Currently, Wethersfield is ranked sixth in the Class MM playoff field with Middletown and Newington remaining on their slate…The Eagles average 28.9 points-per-game while yielding 13.9 ppg defensively…Sophomore chucker Camden Righi can throw the football a bit but the program’s true strength is in its ground assault…Righi and junior Jova’n Hill are both on their way to 1,000-yard rushing totals this season and help the program average nearly 7.0 yards-per-carry. The duo is fast, proficient and will outrun the defense when sprinting to the outside…The Rams must stop that vaunted running game to keep with arm’s reach in this one…The Wethersfield program has some big boys defensively but Blair, who continues to lead the Central program in rushing and receiving yards, will present plenty of issues with his speed, agility and guile…Blair is as versatile as any player on the field and has shown a little ability in passing the football as well…While Blair can’t throw the football to himself, he’ll find targets in Aiden Lamarre, Nik Salinas, Carmelo Thompson among others…The Rams need to find ways to make stops defensively as the program has allowed 167 points over its past four games (41.8 ppg)…Last week, the Rams still had a chance to keep pace against Middletown early but simply couldn’t get a second TD early enough to keep the pressure on…But it’s a new week and against Wethersfield, Central just has to limit its miscues…If the program can stop the Eagles from making the big play, perhaps a chance for the locals to get to the pay window is in order…This thing is eventually going to turn around for the Rams and it could start against Wethersfield.  </p>
