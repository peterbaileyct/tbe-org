<p>Don’t take too many deep breaths, Bristol, cause the sky has not been looking so good. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are wildfires everywhere and now tornados have become more frequent and severe, but the staff of TBE takes no side in the climate change debate.</p>

<p>Now that the 2022-2023 scholastic sports year is over in Bristol, Mike is bored and needs activities. Please contact him if you need your lawn mowed, grocery shopping done or house painted. As for TBE, we will be on the lookout for neighborhood whiffle ball games he can cover.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">This day in history</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 8, 1949, British author&nbsp;George Orwell&nbsp;published his dystopian classic, 1984<strong><em>, </em></strong>warning against&nbsp;totalitarianism and introducing such concepts as&nbsp;“Big Brother”&nbsp;and the “Thought Police.” (No need to be concerned about that today, though.)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Answer to Monday’s trivia question</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Literally thousands of TBE readers reminded us that we did not give the answer to Monday’s trivia. Just as a reminder, here was the question -- “Who had the record for most appearances in the center square on The Hollywood Squares?”  The answer -- Paul Lynde. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s it for today, Bristol. You will never be as young as you are right now.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
