<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central volleyball program finally found a way to topple its crosstown rival Bristol Eastern this past Monday night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the decision was nearly three decades in the making.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After losing to the Lancers in 56 straight matches, the Rams flipped the script over three sets of on court warfare – leading to a 3-0 sweep and its first ‘W’ against Eastern since November 3, 1994.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game scores were 25-23, 25-20, and 25-18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels amazing,” said Central’s Sam Sklenka. “It’s like everything we’ve ever dreamed of.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once the Rams had its game-winning point tallied in the showdown played from the ‘Pepperdome’ on the campus of Bristol Central High School, it was celebration time as the fans spilled out onto the court in a massive celebration with the jubilant players.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To be honest, I thought that was one of our most complete games” of the season said Central coach Lancer Pepper. “From the defensive end to the offensive end to our serving to, honestly, a little bit of everything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central improved to 13-5 overall – winning five of its past six games – while Eastern fell to 10-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match was a back-and-forth affair from the onset despite the ultimate sweep by the Rams but every time Eastern made a late-set comeback, Central had all the answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lance said his kids haven’t played a game this well the entire year,” said Eastern coach Stefanie Reay of Central.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the three sets, nine lead changes and 17 ties highlighted a fast-paced back-and-forth showdown between the squads.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opened the first set with a 5-3 push but a 5-1 run by the Lancers – bookended by kills from Jayna Hatcher (two kills) and Lauren Bender (14 kills) – Eastern snared an 8-6 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams never allowed the deficit to reach more than three points as the home team continued to push the issue offensively.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers led 16-13 midway through the period but made it 21-18 off two Central miscues and a slick kill from Adrianna Reay (two kills) off a neat set-up by Alyssa Valentine (14 assists).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central responded as Brooke Valentino’s (19 kills, five aces) slick serving, along with big swings and kills from freshman Lily Kirk, led to six straight points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Central setter Alex Rivera (28 assists) served up a short set to Kirk for a loud jam, the Rams were sitting on set point, 24-21.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two consecutive points from the Lancers trimmed the deficit to one, nearly forcing ‘overtime’ before a bad Eastern serve landed in the net as Central picked up a 25-23 victory to open the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second set was competitive early as the squads battled to a 5-5 stalemate before Central scooped up an eventual ten-point cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Higgins, Valentino, and Kirk were solid on the service line while Valentino was tremendous up front, compiling kill after kill, and via Central’s 15-5 run – punctuated by a Maddie Lodovico ace – gave the home program a 20-10 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just when it appeared Eastern was about to fall, the Kingstreeters went on a big run of its own.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bender started spiking shots down, serves from Andrea Martir-Perez kept the Rams’ defense busy, and off a couple Central gaffes, the deficit was chopped to 20-17.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My girls didn’t give up,” said Reay. “They kept their heads up. They were working hard.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when the ensuing Bender swing saw the ball end up in the net, Pepper quickly sighed in relief as Central earned the ball back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were down two points late but Central ended the tilt in victory as an Eastern shot was stopped and when Kirk slipped in a long ace – finding an open spot near the backline of the court – the Rams were 25-20 winners, going up 2-0 in the match and on the verge of something very big.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over third set play, things remained close throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 4-4 start, Eastern went on a 4-1 burst as a swing by Gabby Caucci was not returned and she immediately dropped in an ace to give the Kingstreeters an 8-5 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when the Rams got the ball back on the service line, Kirk ended up drilling several sharp serves over the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight straight Central point's later, ended by a Kirk ace and a loud Lodovico flush, the home team was in charge at 13-8 as Eastern called timeout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got contributions across the board from everyone,” said Pepper. “That’s what you have to do in order to beat a team like Eastern.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers eventually caught its collective breath, took advantage of a couple Central mistakes, and off the power of an 8-3 jaunt – including a serve from Alyssa Valentine that could not be returned – the event was all knotted up at 16-16.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the Rams staved off all sorts of trouble over the final minutes of the match as Sam Sklenka and crew got its hands on every ball to make critical returns off plenty of hustle and guile.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The ball didn’t hit the floor and that was the biggest thing,” said Pepper. “We were persistent after every ball.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central powered through to the end, via a 9-2 burst, to seize the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivia Clingan hit an unreturnable serve, Higgins dropped in one of her own, the Lancers made some late set miscues and when Kirk deflected a shot that fell cleanly on the Eastern side of the court, the host squad nabbed a 25-16 victory in set three – earning the 3-0 sweep – as bedlam reigned in the Pepperdome. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Central didn’t let a ball hit the floor,” said Reay. “They did a fantastic job. I’ve got to give them complete credit.”</p>
