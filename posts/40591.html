<p>Among the topics for consideration at this evening's Board of Finance meeting are the approval of funds for a new Northeast Middle School and a new firehouse for Forestville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The overall $102,375,000 cost for the new school is $13,306,035 more than the original conceptual estimate of $89,068,965. The schematic design work was completed by D'Amato+Downes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Areas where the increases were largest in trade costs, which involve labor and materials for plumbing, electrical and HVAC of over $8 million and construction costs, which include building construction, labor and materials of over $10 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A resolution to add the $13,306,035 to the previously allotted $89,068,965 for the total cost for the school seeks board approval to issue bonds, notes or obligation for financing. The proposal for the Northeast Middle School to replace the current school is for a 130,000 sq. ft. building at the same location. The final decision is subject to approval by Joint Board.</p>

<p>The new firehouse for Forestville, Firehouse 3, has gone through several iterations before being considered in its current form. Originally, the city appropriated almost $7 million dollars for a 10,281 sq. ft. station with three bays that was subsequently reduced to 7,700 sq. ft. with two bays after costs increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This proposal returns the third bay for a total of 8,734 sq. ft. for a cost of $8,770,000, requiring an additional $1,720,000. The funding will come from bonding and will be added to the previously approved amount. The increase, if approved, is subject to final approval by the Joint Board.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other business, the Finance Board was apprised of the city council having approved a workers' compensation settlement with Ann Marie Barrios for $288,000, an application for $33,363.55 to the State of Connecticut Dept. of Emergency Services for the Federal Fiscal Year 2023 Emergency Management Performance Grant, that the city council approved wages increases for Bristol Parks, Recreational, Youth and Community Services' part-time and seasonal staff and that the city council approved the position of a second city engineer with opportunities for advancement to city engineer with appropriate licensing. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
