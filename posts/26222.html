<p>Philip “Phil” E. Rancourt, Jr., 51, of Bristol, passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, May 10. He was born on Nov. 30, 1971, in Stafford Springs, son of Philip E. Rancourt, Sr. and the late Sandra (Jacobsen) Rancourt.</p>

<p>Besides his father, Philip Sr., Phil is survived by his best friend and partner Barry Nolan of Bristol; their dogs Rocky and Luna Belle; his "mother-in-law" Mary Ellen Nolan of Bristol; Godchildren Abigael, Macklin, and Sean Jeffrey “SJ” Lowd of Bristol; and several nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p>

<p>Besides his mother, Phil is predeceased by his brother Richard Allen Rancourt.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Phil was a devoted employee at Legrand Wiremold in West Hartford for more than 20 years. He was a dedicated and compassionate partner, caring friend, and proud Godparent. He possessed a personality bigger than life with a contagious smile and a quick, witty sense of humor. He was a bright light in the lives of everyone he met and will certainly be missed by many. Phil enjoyed traveling, camping, or spending a night snuggling with his partner and dogs, dancing the night away at local nightclubs, and spending time with friends.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
