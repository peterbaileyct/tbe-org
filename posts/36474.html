<p>Most city employees completed the move back to the newly renovated city hall by Nov. 1, according to the schedule released from the mayor's office earlier in October. The exceptions are the office of the Registrar of Voters and the office of the Town and City Clerk, which will wait until after Tuesday's municipal election to move back.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scramble to unpack boxes and acclimate to the new environment will take some time, but for all intents and purposes, city hall is open for business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The public, over a 100 of which participated, was invited to a building dedication ceremony and open house in mid-October. City council members from this administration and the previous one which initiated the renovation, Public Works employees who were integrally involved in the renovation, members of the Public Works board, and principals in the architectural firm and construction firms that worked on the project joined members of the public, filling the new lobby and balconies of the three floors to capacity.</p>

<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano moderated the ceremony, which included speeches from the mayor, project leader for the city, principal of the architectural firm responsible for the design and principals from the construction company which completed the project. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the ceremony, two members of the family of former Mayor James P. Casey, grandson Ryan and son Dan Casey, presented the mayor with a proclamation from the city council upon the death of Mayor Casey. A long-serving mayor who died in office, Casey was instrumental in getting city hall built as part of the administrations involved with the revitalization of the city after the flood of 1955. The proclamation will be hung in the newly renovated city hall.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
