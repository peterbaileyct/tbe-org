<p>BRISTOL - You know what was of the best part of the most recent Battle for the bell from Muzzy Field on Thanksgiving was?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer some people would give was that Central was able to keep the bell and that’s certainly a legitimate response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others might comment on the beautiful weather in what turned into a sunny, 50 degree day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No snow equals no go and we were all happy about how the late morning and early afternoon went along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there wasn’t a trace of mud on Muzzy Field that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boots were not required on Turkey Day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, and this is in terms of game, there weren’t any personal fouls called that day and this was during a rivalry game when emotions always run at their highest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s an impressive feat between the programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams were tremendous on that front because it’s easy for the athletes from both sides to fall into tomfoolery mode when Central and Eastern hit the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But those guys who dressed up as zebras that day (you know, the officials) still made ridiculous calls due to some of the actions on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And two calls where flags were issued seemed absolutely mind-numbing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bristol Edition Sports Editor Jack Krampitz (or whatever he calls himself these days) can cue up a picture that was taken by Herve Letendre from the press box that day, here was puzzling call number one.</p>

<p>Look at that spectacular move by Rosa as he hurdled Eastern’s No. 11 Jeremy Kolloverja (more on him later) on his way downfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Rosa has the play up on his Twitter feed and said he “had some fun today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked like ‘The Six Million Dollar Man’ (it was a show from the 1970s on NBC. Youtube it).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that outstanding play, after Rosa leapt over Kolloverja, an official threw a flag and there was confusion on the penalty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa was called for hurdling and that’s a foul in high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, if Rosa - possibly on his way to UCONN after graduation to compete collegiately - did that for the Huskies, it’s a legal play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right around the year 2000, hurdling was made legal by the NCAA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to throw a flag for that athletic move on Thanksgiving was absolutely a bogus call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I’m not alone in my assessment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My wife - yes, I’ve dragged her into this conversation - called Rosa’s move ‘game play’ and it was an incredible moment in scholastic sports (go to Rosa’s Twitter feed from November 25 to see the actual play).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What else do you want from the kid?!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you supposed to run around Kolloverja because he’s going to tackle you if you’re running towards the Eastern standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re faulting a kid for doing something hardly anyone else can do athletically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could those officials ever do something like that at Rosa’s age?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer is probably no.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And why can’t you jump over a kid in high school?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It just seems to be a silly infraction to highlight but it wasn’t the only call that made me cringe on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Puzzling penalty number two involved a Bristol Eastern player this time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s go back to Kolloverja again who made one heck of a kickoff return early in the third period - for 33 yards - to get Eastern to about midfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The return was his career best, one of three he made that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But not so fast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, Kolloverja did not hand the ball back to the official fast enough and - you guess it - out came a flag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all my years of observing scholastic football, I’ve never seen that called after a kickoff return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Failing to hand the ball back to the official in a timely manner is a penalty but was that play by Kolloverja a ‘deliberate action by a player to delay the spotting of the ball to begin the next play?’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, it wasn’t and the employees from our local Foot Locker were at it again with their yellow hankies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a deadball penalty, for five yards, in a game that Central was in firm control of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If this was a hotly contested game and things were out of control, penalties are devices that can help sway those actions but the 2021 contest was a well-played affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two calls were simply unnecessary and while the ‘infractions’ were within the letter of the law, it doesn’t mean an official has to throw a badly timed flag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than those two calls, however, the Battle for the Bell was a well-contested game and a tremendous 38-8 victory for the Rams.</p>
