<p>Hahn has said in his promotional material that he is hoping this forum can in some way compensate for the total lack of any scheduled debates this year. The Chamber of Commerce usually hosts a debate between the candidates but will not be doing so in this election cycle.</p>

<h2>Martin's anti-abortion views are sure to be one of the issues discussed</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hahn has reminded the public on his Facebook page that Martin was the largest contributor to the organization&nbsp;Celebrate Life, which was an anti-choice organization from the 1980's with the intent of abolishing abortion in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to news reports at the time, Celebrate Life was proposing to:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Force women who had abortions to register with City Hall</li><li>Track women who had an abortion</li><li>Mandate anesthesia and burial for fetal tissue</li><li>Lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and end reproductive freedom.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hahn's press release includes that information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just this past legislative session, Public Act 22-19 was passed by the legislature. It is a first-in-the-nation law that will protect medical providers and patients seeking abortion care in Connecticut who may be traveling from other states that have outlawed abortion. Additionally, the law expands abortion access in Connecticut by expanding the type of practitioners eligible to perform certain abortion-related care.</p>

<p>Martin and Republican counterpart in House District 77 Cara Pavalock-D'amato voted no. Whit Betts (R-78) who is retiring his seat in the state house, was absent and did not vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Martin was contacted by TBE and asked to comment. He had not replied at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
