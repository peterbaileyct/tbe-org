<p>The University of Connecticut’s football program has been surpassing all expectations in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And former Bristol Central speedster Victor Rosa is a huge part of that resurgence by the Huskies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last Saturday, Rosa and company toppled the University of Massachusetts by a 27-10 final as the Huskies moved to 5-5 overall (4-1 from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium in East Hartford).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa helped the running back corps scoop up nearly 250 yards as the freshman tallied 87 yards on 17 carries – ultimately leading to two touchdowns as the program is on the verge of a bowl bid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UCONN has won four of its five last games while UMASS fell to 1-8 – losers of six straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa scored on touchdown rushes of five and 12 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his efforts against UMASS, Rosa was recognized for his outstanding play with an impressive weekly award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The running back earned the Week 10 Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll for his play against the Minutemen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two touchdowns matched a season-high for Rosa as he leads the team in TDs this year with six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa has been a stabilizing force offensively – scooping in 387 yards on 102 carries overall. Those numbers are good for an average of 3.8 yards-per-carry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, his 102 carries lead the Huskies’ program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After not seeing the ball against Utah in Connecticut’s opener, Rosa has been a fixture of the UCONN offense over the program’s ground schemes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s ramped up his level of play over his last four games, scooping up 279 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three out of those four efforts led to winning endeavors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa rushed for 89 yards on 16 carries for two touchdowns back on October 8 as UCONN hung a 33-12 loss on Florida International.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 89 yards remain his season high while busting the Panthers for a 61 yard sprint – showing the same grit, gall, and quickness that made him a staple of Bristol Central’s offense over the last few years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UCONN has two regular season games remaining on the docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut squares off against Liberty (8-1) in a huge bout this Saturday from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at 12 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rosa and the Huskies end regular season play on November 19 with a huge bout against Army on the road, also scheduled for noon, from Michie Stadium in West Point, New York.</p>

<p><strong>About the Paul Hornung Award</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Paul Hornung Award presented by Texas Roadhouse, now in its 13th season, is given annually to the most versatile player in major college football by the Louisville Sports Commission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Award pays tribute to the late football legend and Louisville native Paul Hornung.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner and his family will be honored at the annual Paul Hornung Award dinner in downtown Louisville in March, 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Louisville Sports Commission successfully launched the Paul Hornung Award in 2010 to honor its namesake and native son, and to promote outstanding performances by versatile college football players who often go unnoticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each week during the regular season, a panel of college football experts selects players for the Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll based on performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A national selection committee comprised of 17 sports journalists and former NFL stars votes for the Hornung Award finalists and the winner, with fan voting powered by Texas Roadhouse comprising the 18th vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regional accounting firm Dean Dorton independently tabulates all votes.</p>
