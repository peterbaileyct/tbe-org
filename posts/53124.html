<p>"I'm excited to share the release of the first three chapters of BRXSTOL Podcast Episode 2, 'The Mission.' In this episode, a prodigal son (Nathan Birge) returns home with the expectation of being called back into his family affairs," writes Chris O'Brien in an email about the next installment of the series.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than fulfilling these expectations, Birge must uncover who or what is behind the intrigue or accept "a fate that will soon be his own."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will be the final chapters of "The Mission," will be combined with a special event that invites BRXSTOL followers outdoors for an experience that will unlock another clue in the saga that began in November of 2023. Participants who complete the challenge will receive a personalized souvenir.</p>

<p>Full details about the special event and memento will be featured in a short video scheduled for release in early November.</p>

<p>The website for BRXSTOL, an immersive storytelling project featuring Bristol’s clockmaking history, clues to unraveling a mystery and podcasts, has been updated, according to its creator.</p>

<p>A program in May at the Bristol Public Library attracted two dozen people who have been following the saga since it began last year. The initial event kicked off just after Thanksgiving with a presentation at the Bristol Historical Society.</p>
