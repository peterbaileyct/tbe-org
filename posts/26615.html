<p>BRISTOL – After a slew of injuries, missed opportunities, and just plain old bad luck, the Bristol Central baseball team finally broke its losing streak on Monday evening, posting a 7-1 victory over crosstown rival Bristol Eastern from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams moved to 13-6 overall – breaking their six-game winless streak – while the Lancers fell to 5-13 with two games to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the second straight contest against the Kingstreeters, Central’s Nate Pirog pitched his squad to the win.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirog’s pace on the mound was tremendous, speeding the batter’s up to an uncomfortable level, as he earned another victory behind a one run, six hit, nine strikeout, three walk complete game effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nate’s been pitching great all year,” said Central coach Bunty Ray. “I mean his two losses, we didn’t give him any run support. When we went out and scored three [runs] for him today [in the first inning], I said, ‘wow, that’s something new.’ He lost [two] 2-1 games this year. [When] he gets three runs, he’s going to go out there and he’s going to smell blood in the water.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Maglio battled over his four innings of work, allowing six runs on five hits and four base-on-balls while hitting a couple batters along the way in drawing the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central attacked right off the bat in the first inning, seeing its first five batters reach safely for a quick 3-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Gratta and Anthony Santilli (two walks, single) both walked, leading to big Oscar Kuzniar cracking a double to right to clear the bases. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading 2-0, Rocco Spirito was plunked on top of the helmet by Maglio and finally, an RBI single to left from Ryan Ring (two RBI) scored Kuzniar as the Rams scooped up a 3-0 cushion just a half inning into things.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think five of those seven runs were [due to] walks or guys getting hit by a pitch,” said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet. “That’s kind of been a theme for us all year. Right when we had a couple nice innings, we hit or walked the leadoff guy.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve preached all year that walks and hit batsmen are going to come around and kill you and that’s kind of what did it today.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first, defense fueled Central in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey McMahon made a slick catch of a Gabe White line drive at second base, Spirito raced to mid-right field, diving to catch a Connor Cyr offering, and then Mike Allan made a slick grab and throw on a Ben D’Amato groundout to shortstop that sent Eastern down in order.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams left one man on in the second and after Pirog retired the first five batters he faced, Eastern’s Rio Fernandez (2-for-3) dropped a blazing single into left – later stealing second to get into scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Gratta chased down a fly ball by Isaac Roberge in centerfield to end the second stanza.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third, Central’s Aiden Lopez drew a two-out walk and moved to third base when a pickoff attempt at first saw the ball roll all the way to the fence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lopez never scored as Eastern kept it a 3-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central returned the favor to the Lancers in the bottom of the frame when Kyle Babin dropped in a base hit to left and when Pirog tried to pick him off first, an error was made off the throw, and the runner ended up third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No damage was done by the miscue and to start the fourth, Central’s Christian Stafford was hit by a pitch and moved to second on a passed ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allan then drew a walk to put men on first and second without the benefit of an out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gratta’s single to left scored Stafford and when Santilli hit an absolutely perfect slow roller between first and second, the bases were cleared again as the two RBI tally gave Central a 6-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We manufactured runs,” said Ray. “We left a lot of guys on. I wished we produced a little bit more, but beggars can’t be choosers at this point. It’s been a while since we really got going [offensively].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got one back in the bottom of the fourth, loading the bases with no one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato singled to right, Maglio walked, and Mason Harris (2-for-4) beat out an infield hit to third base – with the play at third a bit too late to get D’Amato coming in which loaded things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato eventually scored on a wild pitch to trim the deficit to 6-1 through four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern relief pitcher Jonny Montgomery did well taking over for Maglio in the fifth, going 1-2-3 to get the home team back to the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Connor Cyr earned a two-out base-on-balls in the bottom of the fifth, but Pirog was dealing – keeping the contest a five run game through five.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gratta was hit with a Montgomery pitch to start off the sixth, Kuzniar reached via error and Spirito walked to load the bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sacrifice fly to center from Ring plated Gratta, giving Central an imposing 7-1 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I went back to the old line-up,” said Ray. “Guys were doing their jobs, getting on base, producing runs. That’s a good sign for us heading into the postseason.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the bottom of the frame, Eastern went on the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio was drilled by a pitch, Harris singled and when Fernandez’s offering to third base went for an infield hit, Eastern had the bases juiced with no one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central’s defense had all the answers – highlighted by an amazing chase down of a foul ball by Ring on a Caleb Molinsky pop-up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ring hustled after the ball, making the catch as he went crashing into the backstop off a tremendous effort and Babin flew out to Lopez in left to end the sixth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All season, we left a lot of guys on base,” said Gaudet. “We had the basses loaded twice. The only run we scored was on a passed ball. Timely hitting, we didn’t have it today.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gratta was again plunked by a ball with two away in the seventh, reaching base for the fifth time in five tries, while Santilli followed up with a walk.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the two runners ended up stranded as the Kingstreeters were down to their final three outs, trailing by six.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers showed some fight late with Cyr walking and Maglio singling just past the outreached arm of Allen to put a couple men on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one out later,&nbsp;Eastern was finally retired as Central came away with a big 7-1 win to move to 13-6 overall with one game to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This was probably the most important win of the season at this point,” said Ray. “You come out 12-0 and then all of a sudden, injuries hit you every which way and you’re losing games in different ways, not necessarily playing bad, just not controlling all three [phases] like we were. One day we’d pitch, one day we’d hit, one day we’d played defense, but we never played all three together.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Against Bristol Eastern], we played all three together and that’s the type of team we are when we do all three things. We’re tough to beat.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
