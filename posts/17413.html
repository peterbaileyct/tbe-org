<p>Hey, everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s weather, 60 degrees, partly sunny and windy. Eh.</p>

<h3>Yesterday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boy, yesterday morning’s weather was depressing. Where is the Paroxetine when you need it?</p>

<h3>City Council</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of the city council, last night, the council voted for a hybrid regarding cannabis sales in Bristol. Thank God. Because if anyone is in desperate need of adult recreational cannabis, it’s this group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Easy folks, it was just a joke laying there on the floor waiting to be picked up, but in this case it’s true!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, joke. Let's take step a back, keep our hands visible, simmer down and take some Paroxetine, together if we must.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although they signaled right, they turned left. Well done. They got it right. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving on…</p>

<h3>Open Letter</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear U.S. Constitution:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are there a different set of laws within your text for the wealthy and powerful?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A. Friend</p>

<h3>Bristol trivia answer:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third chairman of the Mum Festival was James McCall Sessions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Sessions was born in 1920 in Hartford. He was a graduate of Yale University, served as a captain in World War II and was a local business man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third person to walk on the moon was Charles “Pete” Conrad. As commander of Apollo XII he said, “Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil but that's a long one for me.”</p>

<h3>The Brush Off</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That does it for this week, folks. Enjoy the Mum Festival and with a few lucky breaks, we can all meet back here Monday and compare notes.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em></p>
