<p>BRISTOL - The 2021 Bristol Central boys basketball team put together so many amazing achievements over the past 12 months or so - starting a chain of events in January that saw three different sports programs at the school excel to the highest level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all started with Rams’ outstanding 2021 pandemic induced boys hoop campaign - going 15-0 - and then in the fall, Central had two outstanding, state level contenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BCHS football squad, staring the likes of Victor Rosa and Damion Glasper, helped the team get back to the state tournament for the first time since 1987, compiling a sterling 9-2 record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across the gridiron, bulldog Carson Rivoira led the 12-win boys soccer program with 19 goals as the Rams had two tremendous programs dominating play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then that outstanding run carried over to the winter as the boys basketball team returned to the court - adding Joseph Alseph from the recently closed Sacred Heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alseph joined up with Rosa, Glasper, Rivoira, and a big 7-foot-1 center by the name of Donovan Clingan - heading for UCONN - to put the scholastic basketball landscape on fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a 4-0 start to the 2021-22 campaign by the hoops squad, the football and soccer teams, as well as the basketball squad from last year’s COVID shortened season, combined for a 40-6-2 record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s 48 games/matches/contests with just six losses to speak of and don’t forget, half of those setbacks were by a single point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a year for all three of those programs!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what’s the encore?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep your eyes on the hardwood because the way the boys basketball squad is playing, will the program <em>ever </em>lose a game this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will it take an out-of-state opponent to finally top the team?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many considered the Rams the uncrowned state champs from the previous campaign and you can go back to 2019 when Central was a top-4 team but was denied a state tournament bid due to COVID.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, what’s on tap for Connecticut’s top-ranked squad in 2022?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be an exact copy of 2021 with, perhaps, another trip to Mohegan Sun in the process?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That second trip would come in March in case you were wondering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central certainly met and exceeded several of its goals from last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our goal was to end 2021 undefeated,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “And we did that. We were 15-0 in the spring [last season] and 4-0 to start the year here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s 19-0 over the 2021 school calendar year in case your mental math isn’t so good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What more can you ask from the program at BCHS?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More winning of course and that starts on Monday with a CCC South confrontation at Plainville high school (7 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s a pretty good run,” said Central coach Tim Barrette of the 19-0 record. “But we get back to work [against Plainville]. There’re no off days here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The numbers that Central is producing offensively, along with its suffocating defense, is certainly championship worthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are averaging 69.8 points-per-game while the opposition posts only 36.3 ppg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a staggering difference in terms of point differential.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of Central’s opponents haven’t scored more than 33 points against the Rams while East Catholic - ranked No. 3 in the state - lost to the locals by 15 points in a contest that was never close once it got going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those five Central athletes previously mentioned, along with football standout Julius Powell, have been major contributors to the basketball team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is posting a team-leading 25.5 points-per-game while Glasper is second at 13.5 ppg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira, known for his defensive energy and capabilities, averages 7.5 points while the ultra-unselfish Alseph chips in 5.0 ppg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell (4.0 ppg) has been a great back-up to Clingan while Rosa (3.8 ppg) does a little of everything for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s team first, second, and third for this group of young men, understanding it’s a one-game-at-a-time method for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This group isn’t overlooking anyone on its quest to get back to Mohegan Sun Arena for a Division II title opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That all re-starts with a battle at Plainville from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium tomorrow night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We get work [Friday] and get ready for Plainville on Monday and go from there,” said Barrette. [In terms of being safe from] COVID, hopefully my guys make good decisions. We seemed to have all bought in right now and that buy-in is half the battle.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m really happy to coach this team.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>RIM DUST…</strong>After winning its opening day game against Bristol Eastern on December 16, Plainville has dropped four straight contests. Plainville lost to Bulkeley, 67-66, on December 20 and hasn’t scored more than 39 points in three games since.</p>
