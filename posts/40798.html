<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team dropped a heartbreaking 49-48 decision to Northwest Catholic on Friday night, falling to 11-4 overall in a CCC interdivisional showdown.</p>

<p>On the inbounds by Northwest, Eastern fouled Maeve Staunton seconds later as she canned the game-winning free throw.</p>

<p>While she missed the second attempt, teammate Maeve Rushin (six points), daughter of former UConn women’s basketball star Rebecca Lobo, grabbed an offensive rebound and the Lancers never got the ball back again.</p>

<p>Eastern’s Autumn Udoh netted a game-high 22 points, Savannah Drury scored 11, Amanda Noel added six while Vanessa Drury, Leah Roy and Lauren Ayotte all flipped in three points apiece.</p>

<p>“Hey, they played really well,” Eastern coach Tony Floyd of his squad. “Vanessa was hurt and I thought Savannah and Cassie and Leah did a really good job out there without her. I was very pleased about that. I thought Autumn stepped her game up and the really big thing is Noel stepped her game up and started playing the way she’s capable of playing which really helped us out a lot.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
