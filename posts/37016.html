<p>In this recent election cycle, the Democrats levied numerous charges against the Republicans, from out-and-out racism to antisemitism to the misuse of a city credit card and to standing in front of them to take bows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the votes were tabulated Tuesday night, none of it mattered. Simply put, Bristol responded with an overwhelming yawn. &nbsp;Incumbent Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano and the Republican party clobbered the Democrats in an overwhelming and message-sending victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol, once a blue, is now most certainly red. One could say it is now decidedly MAGA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this, what can only be considered a mandate, the Republicans can now put their thumbprint on downtown development and other matters of concern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the Democrats, they need not go gently into the night. They can learn a lesson from the Republicans of 2019 by regaining their footing and remaining a vocal opposition.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
