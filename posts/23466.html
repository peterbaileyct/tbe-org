<p>BRISTOL - Finally, it’s postseason time for the girls basketball squads in Connecticut and that means the program over at Bristol Central is ready for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Play commences Monday for all the squads in Class L - weather permitting - as the Rams will be in action over first round competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, ranked an amazing eighth in the fray off its 15-5 regular season finish, has the ability to stay home for a couple of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams won’t have an easy first round game as No. 24 ranked Wethersfield is a very good team from the Central Connecticut Conference despite its 8-12 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central will be playing that first round showdown from the friendly confines of the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, which is a huge advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can conquer that CCC foe, a familiar opponent looms in second round competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>North Haven, ranked ninth (15-5) and coached by former Plainville mentor Jessica Neuweller, battles No. 24 Maloney from home in first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if North Haven can knock off the Spartans, the program will have to travel back to Bristol for a rematch against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In their non-conference affair back on January 21, North Haven was an 57-30 victor over the Rams in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central learned a ton from that defeat and looks forward to a possible rematch after first round play is complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can get by the first two rounds, a showdown against top ranked Pomperaug (18-2) could be in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams enter the postseason at 16-6 overall and one more win for head coach Steve Gaudet’s crew would tie the school record for victories in a season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter how you slice the 2022-23 season for the Rams, it’s been a banner campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holy Cross (18-2) is ranked second in the bracket and - like Pomperaug - earned a bye over first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other top contenders in the Class L field includes No. 3 Edwin O. Smith (17-3 in regular season play), NVL foe Torrington (No. 4, 16-4) and CCC competitor Simsbury (No. 5, 16-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph (16-4) is rated sixth while New Milford (seventh, 15-5) is just one notch above Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, opponents of the Rams are going to have to sort out the likes of shooting stud Leilani Jackson - Central’s leading scorer at 10.0 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her slick all-around game is going to be a big problem for opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensive pest Ariana Rivera (9.5 ppg) can also finish at the hoop and the tandem of Brook Watson (9.0 ppg), and senior standout Kaley Laird will defend all the best opposing players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sixth-man Nicole Riemer (8.5 ppg) has a strong post presence and is a double-tough freshman with unlimited potential, Callie Lodovico (6.0 ppg) is a tremendous part of coach Gaudet’s rotation as is three-point shooter Molly McMahon along with Julia Pikiell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t sleep on the team from Bristol Central over postseason play as the Rams are looking for a deep run.</p>
