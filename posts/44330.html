<p><strong>Judy Murrone</strong></p>

<p>I was taken back when I saw an obituary this week for Judy (McHugh) Murrone, 70. My first thoughts went to her family, and then her 56-year friendship with Linda DiMatteo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I could write a book,” Linda told me when I telephoned her. “She was always there for me, whether personal or through the Chamber of Commerce. We traveled together (as friends). I feel blessed to have known her.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pair worked together, Linda on the Chamber side, and Judy through ESPN. Linda said that having Judy in her life only made it better, the programs and projects they worked together on, and the vacations they shared, trips which also included Mary Stinchon, one of John Leone’s sisters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She lived a full life, and that included her husband, Jim, and family. In 2011, the Bristol Boys and Girls Club presented her the prestigious “Humanitarian Award. And like Linda said, “There’s so much more!” I enjoyed volunteering and working with her, too.</p>

<p><strong>ESPN BET (ESPN 2)</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While channel surfing the other day, I came across the subject above, and on the screen was Bristol’s Adrian Wojnarowski with two ladies, one, I believe being host Chiney Ogwumike. Anyway, I found it to be somewhat of a Bristol segment. They initially talked about Bristol’s Donovan Clingan likely being a premier lotto pick in the upcoming NBA Draft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While in that conversation, the host mentioned retired teacher Gale Dickau. I missed what she said. But, “Wow!” Go Gale!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Dickau boys</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Gale Dickau, it came to mind that her husband, Jack, is one of four Dickau brothers from Forestville. There are other families with multiple male siblings, such as the Ziogas, Sassu and McCarthy clans. Back to Dickau.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ed is the oldest and is not sports-minded like his brothers. Art, who was the second oldest, was a baseball player and a prime two-handed outside basketball shooter. Next is Tom, who is more of an athletic administrator. I do remember him playing hoop at the former Forestville Boys Club, though. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack was the best of the lot when it came to basketball, playing for Bristol Eastern as a member of the class of ‘65. Each of the latter three have left his mark in sports their own way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Ward family</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, like so many I miss Art Ward. It’s amazing what he accomplished during his lifetime. He’s one of Bristol’s most notable individuals in recent decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ran into his widow, Pat, last week at the Bristol Senior Center, and we exchanged pleasantries. She’s a sweetie! Also at the center was her son-in-law Jeff Holley, who heads up the maintenance department there. I’ve known him for years, and he simply goes out of his way for people. He’s married to Kim Ward.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
