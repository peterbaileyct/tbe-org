<p>BRISTOL - Last season, at the annual Bristol Girls Middle School Cross Country championship, a future Bristol Eastern running sensation won the title at the bout from Rockwell Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chippens Hill’s Kaelyn Gonzalez established a new course record with a finish of 13:51.1 as the school came away with a huge win at the 2021 event.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, from the championship meet at the extremely hilly course at Page Park last Wednesday, it was another athlete from Chippens Hill leading the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mia Stopkoski ended winning the championship behind an outstanding time of 14:59.3 to seize the individual title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That finish established a new middle school course record at Page Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chippens had a great afternoon of competition as three of the top six finishers - and six of the first 13 harriers - were from that same school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hills won the title with a score of thirty points - finishing well ahead of Northeast Middle School who tallied 56 for second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Bristol (61 points) came in third place while St. Joseph (79) seized fourth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top five times of each runner from every school made up the final score as Chippens had its top five athletes cross the finish line with times under 17:50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stopkoski is a speedy seventh grader while teammate Olivia Stafford, also in seventh grade, did well seizing third place in 15:47.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sixth grader Quinn Floyd placed fifth for Chippens in 16:18.1 and to round out their top five, seventh graders River Fellows (10th place, 17:46.2) and Mia Carenzo (11th, 17:49.2) helped the program seize the championship.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Bristol eighth grader Emersyn Mazzei (15:30.8) was the runner up of the event while Northeast seventh grader Klaudia Twardy (15:58.8) earned fourth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, for the program from West Bristol, seventh grader Isla Thibodeau placed sixth in 16:38.1 while Northeast’s duo of seventh grader Mary Primus (7th, 16:44.6) and sixth grader Arianna Lestorti (8th, 16:51) also performed well over a tough course.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding out the top-10 was sixth grader Marissa Moreau from St. Joseph with a ninth-place finish of 17:38.</p>
