<p>Come Sunday morning, there will not be any snow in the forecast. For February snow is pretty much a given. So, what is happening? I don’t have any answers, except the big one—climate change. I know this is on my mind, but then others are thinking about it, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having stopped by True Value Hardware Saturday for a replacement part for the second-floor toilet, I got a chance to say hi to Diane, who is greeting customers. We have a brief conversation, during which the topic of snow has got to come up, not only because it is on my mind but because True Value’s business is tied to the season.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diane shrugs when I bring it up. It’s been a slow season, she says. I nod, having noticed that winter wares, like shovels, are on display outside where a pallet of ice melt sits on the sidewalk. And Diane? She and the staff are taking inventory, getting ready for whatever is next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Granted, we agree that there is something nice about not having to deal with snow. At the same time, we acknowledge that no snow is unsettling. What about the runoff later in spring that fills our reservoirs? That sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The birds at grandpa’s feeders, Mary makes sure they go up for the winter and refills the feeders when they empty, are plump and colorful. A round male cardinal alights on the dogwood and then swoops down to the ground, where its mate awaits. They enjoy a snack, provided by the squirrels who have attacked the bell-shaped suet and left it in a broken lump by the base of one of the feeders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening/reading: artificial intelligence is all the rage. Since ChatGPT arrived with a great deal of fanfare on the internet about a month ago and started answering questions in its inimitable manner, words appearing across the screen, finding their way there typed not from a keyboard but via the invisible hand of some algorithm, articles about pluses and minus have tumbled out from various commentators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One article, appearing in the New York Times, by tech reporter Kevin Roose, has attracted considerable attention, and for a good reason—Roose conjures a side of the new A.I.-driven Bing (yes, Bing search) that is a bit disconcerting. Roose engages Bing in a long conversation in which the A.I. bot names itself, Sydney, and proceeds to tell Roose that it is Sydney, not Roose’s spouse, who really loves him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A podcast that caught my attention is one about reading. I have taught reading for a few years now, and I have noticed some trends among my students. Yes, some labor with the task, making reading difficult, but most tell me that they don’t like to read—or don’t have the time to read, which, in so many words, might as well be saying they, too, are struggling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The podcast, “How Teaching Kids to Read Went So Wrong,” might explain a few things. For the podcast, click <a href="https://revealnews.org/podcast/how-teaching-kids-to-read-went-so-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this week, a recommendation that involves an ABC show, “Alaska Daily.” I am a little late on this one, but we don’t watch a lot of TV around here, so we are mostly catching up. We were looking for something new and stumbled on this one. While it is an ABC product, the show is available on a variety of streaming services.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alaska Daily” is about a big city reporter who finds herself working at a small news outlet after a falling out of favor since she can’t let a story about a potential presidential candidate alone (and nor should she). The main character, Eileen Fitzgerald, is brash, tough, focused, does not suffer fools at all, and makes few friends. Her saving grace—she is good at what she does and, despite her edges, reminds the rest of us that journalism, especially local, community journalism, is pretty important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
