<p>BRISTOL – The scholastic city series baseball showdown is upon us as Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern lock horns for the first time this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 7 p.m. from Muzzy Field in what should be an entertaining bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what should we expect from the Kingstreeters on Friday, looking to spin a 3-7 record over its first 10 games?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick overview of Eastern’s the season to date:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern is looking for a midseason splash&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have struggled a bit to get to the halfway mark of the year but over the last couple games, the pitching and defense has not committed an error in the field over that stretch and are looking for a big upset over the undefeated Rams (11-0).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who is going to get the call to take the mound for Eastern against its crosstown rival?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is it Mike Roalf’s turn for his biggest start of the season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was excellent against Northwest Catholic on April 28 as the Lancers pulled out a stellar 2-1 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He gave up just four hits and fanned five against the Lions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf can and will throw strikes but the key is to keep a very aggressive array of Central base runners limited in terms of advancement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has walked a ton of batters this season but Roalf, who allowed five free passes against NWC, did not allow any of those players to tag the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio allowed just two hits and yielded 12 strikeouts over a tough 2-1 loss to New Britain this past Wednesday afternoon and probably won’t be taking the mound on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Declan Schenck, Owen Myers, Noah Gatti, Jonny Montgomery and Caleb Molinsky could see time on the hill while Rio Fernandez will be behind the plate, catching all the action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have a couple sticks in the line-up with the likes of Fernandez, Jose Feliciano and Ben D’Amato to provide some extra base hitting punch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White sets the table at the top of the Eastern batting order along with Connor Cyr, D’Amato and Maglio at cleanup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isaac Roberge, Molinsky and Kyle Babin, who is on excellent hand in the outfield, is solid defensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Eastern squad can hit the ball when in the groove but what will Central allow in terms of offense?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Don’t underestimate Eastern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, you see the 3-7 ledger and probably think this is going to be a walkover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throw that thought out the window as both programs are very familiar with the confines of Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, Central is the team to beat but Eastern has been building some good momentum over the last 10 days or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect some big things on Friday evening from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
