<p>The final rays of summer sun are illuminating early pops of autumn foliage in Bristol. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some red maples in higher elevations have started to turn lovely shades of autumn burgundy, and more sugar maples are showing orange hues around their crowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There hasn’t been a huge change in Bristol fall foliage over the past week due to warm daytime temperatures and an abundance of sunlight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forecast for the upcoming week shows the classic early fall temperature dip. Daytime highs are predicted to reach the low 70s, while overnight lows will drop into the low 40s. We’ll see how next week’s weather impacts Bristol’s color palette.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recommended Walk for Leaf Peeping: Queen Street to High Street</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This walk is exactly one mile up and down several hills. The neighborhood’s high elevation provides a great view of Memorial Park Boulevard and the changing foliage in the distance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> for instructions.
