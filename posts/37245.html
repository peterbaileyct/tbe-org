<p>EAST LYME – When Bristol Central volleyball coach Lancer Pepper had an engagement to attend this past Saturday, it meant that his squad’s Class L quarterfinal showdown against top ranked East Lyme had to play a day earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it didn’t even matter as the Rams were rolling when the squads commenced on court battle from East Lyme High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 9 Bristol Central ended up winning its first and second sets - dropping the third to the Vikings in overtime - before wrapping up the match in the fourth and final period, scooping up a 3-1 victory to advance to semifinal play for the second straight season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (19-8) will be gunning for its 20th victory on Wednesday night when the program squares off against No. 12 St. Joseph (13-6 regular season) with a trip to the finals hanging in the balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores against No. 1 East Lyme were 25-22, 29-27, 30-32 and 25-23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vikings were nearly swept that evening but managed to hang on to force a fourth set but needed to score 32 points in the third period to survive and advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In scholastic volleyball, the victor must win each set by two points once the score reaches 25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant the Vikings simply couldn’t shake the Rams until very late in the set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Lyme ended its season at 21-3 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over four sets of play, Central won by no more than three points, which is extremely close but the locals showed poise on the road to eke out a huge victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stars were out everywhere on the court for the Rams and the match was a career outing for Central junior Grace Higgins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She blasted East Lyme for 27 kills, dropping down the hammer several times against a quality front three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lily Kirk wasn’t your average second fiddle either on Friday as she swung down 16 kills to help lead the Rams’ attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Support came from multiple positions on the front line as Isabella Alves (six kills) and Emily Fontaine (five kills) tallied 11 total kills over another tremendous showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even Alex Rivera added a kill as her timely play always seems to net Central a point or two every match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Higgins flipped in four aces while Alves notched three and Fontaine played her usual brand of defense - rejecting three shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella Pratt and Alves blocked two shots apiece while libero Daigelis Figueroa was simply sensational over a 38-dig performance as defense ruled the day for the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kirk bumped up 24 digs, Higgins and Rivera tallied 15 apiece, Alves shipped out 11 while Pratt and Fontaine each posted a couple to keep the Vikings in check.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Central zipped up 107 digs, an impressive amount no matter what the final score ended up being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on the assist front, the Rams dished out 48 – all belonging to Rivera – as the All-State caliber setter truly took command of the match when the sets were hanging in the balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a tremendous effort by the entire team from Central as the program is once again on the cusp of something very big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Class L bracket has been blown apart by the likes of Central, No. 10 Bristol Eastern and No. 12 St. Joseph - along with third ranked Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, the schedule is set for Wednesday night in what has turned into a double main event - headlined by programs from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck High School will be the venue for the Class L semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 4:30 p.m., Eastern battles against Farmington in the first bout of the doubleheader and then in the nightcap, it’s Central/St. Joseph in another no-miss event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are going to be epic challenges for the programs from Bristol but wins by one<em>&nbsp;or both&nbsp;</em>local teams leads to the finals on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A trip to Naugatuck would be worth it as scholastic volleyball is certainly fun to watch in person and is a fast-paced, high action sport with plenty of drama and suspense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The road to the finals is in sight and Central would like to make a return appearance to East Haven High School on Saturday with a victory over St. Joseph Wednesday night.</p>
