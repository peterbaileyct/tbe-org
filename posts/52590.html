<p>Today I walked through the oppressive concrete jungle of Salt Lake City to find a community cafe and book shop. I take escalators up &amp; down for unknown reasons. I become lost in labyrinths of half-empty commercial spaces. I just want to go straight, but I am awkwardly funneled down a path created by a sadistic commercial developer. Yes, this is par for the course in the city by the Great Salt Lake. You can feel a well-intentioned urban planning only creating more bars to more cages that people cannot escape. I'm happy to be in this cafe. I'm surrounded by art that aligns with my experience on this planet. My politics, my preferences. I'm sure some Bristol family would say this is too much. Too loud. Obnoxious even.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would say it's the only way to be heard when you're penned into a corner your whole life. It's a single flare into the sky after a lifetime of asking to be unseen. It's the only way to get your point across after years of being talked over at the holiday dinner table. When you are 14 and your thoughts are forming and they are in their fifties and they've seen it all and they know it all but they've barely left the state.</p>

<p>This is what set me on my path to see what is out there. I felt like I was getting bad information. After 15 years of small talk in small towns and big cities across several continents - after seeing the many different ways you can construct a public space, how you can change it overtime, how you can continue to enact laws to provide the best possible outcomes for your citizens - I was definitely fed some bad information. Every time I step foot into a cafe like this I am surrounded by the echos of all my human kin that have had questions about the dominant culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope there is still a cafe/bookshop like this in Bristol. It has been too long since I've explored. We once had John Bale Book Co. in Waterbury, but I'm not sure where this space exists now. Some of it has gone into game shops with game nights where people can commune around a common goal, but my preference is books and beverages, and I love finding these outposts that can write new stories.</p>
