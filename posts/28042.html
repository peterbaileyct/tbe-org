<p>BRISTOL – When the Bristol American Legion baseball team has needed a clutch pitching performance this season, Post 2 has all the faith in the world in Caleb Molinsky.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Friday night against East Hartford/Manchester, Molinsky threw an absolute gem – leading to a 2-1 victory in a Zone 3 tilt from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky (2-1 overall) was sensational over his six innings of work, allowing only one hit and striking out six while Ryan Maglio earned the squad’s first save of the campaign in the seventh.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There wasn’t any margin of error for Bristol as Post 2 scored its two runs over first inning play and held on for dear life until the final out was recorded.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He battled,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Molinsky. “The disappointing thing was we had the bases loaded there in the sixth and if we get a couple runs, I’d just let Caleb finish the game. I think he had ten pitches left but I don’t like having guys come in in the middle of an inning. I’d much rather have Maglio start the inning.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Because it’s going to get tight. It was a 2-1 game. It’s not going to be a 1-2-3 [inning].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Losing pitcher Austin Watkins gave Bristol just four hits to work with and kept the Bristol offense at bay for most of the evening outside of the first frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EHM’s Xavi Quiles (2-for-3) dropped in a two-out single for EHM in the top of the first but even after stealing second and going to third on a wild pitch, the runner never made it home.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the bottom of the tilt, Post 2 attacked for a couple runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nick Sconziano walked to lead off and Elliot Norris followed up with a sacrifice bunt to put the lead runner in scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sconziano eventually stole third and scored on Jayden Churchill’s groundout to shortstop with the throw home not able to get the runner in time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a 1-0 lead in hand and Churchill at first base, Cole Caccamo absolutely crushed a ball to the gap in right, good for a double.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speedy Churchill scored on the play while Caccamo was gunned out at third base, but Bristol was ahead 2-0 through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second, Molinsky fanned two while Maglio made a slick throw from third base to cut down Joe Commisso heading for first base as Post 2 kept its 2-0 edge intact.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Jed Sutula earning a two-out walk was the only damage the home team could cobble together in the bottom of the second as EMH was still down by two through two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EMH got run back in the top of the third, all without the benefit of a hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carlos Torres led off with a base-on-balls and when Matt Currey bunted, the sacrifice saw the lead runner blow by second base and easily made it to third as no one covered the bag.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Torres scored on a sac fly to center, trimming the deficit to 2-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sconziano reached second base via a dropped ball in right, advanced to third on a groundout by Churchill but never came home as EHM was hanging around after three completed frames.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s defense came to the forefront in the top of the fourth after JD Navarrio walked and then stole second with two away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was masterfully picked off by Molinsky and the chase was on between Navarrio and Norris.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the speedster from Bristol won the race as Bristol maintained its slim 2-1 push with Molinsky in the midst of a one-hitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Bristol chucker went for strikeouts five and six in the top of the fifth, completely shutting down the EHM offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the bottom of the fifth, Gabe White collected Bristol’s second hit, Sconziano followed with an infield bunt and Norris slipped a single into left as the bases were juiced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Churchill bounced into a 4-3 double play as the score remained 2-1 after five.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky finished the top of the sixth with a Joey Larson grounder that bounced off the Bristol pitcher’s foot, popped right up to Norris at shortstop and the throw to first base got the runner in time as EHM still had just one hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo led off the bottom of the frame with a gapper to left and after stomping on first base, he charged to second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He beat the throw on the slide as his second double put Post 2 back in the driver’s seat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EJ Sanchez’s fielder’s choice saw Caccamo reach third base with one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Caccamo was caught off third base and tagged out as the inning ended without the benefit of a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, EHM was down to its final three outs with Maglio taking over for Molinsky on the mound in a save situation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quiles earned his second hit with another single, went to second base on a passed ball and made it to third via a wild pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, there was a man on third base without the benefit of an out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There was going to be pressure, but Mags showed me what he’s got,” said LaPenta of Maglio. “That’s a tough spot. But he battled through, and Jed did a really good job [at catcher]. He was having a really hard time seeing the guy at third base with no outs.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not to give up the tying run was huge and to also keep Mags under thirty [pitches] so he can start in the suspended game on Sunday.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Navarrio and Cody Segarra both struck out as EHM was down to its final at-bats.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Max Benelis, on a full count, walked to put men on the corners.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the encounter, EHM pinch hitter Christian Lawrence popped out to White at third base to end the game as Bristol nabbed a huge 2-1 win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you play this team here, you’ve got to get this win,” said LaPenta. “There’s just no way around it. They’re 2-10 and to get the win and not have our best pitcher start the game is huge.”&nbsp;</p>
