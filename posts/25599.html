<p>During Sunday's rain, Lt. Gworski of the PHP IDâ€™d this series of potholes across from Dunkin Donuts on Mix Street. In his report, Gworski called it a "heap of a mess." </p>

<p>It was announced that the fundraiser for Bristol Hospital, which had closed the previous day, had raised $466,622. The goal was to collect $400,000 for the hospital and $50,000 for a nurse's home. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1973 NLCS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday night at the TBE headquarters, for some unknown reason, the GMB staff found itself discussing the 1973 NLCS between the Cincinatti Reds and New York Mets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going into the playoff series, the Reds complied a regular season record of 99-63 with a winning percentage of .633. Meanwhile, the Mets were 82-79 with a winning percentage of .509.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Reds and Mets squared off 12 times during the regular season with the Reds winning eight of the games. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of that mattered come October. The Mets won the series 3 games to 2 and outscored the Reds 23-8.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Our apologies </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apologies to Bristol entrepreneur Vern Needler. TBE editor Jack Krampitz has the GMB staff on a strict word count, so we cannot mention your upcoming project. No doubt it will be a hoot. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See ya Thursday (maybe), Bristol! </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
