<p><strong>I am directing flags in Connecticut lowered to half-staff effective immediately in honor of two officers from the Bristol Connecticut Police Department who were killed in the line of duty late last night while responding to an emergency call of domestic violence at a private residence in the town. This is a senseless tragedy, and my prayers are with their families, loved ones, and fellow officers.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I also ask the residents of Connecticut to keep in their prayers a third officer who was shot and is currently in the hospital with serious injuries.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This is a devastating reminder of the dangers that police officers face every day to protect our families and neighbors from all kinds of situations. These officers are heroes and will always be remembered for the honorable service they provided to their town and state.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This continues to be an active situation, and Iâ€™ve directed DESPP Commissioner James Rovella and the Connecticut State Police to support the Bristol Police Department and the greater community in every way they can.</strong></p>

<p>The state police will be holding a press conference at approximately 8:30 a.m.</p>
