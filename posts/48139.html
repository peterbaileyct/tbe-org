<p>The soulful sounds of blues and rock are set to reverberate through Bleachers Bar once again as Brian’s Angels prepares to host its annual summer benefit concert, Angelfest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now in its fifth consecutive year, Angelfest promises an evening of performances by acclaimed blues rock musicians. Headlining the event are the Righteous Continental alongside special guests, the Vices and the Dave Fields Band featuring Liviu Pop. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greg Ray Dunnett, organizer of Angelfest, hailed the lineup as a true blues experience in support of a vital cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have great world-class blues bands showing up to play to entertain for this huge cause,” Dunnett said. “There are so many issues today combined that are making the struggle more challenging just being housed and fed and properly cared for, it’s become a full-blown crisis in many cities in the US and worldwide.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Established in 2015 by Pat Stebbins in memory of her son Brian Pinz, Brian’s Angels is dedicated to aiding individuals experiencing homelessness and food insecurity through provisions of essential resources including food, clothing, and shelter opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Event planner Mike Cansdale of Big Mac Productions emphasized the significance of community support for Brian’s Angels and Angelfest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People who attend will enjoy the music and the people who are so giving of their time to help those in need,” Cansdale said, “and this event supports local people in our own city. Supporting Brian’s Angels is important because they are helping people in our community every day. They don’t judge anyone, just support them in their time of need. We need more people like Pat Stebbins and crew.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proceeds from Angelfest will be put towards funding the critical services provided by Brian’s Angel’s amid a growing demand. Since 2020, the organization has seen a significant rise in the number of individuals seeking their assistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many middle-class and blue color types need to work two or three jobs to make ends meet,” Dunnett said. “There is a rising population in America falling through the cracks that fail to succeed in affordable housing and basic needs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As a result, there are people like Pat Stebbins at Brian’s Angels Homeless Outreach who try and fill the void to help feed and clothe these less fortunate and struggling Americans. We’ve partnered to help Pat Stebbins these five years because she needs sponsors to support her beautiful work and outreach.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angelfest is scheduled to take place at Bleachers Bar in Bristol on Sunday, Aug. 18, from 3 to 9 p.m. Tickets are priced at $20, and all attendees must be 21 years of age or older.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
