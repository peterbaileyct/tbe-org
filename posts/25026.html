<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Coop Lacrosse team has absolutely been on fire to open the 2023 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after spinning Tolland by a 7-6 final back on April 5, the Bristol contingent was back in action on Wednesday - squaring off against Newington in a CCC South affair from Alumni Field on the campus BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the boys rolled out another winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one needed a little overtime as the locals came away with a thrilling 9-8 triumph in overtime with just over a minute to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is now 4-0 on the season while Newington is still looking for its first victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a tight, back and forth game for four quarters with no team leading by more than two goals at any time,” said Bristol assistant coach Eric Bell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Bristol coop had more than a couple of standouts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Max Stavens was clutch in the net, stopping nearly two dozen shots (23 saves) for another win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he wasn’t alone over that stellar effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Dylan Brown (one goal), Jake Warszawik and Jack Hartley led the way on defense, holding a strong Newington team in check all day long,” said Bell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on the flip side, Braydon Dwyer had some clutch moments during fourth period play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During face-offs, Dwyer won 12-of-19 balls and that offense kept Newington at bay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this event needed a little extra time added to the scoreboard before Bristol was able to seize the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase Dauphinee (three goals) scored his final goal on a feed by Aidan Collins (two assists) with 1:08 left showing on the clock, jamming the ball in for the game-winner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper also added three goals while dishing off an assist, Brady Bell zipped up a goal and two assists while Ian Reardon nabbed one goal and one assist to complete a busy offensive afternoon for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s 4-0 ledger isn’t just tremendous but it’s the best start in Central/Eastern program history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, the Bristol coop has two exciting CCC South bouts, attempting to keep its undefeated ledger on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday evening, Bristol battles against Lewis Mills (6 p.m.) from Alumni Field while traveling to Enfield on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time in Enfield begins at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
