<p>She was an avid Red Sox fan and loved watching the UConn Huskies basketball teams, especially the girls. She never said no to a trip to the casino or a big mug of chocolate ice cream. She enjoyed Saturday breakfast and dinner with friends. Virginia’s greatest joy was the arrival of a grandchild or a great grandchild.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
