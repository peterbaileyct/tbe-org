<p>Before Brian’s Angels opened their doors on Wednesday afternoon, dozens of people experiencing food insecurity and homelessness were lining up to receive the comfort, food and temporary shelter provided by the Bristol nonprofit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“New faces are coming in every day,” said Pat Stebbins. “I see some of my regulars here today, but a lot of these are new clients. People need help; they can’t always make it on their own. The numbers are growing; we’re feeding 50 to 60 people a day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stebbins, who founded Brian’s Angels in memory of her son Brian Pinz, feels that the recent uptick in clients has been partially due to the recent ending of fare-free public transit buses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut Department of Transportation suspended fares on all public transit buses on April 1, 2022, to expedite boarding during the COVID pandemic and help residents financially during tough economic times. The CTtransit system resumed fare collection across Connecticut on April 1, costing riders up to $1.75 per ride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Losing free bus fare has affected a lot of people,” said Stebbins. “I think that’s part of the reason we’re seeing so many new faces. We’ve been providing people with bus passes since they started charging again.”         </p>

<p>Among the many services that Brian’s Angels provides their clients are hot meals, clothing, temporary shelter, warming/cooling center and a place to shower. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stebbins said she is grateful for the shared space the nonprofit currently occupies, in the lower level of Prospect United Methodist Church, located at 99 Summer St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, she said that she is concerned that the surge in the number of clients has created the need for a larger space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We can fit about 20 people at the tables if they’re elbow to elbow and we’re feeding more than twice that,” Stebbins said.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
