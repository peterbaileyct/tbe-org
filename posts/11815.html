<p>BRISTOL - Is there any end in sight in terms of the scoring exploits from Bristol Central boys basketball All-Stater Donovan Clingan?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing that’s going to stop the 7-foot-2 center from getting even more points is the CIAC Division II title showdown which <em>should</em> end up being his final scholastic game ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And how many points has he scored this year? How about for his career?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The numbers are simply staggering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan has knocked in 792 total points over 26 games this season which is good for an average of 30.5 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s truly an amazing tally for anyone playing on the scholastic level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan entered the game against Waterford last Friday with 747 points (Donovan is as big, or bigger, than a Boeing 747) and dropped in 29 first-half points, adding another 16 over the third and fourth periods, as he scored 45 points in the 70-48 victory – moving to 2,213 career points overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that fantastic effort, Clingan is now tenth all-time in total points in the state of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Central head coach Tim Barrette found about Clingan’s move into the top 10 of all-time scoring in the state, the longtime mentor pumped his fist and was the happiest guy in the room.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm proud of Donovan," said Barrette. "He didn't play too great [against Amistad on Thursday] to be honest. But I'm going to tell you something about Donovan. He texted me at 11 p.m. [on Thursday] and said 'coach, I'll ball out tomorrow [against Waterford].’ I can tell you this, he balled out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And along the way up the Connecticut scoring list, Clingan passed some very familiar names.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norwalk’s Calvin Murphy (13<sup>th</sup> place with 2,192 points) was a pretty good baton twirler in his day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh yes, he was also drafted by the San Diego/Houston Rockets in the NBA after a standout career at Niagara and was eventually inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern was familiar with New London’s Kris Dunn (12th, 2,201 points) in terms of Class L state tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On March 16, 2010, Dunn – then a sophomore – scored a team-high 17 points as No. 2 New London defeated No. 3 Bristol Eastern, 66-46, from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dunn was traded to the Boston Celtics during the offseason this year but was quickly shipped off to the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Phil Lott (11th, 2,212) played at Wilby in Waterbury and then collegiately at Hawaii, scoring over 1,200 points for the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the grand scheme of things, what does Clingan’s scoring exploits mean to Barrette?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"What it says to me is [Donovan] is one of the best ever to play this game coming out of this state," said Barrette. "What it means to [my players] is they don't know who [Murphy] is. They don't know who Kris Dunn is.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the pandemic never took hold of our world, Clingan would have been a top-3 scorer, rebounder, and shot blocker in the state – hands down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, maybe all those totals would have been much higher knowing the abilities of that outstanding 7-foot-2 warrior over at Bristol Central due to all those cancelled games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He would have shattered every record in this state without COVID," said Barrette. "So, the best we can do is win every game on his way out to get him a state title because no kid who chose to stay in public school deserves it more than him.”</p>
