<p>Revisions of the proposed Page Park renovation plan, additions and changes to the code or ordinances and the approval of a citywide program that allows citizens to send video to the police department are among the items to be considered at this week's city council meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Page Park renovation plan was amended to drop a synthetic turf softball field and to add item such as a slashpad, play areas and pond dredging. Costs for the project increased by just under $1 million. The changes may extend the project by just under a year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other contract amendments include work on the new parking garage behind City Hall and renovations to City Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Prepared Live," a platform that would in tandem with the one being used in the Police Department's dispatch center, allows access to caller's phones and cameras for the dispatcher to view live. The Police Board, which has approved the platform, is seeking approval from the city council to sign a contract.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the amendments and additions to the code of ordinances, the first sets a hearing for citizens to review the protocols for a new Fair Rent Commission. A second would establish a child safety zone that would, among other things, restrict sex offenders from these zones. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two others would exempt veterans from certain taxes as vendors at this year's Bristol Farmers Market and put in place penalties for removing shopping carts from the premises where they are being used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The consent calendar items, which typically relate to contract revisions and funding items that the Board of Finance has approved, include setting aside 32.5 acres off Hart Street for open space, funding for architectural/engineering services for the construction of a new firehouse in Forestville as well as sidewalk repair, roadway reconstruction and drainage work.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
