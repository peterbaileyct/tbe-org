<p>BRISTOL – The Lewis Mills baseball squad is a talented bunch that started off the 2023 campaign with two tough losses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in a showdown against&nbsp;Bristol Eastern on Monday afternoon, the Spartans exploded against the Lancers over a 9-3 victory from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first win of the campaign for Mills (1-2) while the Kingstreeters evened their ledger to 1-1 (0-1 in CCC South play).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern tallied just four hits in the game, led by blazing doubles from Ben D’Amato and Rio Fernandez.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans jumped out to a 9-0 edge after three-and-a-half innings and never looked back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills sophomore Matt Chirumbolo threw extremely well on the mound, leading to the program’s first victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right-handed ace (five Ks, only one walk) faced the minimum batters over the first four innings and pitched shutout ball in his first five frames.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the youngster allowed three hits and three runs in the sixth tilt before being relieved by Evan Dougherty.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither team netted a run over first inning play but in the second stanza, Mills attacked&nbsp;Eastern starter Ryan Maglio for four runs.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single by Lilly Martineau, followed by an RBI double from Ben Rewenko&nbsp;(3-for-3, double) made it a 1-0 contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error and a walk loaded the bases for the visiting aggression and then Tom O'Connell drilled a two-run single for a 3-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the final run came home via wild pitch, the Spartans were in front 4-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills added four more runs in the third to space out the Eastern deficit to 8-0. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans’ Cam Fisher opened the inning with a double and scored off two wild pitches to make it a 5-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rewenko then singled, swiped second and headed to third on a bunt single by Noah Moriarty.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lead runner scored on a fielder's choice, making it 6-0, before Eastern’s Declan Schenck replaced Maglio on the hill.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moriarty scored on Brett Harding's sacrifice fly and Jayden Longdin singled in Chirumbolo as the Spartans were up big, 8-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even as&nbsp;Mills added an unearned run in the fourth to snare a 9-0 cushion,&nbsp;Schenck pitched well in relief for the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw 3.2 innings of three hit ball, allowing just one unearned run, striking out three and walking just one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally in the sixth inning, Eastern generated some offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jed Sutula nabbed a base hit to open the frame and&nbsp;Maglio walked to put two runners on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato's double to right center scored Sutula and Maglio, trimming the deficit to 9-2.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez&nbsp;followed up with his two-base hit to right center, scoring D'Amato, to trim the deficit to 9-3. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dougherty eventually relieved Chirumbolo, throwing the final 1.2 innings for the Spartans.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He did not yield a hit, fanned three, walked two and helped generate a 1-6-3 double play to end the game as Mills grabbed a 9-0 decision in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back in action on Wednesday, battling Berlin on the road from Sage Park. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The Lancers play three of their next four games on the road which includes a stop at home next Wednesday (April 19) against CCC interdivisional foe Conard…Eastern is now 4-3 all-time against Lewis Mills…The contest against Berlin will mark Eastern’s 1240<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;game in program history.&nbsp;</p>
