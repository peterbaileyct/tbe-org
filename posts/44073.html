<p>Logan Rembish and Dom Napoletano tossed a combined no hitter and led St. Paul to an 8-0 win over Watertown Monday afternoon. The pair struck out 13 and allowed only two batters to reach base safely (one by walk and one by error). Starter Alex Cronk took the loss for Watertown.</p>

<p>In the top of the fourth with two outs, Coby Dagata singled. Seth Meuer's ground ball should have ended the inning, but it was bobbled, and the error extended the inning for St. Paul. </p>

<p>Keaton Kroll walked to load the bases, and Mike DeRosa singled to drive in the first run of the game. Brian Anderson followed with a two RBI single, and St. Paul led 3-0. Then Jay DeRosa struck out on a pitch in the dirt and beat the catcher's throw to first base. On the play his brother Mike scored from third with the fourth unearned run of the inning.</p>

<p>St. Paul added one on a sacrifice fly by Dagata in the fifth. In the sixth, consecutive hits by Jay DeRosa (single), Rembish (RBI double), and Cal Chance (RBI single) made it 7-0. The final run came in the top of the seventh when Kroll led off with a double, advanced to third on a wild pitch, and scored on pinch hitter Isaac Leon's SAC fly to center. The final was 8-0.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
