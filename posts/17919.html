<p>The American Clock &amp; Watch Museum announced in a press release that it will be hosting a Family Time Capsule Program at the museum on Friday, Oct. 21 at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families will be able to build their own time capsules while learning how the Museum’s founder, Edward Ingraham, preserved the history and heritage of the clock and watch industries by packing special time capsules. Over the years, the boxes have been opened at special events at the museum to reveal what was happening at the time they were packed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now Bristol families can do the same thing, as they will have the opportunity to create their own family time capsule! What items will be included in your time capsule? When you open it in 5-10 years, what memories will you find? What will your capsule say about the times you live in?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cost of the program is $10 per family. Time capsule box and decorative materials will be provided. You can bring small items and photos to put into the box or pack it when you get home. </p>

<p>You must register for the program by Monday, Oct. 17. Register by phone—860-583-6070-- or on our website—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://clockmuseum.org/" target="_blank">clockmuseum.org</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
