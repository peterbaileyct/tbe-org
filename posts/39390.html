<p>Raised in Montpelier, she was a hearty Vermont girl with an adventurous spirit. Therese loved school, family time with her siblings, and winter sports, especially ice skating, which she later passed on to her children. She came to Connecticut in her teens, where she graduated high school in Bristol.</p>

<p>She worked at Sessions Clock Company to help support her siblings. After her marriage to Roger and starting her family, Therese worked for the former Bristol Visiting Nurse Association and Allstate Insurance prior to her retirement. After retirement, she worked as secretary to her son Mark with his new auto recycling business.</p>

<p>Therese was a loving, dedicated wife and mother of seven children. She was a skilled, insightful problem solver, the “go-to” person, always ready when needed by family or friend. She had a knack for fixing things of a mechanical nature and was always ready to roll up her sleeves to tackle a challenge.</p>

<p>When she had a free moment, she could be found gardening, sewing, or reading on her favorite subject, history. Therese loved to travel, her favorites including a cross-country road trip, exploring the east coast, an Alaskan adventure, and visits to Canada and Europe. She was a longtime faithful parishioner of St. Matthew Church, Forestville where she was a member of the Guild of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
