<p>Yellow emergency tape and orange cones, each at opposite sides of an enormous tree branch that fell across Broadview Street Monday afternoon alerted drivers to the damage.</p>

<p>The branch from a silver maple that is among the few remaining trees that loom large over the street appeared to have broken away as the inside of the tree hollowed out and weakened.</p>

<p>Public Works responded shortly after being notified. They cleared the road Earlier in the week, work crews were busy replacing gas lines directly under the same tree.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
