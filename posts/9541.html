In addition, PrEP, preventative medication, can be taken to prevent infection for people at a high risk of becoming infected.<br><br>The Bristol Mayor’s Task Force, created in 1991, continues to reach out to the community with a variety of educational programs and an emphasis on prevention and awareness for a broad range of people at risk of infection and helps to provide resources and services for those who are infected and affected.&nbsp;<br><br>In April, the Task Force’s annual professional development workshop will be offered for medical and social service staff involved in HIV-related care.&nbsp;The Task Force meets monthly at City Hall and its members reflect different aspects of the Bristol community.&nbsp; For those interested in local testing sites, they can be found at:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/AIDS--Chronic-Diseases/Prevention/List-of-HIV-Counseling-and-Testing-Site" target="_blank">https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/AIDS--Chronic-Diseases/Prevention/List-of-HIV-Counseling-and-Testing-Site</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>For more information about the Mayor’s Task Force, its programs and community projects contact the Task Force through its Facebook page&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/The-City-of-Bristol-Mayors-Task-Force-on-HIVAIDS-107844210671345" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/The-City-of-Bristol-Mayors-Task-Force-on-HIVAIDS-107844210671345</a>.<br><br>--</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
