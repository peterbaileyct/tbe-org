<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern boys basketball team getting to the pay window last Thursday night wasn’t a complete surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters downed Plainville 54-24 to start the season with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was the way the team did it over a suffocating second half defensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was only a six point game at the half (23-17) but when Eastern went to it’s 2-3 zone defense, the Blue Devils couldn’t find a way to score the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville was limited to 25-percent shooting at the half and then that tally completely fell off a cliff over the final 16 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad connected on just 3-of-20 shots the rest of the way (15-percent), leading to a historic victory for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won by thirty points, it’s largest margin of victory ever in an opening night game, surpassing the 75-48 victory Eastern tallied at home versus Rockville back on December 17, 1993 (don’t forget, Bristol Eastern’s own Mr. Stavens attended Rockville High School and was cheering&nbsp;<em>against&nbsp;</em>our local heroes on the hardwood).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the 24 points allowed by the Lancers was the fewest ever allowed by the Lancers during an opening game over its 64 year history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The old record was established back on December 22, 1981, when Eastern turned away St. Paul by a 43-33 final in the Lancers’ 1980-81 opener.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means it’s time to take a stroll back through time and look at both those new records the current Eastern squad managed to reestablish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern’s old record for widest margin of victory on opening night:&nbsp;</strong>27 points (75-48 win), established on December 17, 1993.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Game:&nbsp;</strong>The Lancers went on a huge second period run to eventually capture the 27 point win or the Indians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, Eastern was led by a team of 10 seniors strong and simply overwhelmed Rockville that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Todd Ziogas, the uncle of Bristol Central’s Sophia Torreso, pumped in 19 points to lead a very balanced scoring attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed 12-8 after eight minutes of play but a suffocating 16-0 second period burst by Eastern ended any lingering suspense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Lancers outscored Rockville 27-6 in the frame and never trailed again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ziogas also wrangled up three rebounds, seven assists and four steals over his usual complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current Eastern assistant coach Chris D’Amato added 14 points, Brenden Floyd zipped in eight points - canning two three-pointers along the way - while Mike Farrell and Derek Whitehead (seven rebounds) each posted seven points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers won its first CCC South title that season, going 18-4 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Old Record for fewest points allowed by the Lancers on opening night:&nbsp;</strong>33 points (43-33 win), established on December 22, 1981.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the decade of the 80s commenced, the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team was a local power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And during the 1981-82 campaign, the Lancers scooped up 20 wins and were coming off its one and only state championship appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the 10-point victory against St. Paul, Eastern’s David Nye led the locals with a tremendous 19 point scoring effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had a tremendous campaign that year, going 20-5 overall behind the efforts of Tim Curtin, Doug Pina, and Nye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That team, the Colonial Conference champs at 9-1, was ranked second overall in the Region III playoffs and made it all the way to the semifinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern dropped a tough 54-44 decision to No. 1 Crosby on March 24 to end another memorable season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be the final game for Eastern coach Jim Bates as Mike Giovinazzo took over the squad for the 1982-83 season.</p>
