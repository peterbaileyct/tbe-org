<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team got back to the pay window on Thursday night, blasting Platt by a 47-28 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second straight victory by the Lancers, third in four games, while the Panthers fell to 7-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was another stellar performance by Eastern’s All-State talent Ciara Collins as she nearly tallied a 30-20 - just one point and two rebounds away from achieving that tremendous feat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She blasted in game-highs of 29 points and 18 rebounds - nine coming off the offensive glass - while also tallying two assists, five blocks, and five steals over a tremendous effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez added 13 points, nine rebounds, and two steals and was excellent in support of Collins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent had a tough shooting night but still contributed three points, four rebounds, three assists, and two steals for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow starters Emily Piendak (two rebounds) and Vanessa Drury (two assists, two steals) also contributed to the victorious effort while Lauren Ayotte added three boards off the bench, Leah Roy nabbed two steals, and Gracie LaMar gave good minutes in support of the starters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabby Piendak,&nbsp;Madison Charette, Tavia Swain, and Grace Brown all got into the game for the Lancers in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt’s Khrystena Campbell notched 22 of the squad’s 28 points over the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was a real battle early but a 3 by Collins with 4:30 left to play in the first quarter made it a 9-5 contest in Eastern’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers couldn’t sustain the moment as Platt caught up to end the first frame, making it an 11-11 game though one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern couldn’t shake Campbell as she drilled a hoop but missed the ensuing foul shot with about five minutes to play in the second stanza as Platt led it, 17-15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the visiting aggression did not score again in the stanza as Eastern limited the Panthers to 33-percent shooting (8-of-24) by the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Eastern ended the half on an 8-0 push as Parent hit the go-ahead 3 while Collins canned two free throws and drained a 3 - off a slick pass from Parent - as the Kingstreeters led it, 23-17 at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt started the third tilt by missing seven straight field goals as Eastern outscored the Panthers, 8-4, in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins hit for six straight Eastern points and late in the third, Ayotte found Gonzalez for a high-percentage bucket and with eight minutes to play, it was a 31-21 game in the Lancers’ favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Platt scored the first basket of the fourth frame, Eastern netted 12 straight points to ice the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins drained her third 3 and when Gonzalez cashed in on a conventional three-point play, it was a 37-23 contest with less than six minutes to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez then added two more field goals and when Roy made a steal and a hoop, it was a 43-23 game and all but over as Eastern eventually wrapped up a 19-point victory to get to .500 on the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
