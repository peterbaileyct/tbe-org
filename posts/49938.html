<p>This upcoming community day is a fan favorite. Pokémon GO’s August Community Day Pokémon is Popplio! During this day, Trainers a have an opportunity to evolve to at Primarina that knows the Water type charged attack Hydro Cannon. It's also been revealed that Primarina will be able to learn Sparkling Aria from the beginning of this Community Day event. It will be appearing more frequently in the wild. If you’re lucky, you may encounter a Shiny one! </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Pokémon GO World Championships just ended. The Pokémon World Championships isn’t just a both a gathering for all the best competitive Pokémon players across the globe, but also a pseudo–Pokémon Presents showcase to talk about the future of the franchise. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event was held in Hawaii this year, so its closing ceremony took place late at night for many people around the globe. They dropped two features that will change the game on how battles are done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokémon Go got two announcements during the closing ceremony, but one was easily the bigger deal. Developer Niantic teased that Dynamaxing, the battle gimmick from Pokémon Sworld and Shield, is finally coming to Pokémon Go. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These temporary transformations allow Pokémon to grow like a Godzilla, with some getting original forms called Gigantamax that are distinct from a typical Dynamax form. The feature was teased with a live-action trailer showing what appears to be a Dynamax Pokémon descending upon a beach. Tune in and watch all the action beginning at 9 a.m. each day!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, during the Pokémon Go segment, Niantic revealed Morpeko, the Galar region’s Pikachu clone, is coming to the app “soon.” Pokémon Go still hasn’t fully rolled out Generation VIII’s Pokédex, though it has sporadically released critters from the Sword and Shield games over the years. Hopefully Dynamax and Morpeko are signs that more are on the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the Global Challenges will take place throughout the Triumph Together event! Work with Trainers around the world to complete them and unlock bonuses for all to enjoy! Once a challenge is completed, special bonuses and Timed Research will be unlocked for the remainder of the event and the next Global Challenge will begin. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
