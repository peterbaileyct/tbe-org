<p>Over the past few months, Josie assembled a personal portfolio to be reviewed by a panel of judges. On the day of the Youth of the Year ceremony, she gave a speech in front of the panel and then participated in a 15-minute interview.</p>

<p>When asked about the impact The Club had on her life Josie replied, “It was the place that I knew I could always fall back on. It was a place where I knew I could go and find someone that always wanted the best for me.”</p>

<p>Josie said she first started coming to the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bristol when she was enrolled in our School-Based Programs while attending elementary school and has been a member of The Club for 10 years. Now a member of our prestigious Keystone Club, a club within the club for exemplary teen leaders, Josie uses her knowledge and skills to lead and inspire youth to dream big.</p>

<p>Josie, who is currently a sophomore attending Bristol Central High School, is looking forward to her new role as Youth of the Year.</p>

<p>Since 1948, Youth of the Year has been Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America’s premier recognition program. It is a celebration of the extraordinary achievements of club teens and is the highest honor a "Club Kid" can receive.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Club members who earn the Youth of the Year title embody the values of leadership service, academic excellence, and healthy lifestyles. They exemplify the critical impact that Boys Girls Clubs have on the lives of young people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being named the 2024 Bristol Youth of the Year means that Josephine will serve as both an exemplary ambassador for Club youth, and as a strong voice for teens in the community.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
