<p>MIDDLETOWN - The Bristol and Middletown American Legion baseball programs waged an entertaining battle from Palmer Field on Thursday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Post 75 was able to flip a one run deficit into an eventual 4-2 triumph in a Zone 3 confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 fell to 4-5-4 overall off the losing effort while Middletown improved to 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel Laphem (five innings, two runs, four walks, six strikeouts) won the contest for Middletown but Bristol chucker Gavin Colvin also held his own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though he’s 0-2 on the Senior level this season, Colvin battled well over 4.1 innings on the hill (seven hits, just one walk).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were down a few guys tonight, but I thought Gavin threw well,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “He threw the other day against West Hartford. He did okay and I thought he threw really well today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was afoot quickly as Bristol’s Nick Sconziano (double) walked on four straight balls, moving to second on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he got gunned down at third base on an Elliot Norris groundout and Post 2 never put a runner back in scoring position over the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Post 75 generated a run in the bottom of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Ryan Quinn was plunked by a pitch, stole second and scored on a scorched single down the right field line by Corey Turcotte to give Middletown a 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was active in the second stanza as Cole Caccamo (2-for-2, run) walked and EJ Sanchez slipped in an infield hit by the shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With runners on first and second, three straight putouts saw Middletown escape a huge jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colvin threw strikes in the second, inducing a 1-2-3 inning, as Post 2 was looking to crack the [working] scoreboard in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was an eventful third for Bristol - all with two outs on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris smacked out an infield hit, a slow roller to second base, and Jayden Churchill reached first via fielder’s choice before tomfoolery ensued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the Churchill grounder, Elliot strayed too far off third base and got caught in a rundown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the ball was eventually thrown away at third base, Norris got back to the bag safely while Churchill arrived at second during the broken play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with runners on second and third, Caccamo slammed an RBI single to center, squaring up the showdown at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, it was ‘Bristol pickle’ time with runners on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a pitch or two in on Sanchez, Caccamo broke from first and started dancing nearly halfway down to second base, baiting the defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the focus was on Caccamo, Churchill eventually made his way cautiously down the third base line and then broke for home, easily scoring, as Post 2 nabbed a 2-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown responded in the third, taking the lead for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Quinn dumped a single into center, scoring AJ Quinn (2-for-4) from second base, to draw the contest even at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Quinn quickly stole second and third and with two away, Tyler Powell hit a clutch RBI base hit to right - scoring Ryan Quinn - to put Post 75 ahead 3-2 through three tilts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Middletown is decent,” said LaPenta. “They’re in second place but it wasn’t like anything we can’t beat.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quiet Bristol fourth, Middletown’s Spencer Stahl blasted a ball near the line in left that was tracking towards the left field line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Josh Dune made one heck of an effort to track down and nearly grab the ball, but it fell in for a hit and Mason Neumann scored from third as the home team captured a 4-2 cushion through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 put two on with two outs in the top of the fifth as Churchill walked and Caccamo beat out an infield hit to first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after a fly-out by Sanchez, the threat was squashed as Post 75 kept its two-run push intact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought we hit the ball hard,” said LaPenta. “We hit balls right at them. It’s just baseball.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the fifth, Powell was plunked by a ball and Spencer Misenti walked as Josh Dunne came in for Colvin, firing rockets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the inning, Silas Barrett flew out to Declan Schenck in left, who took a bit of a tumble on the play, but the fielder maintained control of the ball as Bristol entered the top of the sixth down by two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was retired in order during the sixth while Josh Dunne held the fort over his 1.2 innings of relief, allowing just a two out triple to AJ Quinn but to end the frame, the runner was stranded at third base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Josh came in and did a nice job,” said LaPenta of Dunne. “If he keeps throwing like that, it’s nice for us to have another arm.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol made one last ditch effort at it with in the top of the seventh as Sconziano flipped a deep-dish double to right and with one out, the tying run was at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Sconziano never advanced as Bristol dropped a tough 4-2 decision on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our whole goal of this is to be playing our best in the end when you get into the playoffs,” said LaPenta. “We’ll see where we go but I thought we played well tonight.”</p>
