<p>Generations of Bristol residents filled Memorial Boulevard to celebrate the 61st Annual Bristol Mum Festival. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The beloved community event, spanning from Friday night through Sunday, brought a weekend filled with food, live music, arts and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The festivities commenced under clear skies with temperatures in the high 60s on Friday night with the “Hometown Heroes” opening ceremonies. This year's honorees were the Bristol Police Department, with Police Chief Brian Gould serving as the 2023 festival Grand Marshall.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I feel so privileged to be here tonight,” said Gould. “So privileged to serve. We are Bristol, we are one, we’re all heart, and we are, Bristol -- say it -- Strong!” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A large and lively crowd, numbering in the hundreds, gathered at BAIMS field on opening night to&nbsp;celebrate this year’s festival theme, “Mumma Mia, Here We Grow Again.”&nbsp;As the sun began to set, the stage came alive with music performed by Fleetwood Mac tribute band Fleetwood Macked. The large and lively crowd sang and danced along to their renditions of classics like "Say You Love Me."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The midway was a bustling hub of activity with festival-goers eager to experience the thrills of the Ferris wheel, the whimsy of the funhouse and the challenge of traditional carnival games. The sweet scent of cotton candy and popcorn wafted through the air, enticing guests to indulge in traditional festival sweet treats. </p>

<p>The diverse array of local food trucks featured throughout the weekend offered something for every palate to enjoy. Among the eclectic culinary delight available were hamburgers, tacos, grilled chicken, mac and cheese, gourmet tater tots and baked stuffed potatoes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The food is the best part of this whole thing for me,” said Jay Dennehy. “I already had a couple of tacos, some fries and I’m thinking about what to grab next. It’s all so good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite heavy rainfall and unseasonably cool temperatures, festivalgoers braved the elements to partake in the festivities on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A plethora of family-friendly activities and events offered hours of fun for younger attendees. Children visited their favorite costumed characters like Batman and Ariel before stopping to pet friendly farm animals at the petting zoo. Attendees also had the opportunity to explore more than 100 local vendors, from local artisans showcasing their creative wares to community organizations reaching out to greet the public.</p>

<p>Spectators, donning ponchos and carrying umbrellas, lined the streets of downtown Bristol on Sunday to witness the grandeur of the Mum Festival parade. Community members representing local organizations marched proudly from Race Street to North Main Street amidst a stunning array of exquisitely crafted floats.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The best part of this for me is everyone coming together,” said Jamie Perchiano. “I love it: all the food, the music, and especially seeing everyone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mum Festival is produced by the Bristol Exchange Club of Connecticut, Inc., and is sponsored by the City of Bristol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
