<p>BERLIN – The Bristol Central boys track and field team picked up right where it left off last season and that meant more winning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, the Rams traveled to Berlin for its season opener and was able to hang a 109-41 loss on the Redcoats in CCC South action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was a history making day for Central as senior standout Tre Blair, who was one of two athletes that won four events that day, established a new school record in the triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair made a leap of 45 feet, 5.5 inches – breaking the standard set by Drew Lee back in 2015 (44 feet, nine inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair also dominated in the high jump (five feet, eight inches), long jump (21 feet, 4.5 inches) and was one of the winning members of the 4x100 meter relay team along with Anthony Paulino, Jimmy Cantarero, and Logan Jackson (46.96 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along those lines, Central’s Frankie Porrini was also a four-event winner in Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini nabbed first place times in the 800 meters (2:07.94), 1600 (4:41.67) and 3200 (12:12) events and helped the 4x400 meter relay squad to the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Rowan Hennessey, Porrini, Patrick Wininger, and Julieen Lopez took the event in a finish of 3:46.59.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson dominated both hurdle events, placing first in the 110 (17.45 seconds) and 300 (44.57) while the crew from Central won the 4x800 meter relay as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger, Lopez, Chris Roy, and Lance Archibald finished the challenge in 9:01.43.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other wins for the Rams came from Tashawn Cauley (shot put, 36 feet, eight inches), Noel Ramirez (discus, 90 feet, seven inches) and Wyatt Gibson (javelin, 125 feet, five inches).</p>

<p>“[The] Bristol Central boys track and field team had a great first dual meet against Berlin, especially after losing a strong senior class,” said Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “We are off to a great start and the rebuilding has begun!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, April 18, the Rams will be back in CCC South action as Middletown comes to the city limits for a meet starting at 3:45 p.m. from the track and field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons lost their opening meet at Plainville on April 4 by a 96-54 final.</p>
