<p>Family was most important to Mary and she was a parishioner of St. Joseph Church, Bristol. Mary is survived by two sons: Robert S.

<p>Growing up in a house of six children during the Depression, she lost her Mom at the age of five. Not having a mother, her desire was to live long enough to see her children grown, so she set out to be the world’s best Mom, an achievement she truly attained. Auntie Mary (Auntie La La) sang while working around the most inviting home ever. Friends and family alike were always welcome and knew they were someplace special because she was there. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
