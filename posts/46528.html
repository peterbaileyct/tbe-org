<p>The Bristol girls youth lacrosse senior and junior programs both entered postseason play this past week and both saw their seasons come to a close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Senior team (6th, 7th and 8th graders) traveled to the #1 seed Avon to face off at Fisher Meadows. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result was a 13-4 loss but the contest had some spirited play from some of the girls headed to high school next year. The scoring was led by Bristol Central-bound Greta Hennessey. She was able to win several draws and got herself in scoring position several times. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern-bound Mya Hatcher and Klaudia Twardy did well on the draw and at defense. Hatcher had several key plays and nearly saw the back of the net several times. BE-bound Ella Smith was a critical defender and stopped the Avon attack from setting into position. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charlotte Procko did well in goal while Serena Croce provided boundless energy on offense and defense. Makinzey Welch found the back of the net and had many more chances.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol junior team traveled to Hall High School to take on the #1 seed West Hartford. The Bristol team played at a disadvantage from the opening draw as they only had ten players to take on West Hartford's twelve. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the fight and heart Bristol showed was tremendous. Natalia Dejesus and Venezia Lodovico split goalie duties. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Bell, Abby Stavens and Lucy Smith had primary middie duties and did well on the draw and ground balls. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kerry Young was spectacular on defense and was backed by Emma Campbell and Keisha Smith. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riley Michaud and Ava Bunker split time between attack and defense and came up with several key plays as the Badgers entered the 4th quarter down 7-3. However the heat factor and Bristol’s lack of a full squad slowed the team down and they ended with a 9-3 loss.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
