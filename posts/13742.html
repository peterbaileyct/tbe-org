<p>The weather that came through Bristol over the course of the early afternoon on Wednesday was just enough to knockout the Class LL second round feature between the Bristol Central (19-4) and Cheshire (18-3) softball programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rain poured down at a brisk pace and though it quickly came and went, it soaked the softball field at BCHS and all that saturation was too much to overcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several school employees worked on the field trying to restore it for the game as Cheshire’s squad was on the BC campus, waiting inside the cafeteria and hoping the showdown would commence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The umpires showed up on time and with Bristol Athletic Director Chris Cassin on the scene, it was determined that the field was unplayable and the showdown was postponed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 5 Central advanced in first round play with a 6-0 shutout over No. 28 Wilton while No. 12 Cheshire spun No. 21 Simsbury 11-1 on Tuesday – advancing in the Class LL bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is worthy of note that up the street, the Class M second round game between No. 8 Wolcott and No. 9 Stonington was washed out as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To beat the rain, Wolcott’s game is slated for later today at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Critical Upset</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of the Class LL teams around the state played on Wednesday and a critical upset might have just opened another home game for Central – if the field is ready for play by then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 13 Trumbull upset No. 4 Glastonbury in an amazing 2-1 final over 10 innings to knock the higher seed out, meaning the winner of Central/Cheshire will host a quarterfinal game on Friday (weather permitting).</p>

<p><strong>Busy Wednesday Slate</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other action in the Class LL bracket on Wednesday, No. 1 Danbury needed an extra inning to shake No. 16 Shelton (3-1) while No. 8 West Haven just snuck by No. 24 West Haven (6-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the rest of the bracket went according to plan as No. 2 Southington (10-0 over No. 18 Norwalk), No. 10 Maloney (18-6 versus No. 26 Conard in six innings), No. 3 Fairfield Ludlowe (9-0 winner against No. 19 Fairfield Warde), and No. 6 Hall (3-2 victor over No. 11 Naugatuck) all advanced to quarterfinal round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central eventually makes its way into the semifinals, a date with top-seeded Danbury could be on the docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 8 West Haven is also in the mix but that contest would be played from a neutral site somewhere around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>All-State Honors for Torreso</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso has been one of the driving forces for Central this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between throwing from the mound, manning first base, and getting timely hits from the dish, Torreso’s versatility has been on display all year long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for all her hard work, the junior standout earned CIAC Class LL All-State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am very thankful for this high school season so far,” said Torreso via Twitter. “I am grateful to have made the All Conference team for [the] CCC, the LL All State team, and am so excited to play in the JR All Star Game!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Junior All-Star Game will be played on June 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso also thanked her stellar catcher, Lorelei Stancavage, and the excellent defense behind her when she’s pitching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along those same lines, pitching sensation Alex Sciarretto, Stancavage and Torreso earned spots on the CCC South All-Conference team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central/Cheshire to square off on Thursday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s game against Cheshire is rescheduled for today at 4 p.m. in Bristol with – of course – more rain in the forecast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the locals, it’s simply win and stay home if Central can defeat a very good Cheshire program.</p>
