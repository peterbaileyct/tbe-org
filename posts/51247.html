<p><br>Southington (2-2-1) eked out a win over Bristol Eastern (1-4-1), by a score of 1-0 Thursday night in a CCC contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first half was scoreless, but Eastern had more chances to score as they had numerous free kicks and corner kicks that were hit into the Southington penalty area.  However, the Knights' backs were able to clear the ball or the Lancers were unable to get a good shot on goal.</p>

<p>"It was a difficult evening as we had numerous chances, but no one to take advantage of them," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.  "Southington took their best chance and scored the game winner."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Jekubovich took a Kevin O'Neill pass at the top of the Eastern area, beat his man and sent a shot past a diving Connor Murtaugh at 33:58 of the second half.</p>

<p>Eastern continued to threaten the Southing goal, with fine play by Sam LaMar, Drew Viens, and Alex Szynal in the back,  winning balls and starting the attack.   Hunter Scott on the right side sent sharp crosses into the Southington penalty area, but no one could knock one home.</p>

<p>Murtaugh had six saves while Southington’s Jonathan Plourde made nine.</p>
