<p>The Falcon offense got going early scoring 7 runs in the bottom of the 1st inning. After a lead off single by Logan Rembish, Rembish stole 2nd, stole 3rd, and scored on a throwing error. Then a walk to Devin Kulas was followed by five consecutive hits: an RBI double by Cal Chance, RBI singles by Cole Raymond, Ryan Kilpatrick, and Jonathan Remillard, and a single by Bryce Adamski. Remillard and Adamski later scored on an infield error, and St. Paul led 7-0 after one.</p>
