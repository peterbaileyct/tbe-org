<p>Homeowners, renters, landlords and family childcare homes may qualify for the free removal of lead paint from their properties by applying for funds through a new program announced by Gov. Ned Lamont yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lead Free CT, a new campaign overseen by the Connecticut Department of Public Health with the goal of protecting children from the harmful health impacts of lead and creating a lead-free Connecticut, has multiple objectives, but a key component is its lead abatement program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Homes built before 1978 often contain lead that is harmful to children, the release states. Properties where a pregnant person or child under 6 years lives may be eligible for free abatement. For eligibility, through the Connecticut Children's Healthy Homes Program, click <a href="https://leadfreect.org/">here</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a limited-time program, so the sooner the application process begins the better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program's objectives include the following:</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
