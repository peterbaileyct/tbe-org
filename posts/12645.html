<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - A lot has transpired after the Bristol Central baseball team made its 4-2 comeback against Rocky Hill on Friday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that’s a topic for another day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that triumph against the Terriers, the Rams fell at Middletown by a 9-2 final on Saturday - falling to 2-5 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But since starting the season at 0-3, Central has been playing .500 ball ever since and is hoping to ride a wave of momentum over the next six games - all to be played from the friendly confines of Bristol in one capacity or another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The last couple days have been tough at practice just talking about mental toughness and emotional toughness,” said current Central coach Bunty Ray after his squad came from behind to pick off Rocky Hill on Friday. “That’s where we’re at.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Injuries have played a bit of havoc with senior JT Clark, still suffering from a hand injury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was able to see some time in that Rocky Hill victory in a pitch-running capacity but is itching to get back on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is still getting players experience on the fly but this team simply doesn’t show any quit and is a bit better than its current 2-5 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Physically, we’re a little under matched in certain spots,” said Ray. “But I’m going to be honest with you, the scrappiness out there [has been good].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Aiden Lopez (second base) is a rising star, seeing early time as several players in a Bristol Central uniform have over the past years under Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Christian Stafford (third base) is getting better by the game while sophomore Oscar Kuzniar (DH) is settling into his role quite nicely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a competitor,” said Ray of Kuzniar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Michael Allen (shortstop), senior Bryan Capezzone (left field), senior Zach Vanasse (centerfield), and sophomore Anthony Santilli (right field) have joined forces with veterans such as Frank Spirito (infield, pitcher), Ryan Ring (catcher), and Clark to form an ever-improving unit - and giving every team a run this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been competitive in every game,” said Ray. “It’s just a matter of us being able to do what we need to do to win.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take out the Middletown game and the Rams lost to Maloney (7-2), Plainville (4-3) in nine innings, Avon (7-4), and Simsbury (3-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was simply one hit away in some of those encounters from tying up the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hill for Central, sophomore Nate Pirog has earned both wins for the program while Spirito has collected two saves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a great 1-2 punch for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito is tough in a starting role as well and the duo have kept the Rams extremely competitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love our pitching right now. Our pitching staff has done great,” said Ray. “It’s defensively and offensively that we need to be better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the 2022 campaign, there truly isn’t any team from the Central Connecticut Conference that has been on fire out the gate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s plenty of parity in the CCC, and the CCC South specifically, as Central is still in the hunt despite being three games under .500 to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These teams are all the same,” said Ray of the CCC. “They’re scrappy, they’re tough. I don’t think anybody’s really that much head-and-shoulders above anyone else. I think whoever's going to come out and executes and does the little things are going to win these games. For us, it’s just a matter of us staying in the game long enough so we have a chance to win it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If these kids get a little bit of confidence, watch out. They’re not going to go away. They’re going to keep getting better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Central is home for three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams welcome Maloney on Monday, Platt comes to town on Wednesday (both games commence at 3:45 p.m.) while Plainville travels to Bristol on Saturday for a special 1 p.m. bout.</p>
