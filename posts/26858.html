<p>Last Wednesday, the Bristol Youth Lacrosse Senior girls program went to work from Santana Field in Southington in the final league match of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the grass field from Southington High School, the squad from Bristol downed the Southington White team by a 9-4 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals remained undefeated this year, highlighted by a tremendous offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harper Dauphinee and Savannah Drury each splashed in four goals apiece while Riley Bashaw nailed an excellent shot for a score against Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makinzey Welch found Bashaw for that goal to pace the offensive onslaught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the regular season is nearing its completion, the Bristol program scored 122 goals at one point this year, tops in the league, while the 34 goals allowed was an amazing tally over that same stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s the defense that fueled Bristol at Southington, along with its play off the bench, that has complemented the offense so well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teague Freimuth has been a tremendous goalie for the Bristol program, slowing the Southington attack with save after save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Teagan has been solid all season with several blocked shots each week,” said Bristol coach Chuck Drury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that defensive rotation is tough with the likes of McKenna Bell, Bella Alves, Ella Smith, Kenzie Ciechoski, along with Chloe LaBrecque, making critical stops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Chloe LaBrecque had a great game defending and keeping possessions for the team,” said Drury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natalia Vye has been mixing it up as of late, putting opponent's goalies under fire, and did so against Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this squad has big time players at several key positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A frequent starter and key contributor has been Amelia Daliga,” said Drury. “Amelia has been successful creating turnovers several games this season and took a couple coast to coast for scores.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These complete match efforts have fueled the Bristol program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The players continue to put in the work and have become extremely successful in this growing sport in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The future is bright for the Bristol lacrosse program with speedsters Melia Belden and Allison Craig keeping opponents on their heels,” said Drury. “Off the bench, our core sixth grade group of Macey Bashaw, Yuliya Samolyuk and Serena Croce have kept many possessions alive for the team this season while playing on the Junior team as well.”</p>
