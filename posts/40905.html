<p>According to the lunatic fringe, a shadowy group rigs the Super Bowl to control public sentiment and social behavior.</p>

<p><em>Jesus Marim</em>ba. Well, here's one the GMB heard moments ago: </p>

<p>Vegans, Grover Norquist, and the Mum City's Supreme leaders meet in the underground tunnels beneath city hall to decipher coded messages hidden within the 10-cent bottle redemption program about how to manipulate global events. </p>

<p>Speaking of conspiracies, the Planning Commission is the latest Bristol government meeting to fall victim to online audio problems. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, fellas, this is easy -- audio out to audio in and video out to video in. Also, that long thing on a gooseneck it’s called a microphone. It's used to “amplify” sound. Unless, of course, that's the intent, you don't want "the people" to know. Doo doo doo do; doo doo doo do.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
