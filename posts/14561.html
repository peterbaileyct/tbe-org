<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Junior American Legion baseball program is hanging in at 7-6 the season - winners of four of its five past games, which included a 10-8 victory over the squad from Windsor Locks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Post 2 dropped a tough 2-1 decision to West Hartford on June 19, the locals fell to 3-5 and were several games back of Zone 1 leaders West Hartford and Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But since that time, Bristol has been on complete fire - posting wins over RCP, the Windsor Locks coop, Glastonbury, and Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has scored 34 runs over that stretch - becoming a scoring juggernaut as the last couple weeks of the campaign are approaching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all started on June 25 as Post 2 sent RCP packing by an 8-4 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following Monday, Bristol dropped Windsor Locks (10-8) but fell against EHM (9-4) from McKenna Field in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitching shutout its past two opponents, getting above .500, as the July 4 holiday commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, June 30, Post 2 defeated Glastonbury by a single run (1-0) and on the first day in July, Bristol smoked Meriden, 11-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio went the distance against RCP, throwing a 96 pitch, four run, five hit gem as Bristol scored three runs over the first and second frames to secure a 6-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol hung on to win by four runs (8-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Windsor Locks program, Post 2 used four pitchers as Mitch Crowley (1-1) earned the victory over his 1.1 innings of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isaac Roberge, Michael Roalf, and Rio Fernandez all saw time on the mound for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s one run win over Glastonbury saw Maglio (3-1) win again, needing just 86 pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He zipped up a four hit complete game outing and then against Meriden, Roalf (2-1) threw a one-hitter as Post 2 moved to 7-6 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, Bristol has three contests to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 travels to battle West Hartford on Tuesday (July 5, 5:30 p.m.), plays Simsbury on Friday (5:30 p.m., Riley Field) and compete against Northeast 17U on Saturday (1 p.m., Riley Field).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Sunday, Post 2 is currently four games behind Simsbury (11-2) and three and-a-half behind West Hartford (10-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since going 0-2 to start the season, Simsbury has won 11 straight.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol isn’t too far behind that mark with several games left to be played.</p>
