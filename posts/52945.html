<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut residents will head to the polls this November to cast ballots for president, U.S. Congress and state legislative races. Many will have questions about where to vote, how to vote and for whom to vote when Election Day rolls around. The Connecticut Mirror, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization, is here to help with its first-ever voter guide – a comprehensive look at the key dates to know ahead of Nov. 5, a one-stop-shop for election-related questions, and a place to find answers about who is running in your district.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any questions we haven’t answered here?&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ktorres-ocasio@ctmirror.org">Send us an email</a>&nbsp;and we’ll try to answer them for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Am I eligible to vote?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut residents are eligible to vote if they are turning 18 on or before Election Day and are a U.S. citizen. If a person has been convicted of a felony, they must also have completed confinement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do I register to vote?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those <a href="https://portaldir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eligible to vote</a> can either visit the state’s <a href="https://voterregistration.ct.gov/OLVR/welcome.do">online voter registration portal</a> to sign up or can <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/sots/election-services/register-to-vote/voter-registration-application-english-and-spanish">download a paper form</a> in English or Spanish and mail it in to your town’s registrar of voters office. The deadline to register by these methods is Oct. 18. For applications that are mailed in, the application must be postmarked or received by that date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What if I miss the deadline? Can I vote on Election Day or during early voting?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Connecticut does have Same Day Registration available, but those looking to use this registration tool cannot do it at their regular polling location on Election Day. Towns designate&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.ct.gov/sots/election-services/election-day-registration/election-day-registration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Same Day Registration</a>&nbsp;locations and these are posted online by the Secretary of the State’s office one or two weeks before Election Day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the contrary, during the early voting period, you can register every day at the early voting location. You will need to bring a photo ID and proof of residency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tell me about early voting. Who can vote? When does it begin? Where do I go?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone eligible to vote in the general election can vote during the&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sots/education/early-voting/2024_digital_brochures/english/early_voting_2024_general_election_digital_brochure_english_color.pdf">early voting</a>&nbsp;period. Early voting begins 14 days before the general election, on Oct. 21, and runs through Nov. 3, including weekends. Voting hours will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, except Oct. 29 and Oct. 31, when the voting hours will be extended to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting locations will be posted closer to Election Day at <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/sots/election-services/voter-information/voter-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MyVote.CT.gov</a> or can be obtained by calling 860-509-6200.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Are polling locations the same on Election Day as they are during early voting?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. Early voting locations can and will be different from regular polling locations. To find out where to cast a ballot on Election Day, registered voters can visit the secretary of the state’s voter registration lookup and polling place locator <a href="https://portaldir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What time are the polls open?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. If you are in line at 8 p.m. you will still be able to vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Do I need to bring an ID to vote?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you are given a ballot at the polls, you will be asked to provide a government-issued ID, a different ID with your name and photo, or a document like a utility bill or checkbook that has your name and address. If you can not provide any of these, you will be asked to sign an affidavit instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Can I vote by using an absentee or mail-in ballot?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Connecticut, you are only allowed to vote by mail for one of the following reasons: you’re an active member of the U.S. military; you will be out of town on Election Day; you will be serving as an election official at a different polling location; you can’t vote for religious reasons that day; or sickness or a physical disability will prevent you from making it to the polls on Election Day.<strong>I</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong> qualify to vote by absentee. How do I get an absentee ballot?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To apply, voters can request the ballot online or by completing a paper application and returning it to their local town clerk. A ballot will then be mailed to you. Ballots can be returned by using the United States Postal Service, in person at the town clerk’s office or in a drop box in your town. All ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I’m a college student. How do I vote?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>College students can vote in one of two ways: either vote by absentee ballot in your hometown or register to vote in your college town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Besides candidates to vote for, are there any questions for voters on the ballot?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Connecticut voters&nbsp;<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/09/02/ct-no-excuse-absentee-voting-ballot-question/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be asked</a>&nbsp;whether the state constitution should be amended to allow all voters to cast their ballots by mail, commonly known as no-excuse absentee voting. If the measure passes, the General Assembly could pass a law expanding mail-in voting to all voters. Lawmakers could raise a bill about the issue as soon this January.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While much of the media attention has been focused on the presidential election, Connecticut residents will also be casting ballots in five races for the&nbsp;U.S. House of Representatives and one U.S. Senate race this November. The winners will not only work alongside the incoming president but will also help shape the effectiveness and efficiency of Congress.</p>
