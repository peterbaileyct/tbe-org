<p>EUGENE, OREGON – Bristol Central’s Frankie Porrini was back at it again on Sunday – running at the 2022 Nike Outdoor Nationals, the final day of the event from Hayward Field in Tracktown USA in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a tremendous finish in the 2K steeplechase the previous day, it was his turn to take the track for the 800 meters (Emerging Elite).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Porrini made it a race to remember by the time he crossed the finish line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished the event in 1:56.78 – a personal record and another time under two minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini’s time was actually 1:56.774, good for ninth place in the heat while Austin Desisto (Westfield, Massachusetts) finished in 10th at 1:56.776, just an eyelash behind Porrini.</p>

<p>“[It was] another great day for Frankie Porrini on the track at Historic Hayward Field in Tracktown USA!” Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk said. “He won his heat in the emerging elite 800 with a new personal record of 1:56.74. [What a] way to get after it this weekend. Your BC Ramily is so proud of you.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the top nine finishes of the race, three athletes ended the day with new personal bests which included Porrini’s outstanding time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the top two finishers of the 800 on Sunday established new career times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colin Abrams (Derwood, Maryland) won the 800 meters in 1:52.56 while the runner-up, Jackson Monz (Rockstars Track Club, Utah), finished in 1:54.52.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini had a tremendous couple days out on the West Coast, representing Bristol Central extremely well between the 800 and his fifth place finish in Boys 2000 Steeplechase on Saturday (6:03.42).</p>

<p><strong>Blair in Philadelphia</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And from the 2022 New Balance Nationals at Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Central’s Tre Blair took part in the triple jump event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While he did not place over a loaded field, it was good experience for the junior competitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Central Track and Field is so proud of our guy Treshawn Blair!” Stafford-Kirk said. “[It was] not the day he wanted at New Balance Nationals. Champions know continued commitment brings better days…Bristol Central Track and Field always has your back. Can’t wait for Track and Field 2023."</p>
