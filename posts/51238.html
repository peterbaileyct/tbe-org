<p>Come Sunday morning, the cool weather--but no rain--will have started to make its way into our daily routine. The hanging plants on the porch are still holding their own, if they get watered, which I take care of. The grass in the front yard, where the water main was replaced, is filling in, and watering it helps--Mary's contribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the holly bush that was temporarily moved for the water main repair is laboring, and even with the extra watering, may not be able to turn the corner.</p>

<p>This week I have been taking in a fair share of information about A.I. There have been a bunch of podcasts, two of which I will recommend, even though they are on the longer side. (Note: The podcasts have transcripts for those who are readers.)  Then there are new offerings on Netflix--A series that features Bill Gates, and other documentaries that, over 10 or so episodes, breakdown what it is that A.I. offers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before that, I took a respite from the technical side to read some essays by Robert Louis Stevenson, yes the author of "Treasure Island" and other favorites. My knowledge of R.L.S. goes back to third grade in Mrs. Toomajian's class and his poem, "The Block City." Third grade was a critical year for me as a reader--as I think it is for most kids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This poem, though, struck a nerve. Its lines and rhyming were--and still are--magic. And with the book where it is found, "A Child's Garden of Verses," available in the public domain from Project Gutenberg, I spent a good chunk of time reading poem after poem, until getting to "The Block City," and its magic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, I had set aside some essays by R.L.S., under the title, "Essays in the Art of Writing," and moved from the poems to the essays, the first one being just how he came up with and wrote "Treasure Island," originally titled, "The Sea Cook." Turns out the spark came from a map he drew, and the entire family contributed to the novel, since he read much of it to them and worked with their suggestions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, he was a genius, completing the book in a matter of a few weeks, literally writing a chapter day, with a short interval during which he walked a lot, before wrapping things up. The essay is called "My First Book: 'Treasure Island.'"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For budding writers, it might make sense to sit down with the essay for some insights. The essay can be found on the Project Gutenberg website, along with R.L.S.'s other works. In the same collection, "Essays in the Art of Writing," I highly recommend, "On Some Technical Elements of Style in Literature."  </p>

<p>And on to the recommended listening. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First the podcasts, which includes another one featuring Yuval Noah Harari, from the Gray Area podcast, called "Yuval Noah Harari on the eclipsing of human intelligence." Harari's grasp of the big picture right down to the smallest details is amazing. His ability to communicate, clearly, just how A.I. functions and what the effects might be, are always tempered with a sound understanding of human nature.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second of the podcasts features a novelist, who has thought long and hard about human nature and the effects of technology. Zadie Smith, the British novelists, appears on the Ezra Klein Show, in the episode called "Zadie Smith on Populists, Frauds and Flip Phones." Her insight into artificial intelligence and technology comes along fairly well into the conversation, by which time a listener may just begin to grasp her fine intellect and genuine humanity.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Netflix documentaries are "What's Next? The Future with Bill Gate" and "The Future Of" respectively.</p>

<p>Consider becoming a supporting member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
