<p>He finally got his call to the Major Leagues. John T. Reardon, Jr., of Bristol entered the Field of Dreams on July 10, surrounded by family after a lengthy illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Known for his Irish twinkle, booming voice and generous heart, he was always thinking “outside of the box.” He will be missed by many, but no one as much as his wife, Josie, who welcomed all those he brought home to the family dinner table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John was born in Hartford, the son of the late John T. and Mildred (Barry) Reardon, Sr. He was predeceased by his sister, Maureen Hennessy.</p>

<p>John always loved his baseball. In both life and on the field, he preferred to pitch. Living on the Yankees, Red Sox nation border, he always stood out from the crowd wearing his bright green Oakland A’s jacket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was a standout athlete graduating from Bristol High School in 1959. Not yet ready for the Majors, he pursued his passion for play at Springfield College earning a degree in physical education and history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was better than a perfect pitch when he first set eyes on Josie (Russo), the woman he referred to as “my beautiful bride” for the next 57 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John followed his father’s footsteps to the Bristol school system where he taught history and served as administrator in both of the city’s high schools, Edgewood and Mountain View elementary schools. He was an educational pioneer using long distance phone lines of 1960s to bring national news headliners into the classroom with his “tele-lecture” program wherein students could converse with politicians, activists and sports stars over speakerphone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He always gave 110 percent -- whether to help a child in school or to right a wrong. John created a second career following his retirement from the Bristol schools, authoring “All Star Dads” and “Diamonds will Sparkle.” He lectured nationally inspiring parents and supporting young fathers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He still played ball. Fastpitch softball was his game. He played for decades; at times rotating four different uniforms in one season.&nbsp;A highlight of his career was the night he broke Cy Young’s record exceeding his 511 lifetime wins as a pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When not playing, he spent a good deal of time exploring the diversity of this world and its many peoples. He invited international diplomats from the United Nations into his home “to see a real American family” initiating many unlikely but lifelong friendships. He and Josie traveled extensively, meeting and making friends in each of the fifty countries they explored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was home.&nbsp;He lived and served this community with energy and positivity. Through his career and volunteer work, he touched countless lives striving to always “Make a difference.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John’s faith and family rooted his energy. He was one of the original parishioners of St. Gregory the Great, and once served as Eucharistic minister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John's greatest joy was his three children and their families.&nbsp;All have memories of spontaneous adventures and escapades to “ecalpon” with no set destination resulting in exploration, discoveries and joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to his beloved wife, Josie, he is survived by his daughters Susan (Erik Matthews) and Julie (Mark Conway) and his son John (Andra) Reardon and his six cherished grandchildren: Alex, Ella, Sean, Ian, Cora and Lea.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family would like to publicly thank those who supported John to be at home his final months including his caregivers, Bristol Hospice and dear friend Kevin Fuller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
