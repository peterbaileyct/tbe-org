<p>The Main Street Community Foundation received $1.5 million in contributions in 2022 and established 13 new funds, it was announced at the organization's annual meeting on March 10, according to a press release.</p>

<p>This past year the Foundation distributed a record $2.3 million in grants and scholarships to benefit the residents of Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington and Wolcott through programs and community leadership initiatives, with a total of $26 million being awarded since the establishment of the Foundation since 1995.  </p>

<p>Among those receiving grantees for the first time were Veterans Strong Community Center, a resource and information center for Veterans in the Greater Bristol area, and St. Vincent De Paul Mission of Bristol, an emergency shelter for men, women, and children in Bristol.</p>

<p>Representatives from both organizations addressed the impact MSCF has made on the work that they do. Veterans Strong's Donna Dognin and Amy Wernicki presented Susan Sadecki, president and CEO of MSCF, and Scott Fournier, board chair, with a commemorative dog tag and a certificate of appreciation acknowledging the Foundation as an “outstanding patriot partner.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
