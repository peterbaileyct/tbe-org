<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol boys lacrosse coop has continued to make gains throughout the 2023 campaign, making a little history along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combined efforts from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern, under the guidance of coach Eric Bell - who was here, there and everywhere this past spring - helped the program establish a new record for wins in a season with 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 14-win mark tied Fairfield Prep for the most victories by a Class L program this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Kingstreeters and Prep went 14-2 in regular season battles this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And give the squad credit because the only teams that were able to hang regular season losses against Bristol were Lewis Mills (9-8 on April 17) and Wethersfield (18-0 on April 24).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, the squad defeated everything in its path.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason was a bit trickier, however.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Bristol team qualified for the CCC Tournament, dropping a tough 11-4 decision to Mills and then fell to No. 10 Fairfield Ludlowe 20-3 in the CIAC Class L’s qualifying round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at 14-4, who can complain about the final results by the coop program?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off that outstanding campaign, three players from the Bristol program earned All-Conference honors from the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore, junior and seniors classes were represented on the All-Conference squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Ian Reardon, junior Dylan Brown and senior Jakub Warszawik all earned postseason honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warszawik, a senior defender, usually was in the top one or two in ground balls and helped senior keeper Max Stavens keep the opposing offenses in check.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was certainly one of the top defenders in all of the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of ground balls, Brown typically led the team in that category (he had 11 alone in the 14-6 victory over Enfield on April 20) and also put in the work offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown could be good for a couple goals a game and every team needs a multi-talented athlete like Brown running up and down the turf with supreme effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reardon was another offensive star for the program, one of the leaders in goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually scoring a couple goals every match, he scored three goals in the 16-3 victory over Windsor back on April 27 and usually garnered a couple ground balls every match. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three athletes deserved the in-season accolades and expect more of the same from Brown and Reardon as Bristol lacrosse continues to improve and grow as a sport next year.</p>
