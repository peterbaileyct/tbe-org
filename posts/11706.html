<p>“I think the team went above and beyond, everyone was there for everyone no matter what.&nbsp; As for me, being my last season I would never thought it would come, I never thought four years would fly by so fast.&nbsp; I am so glad everyone, made it a meet I will never forget from team mates to coaches to other swimmers on other teams.&nbsp; I just want to say thank you to everyone for an awesome four years!” Senior Captain Mikel Palaj said.</p>

<p>Senior Nathan Stellmach took that energy he generated during the Medley Relay record setting to win the 50 free, claim the CCC South meet record in the 100 breast and once again help his team set the records in the 400 free relay.&nbsp; Nathan’s seed time in the 100 breast was faster than the previous record, so it was just a matter of time to see if he would capture the crown.&nbsp; And he did!&nbsp; “Our performance, really showed the outcome of lots of hard work and dedication.&nbsp; Everyone on the team came into the season with a purpose and a plan.&nbsp; Along with genuine support for one another, we were all able to perform our best and break records.&nbsp; It was a great way for the seniors to leave their mark.&nbsp; I want to thank everyone for making my transition into yet another swim program welcoming and incredibly easy,” Captain Nathan Stellmach said.</p>
