<p>An annual event until COVID struck, "The Holiday Showcase of Stars" returns to the stage at St. Paul Catholic High School this Saturday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>"We wanted to present a show that represented the resiliency of the human spirit, the need to get back out into the world, and a resurgence of not only that spirit, but also our faith and our hope," said Deb Schur, one of the event planners and directors.</p>

<p>The show, entitled "All Is Well," features 21 local acts, including soloists, duets, group numbers and dance routines. The cast and crew are offering the production in memory of the late Bristol police officers, Lt. Dustin DeMonte and Sgt. Alex Hamzy and in honor of Officer Alec Iurato. A special dance will be offered in their honor.</p>

<p>The organizers tried to put on a show in 2020, hoping that the COVID pandemic would have subsided by then, Schur said, but that did not happen.</p>

<p>"In 2021, we had more hope and started creating and planning but then with the upsurge we once again put everything on hold," she said.</p>

<p>With this year's show, the group's 17th and first since 2019, Schur added: "We felt an even greater need to gather as a community, in love, faith and unity."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our hope is that one day 'All Is Well' might someday be more than just the title of the show," Schur said.   </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
