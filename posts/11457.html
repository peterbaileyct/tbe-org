<p>A lifelong resident, he attended Bristol High School. He loved his hometown of Bristol and its good people. He worked as a stone mason with his father in his youth and many examples of his workmanship such as the Sherman Park development entrance walls remain to this day. He was widely known by many for the family grocery business, Ferarro’s Foods. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many a Bristol youth had their first job at Joe’s store where they were taught to work hard and act in kindness to others. Joe took great pride in providing his beloved customers with fine food selections at very affordable prices. In 1974, he led a national meat boycott to address runaway prices by large distributors. &nbsp;</p>

<p>He was a friend to then Gov. Ella Grasso and many civic leaders. Joe was known as a very giving person who was always willing to help his customers, local churches, and charities. In retirement, he continued to live selflessly always quietly helping others in need. His deep abiding faith in his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was his guiding light. He was loved by many and especially loved by his family. &nbsp;</p>
