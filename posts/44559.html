<p>Naugatuck scored its first two runs in the top of the first inning. With one out, Kevin Cestari hit a routine fly ball to right field that was dropped. That extended the inning and allowed first baseman Alexander Teixeira to bat with two outs. Teixeira hit the first pitch that he saw over the center field fence to give Naugatuck the early 2-0 lead.</p>

<p>In the top of the second, James Crilly led off with a single to center. After the next two batters were retired, back-to-back infield singles by Damon Abate and Cestari loaded the bases. Dylan Sepulveda's routine grounder was booted, and Naugatuck had its third run. Then Teixeira hit into a fielder's choice where no out was recorded, and Naugatuck led 4-0.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
