<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern girls tennis teams held their annual city series battle on Friday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Rams tallied up a 6-1 victory over the Lancers from the tennis courts at Bristol Central High School, Eastern showed grit throughout competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s top singles player, Brooke Treannie, was able to snare a win in her match but Central swept through the rest of line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the home team rolled through doubles play with a 3-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Treannie was able to top Alex Rivera by scores of 7-5 and 6-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At No. 2 singles, Central’s Sam Chapman defeated Adrianna Reay (6-3, 6-3) and at No. 3, the Rams Ava McCann swept Vanessa Cyr 6-0 over set one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In set two, Cyr pushed McCann to the brink but the athlete from Central held on to win, 7-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the fourth singles match, Central’s Emely Sosa Requena and Eastern’s Trish Mohan went the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mohan roped up the first set, 6-2, but Sosa Requena bounced back in set two for a 6-3 victory - forcing an overtime situation as the match was all tied up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Sosa Requena rolled out a 10-4 third set victory to snare the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doubles play, Central’s top duo of Alexa and Brooke Rinaldi roped up wins of 6-2 and 6-0 against Eastern’s Olivia Dossias and Ava Gesner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number two doubles combo of Liz Martin and Hannah Krueger spun Eastern’s Maria Perrone and Kiana Ouellette (6-2, 6-2) and at No. 3, the Rams saw the team of Sydney LaRosa and Angella Avila defeat the Lancers Sam Rivard and Taylor Berube (6-1, 6-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved to 9-4 over the winning effort while the Lancers fell to 1-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams complete their regular season on Tuesday with a home match against Berlin (3:45 p.m.) while on Wednesday, the Lancers travel to Wickham Park to battle East Catholic - also at 3:45 p.m.</p>
