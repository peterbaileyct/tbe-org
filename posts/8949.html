<p><br><br>As your city councilwoman representing the 3rd district, I'm seeking re-election to continue the progress started by our Democratic team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my professional life, I am tasked with developing solutions that help our members. I look at data, form a hypothesis, learn from our customers, and create a solution that makes a positive impact. I believe these skills have already shown their value over my past 2 years in office. I ask questions during our meetings, I talk to our citizens about their concerns, and I solve their problems. I work with my council team and our city department heads to think of creative ways to make Bristol better.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am also a mother. This also influences my leadership style. I think of other families in Bristol and how our decisions can improve their quality of life. I do this by supporting quality of life projects like the renovation of Page Park pool, the master plan for our parks, approving Parks Ambassadors to keep parks safe, and supporting the work of the Arts &amp; Culture commission.</p>

<h3><strong>Questio</strong>ns and Answers</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you have done well that justifies your reelection? What are you specifically going to do to ensure that&nbsp;&nbsp;progress continues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I believe that one of the biggest values I bring to the council, is my inquisitive nature. During our meetings I ask questions and am always looking to deepen my understanding and share my perspective.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I also work to make our government more inclusive, by sharing important information in my public social media profiles and clarifying how the public can gain more information about the topics we are discussing during meetings.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><br>I believe that making our meetings and government in general more open and collaborative pushes progress forward, because the more that people know about the work that we are doing, the more support it receives. Misinformation and information lacking context can stop progress, it’s critical that we ensure folks know what’s going on at city hall, so that they can be involved and a part of the progress we are working towards.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What work have you done to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there more that needs to be done?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I believe our council has worked as a team to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol in a multitude of ways. Our Mayor established the first ever Diversity Council, who I have supported through attending events and more. I have also supported the nomination of diverse faces to serve on our public boards, something I am very proud to support.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In addition, I have advocated for increasing awareness of our hiring opportunities within the fire department to expand the universe of candidates we would typically reach. I think we have more work to do in this area and will be exploring ways to continue ensuring equity and inclusion on our government.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are taxes in Bristol too high or fair as they are? If you think taxes are too high, what specific cuts would you recommend to bring them down and how would you deal with the impact on services and programs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I believe that as a city, we receive excellent services for the taxes we pay, I do believe they are fair. I of course believe too, that we always should be working to ensure that taxes do not increase drastically and that our government is operating as efficiently as possible. I believe our team has been doing that, by making fiscally sound decisions.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We have heard concerns over crime recently, which I know resonates with us all. Although these issues are not specific to Bristol and may seem disconnected from taxes, I believe the way that our tax dollars are spent directly correlates to our quality of life. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To ensure we are tackling crime in our community for instance, we use our taxes to fund important city services like our police force to patrol, schools to educate our kids, parks for safe places to gather, our first responders, our public works departments who ensure we have working streetlights, our libraries who provide educational opportunities and the arts to engage our youth.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Quality services form the cornerstone of the Bristol that we love, and I will always work to ensure that the services we have in Bristol remain top quality, while responsibly managing taxes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am a lifelong Bristol resident. &nbsp;I graduated from Boston College with a degree in History and Secondary Education.

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you have done well that justifies your reelection? What are you specifically going to do to ensure that&nbsp;&nbsp;progress continues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No one project or vote&nbsp;is&nbsp;anything I could point to, to&nbsp;justify my re-election. &nbsp;All&nbsp;the boards and commissions, mostly made up of citizen volunteers, contribute pieces to the puzzle that creates the picture of our city government. &nbsp;Our department heads and staff carry out the projects and provide the service to our residents. &nbsp;I do my best to be prepared for meetings, ask questions, listen, take advantage of opportunities&nbsp;and&nbsp;plan for the future,&nbsp;which I will continue to do. &nbsp;I believe that government can be a force for good and a catalyst for progress and I hope to be a part of that for Bristol.</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Mayor’s&nbsp;leadership has improved diversity, equity and inclusion in Bristol. &nbsp;She created a Diversity Council to address issues facing the city. &nbsp;She has encouraged outreach to diverse populations in our recruitment of employees. &nbsp;And,&nbsp;she has increased the numbers of persons serving&nbsp;our citizen boards and commissions from&nbsp;4 people of color to 40 people of color currently. &nbsp;While I don’t serve on the Diversity Council and I don’t hire employees, I do serve as the&nbsp;liaison&nbsp;to the Commission for Persons with Disabilities. &nbsp;Both my siblings are disabled,&nbsp;and I hope my advocacy there a&nbsp;has played&nbsp;a part in improving diversity, equity and inclusion in Bristol. &nbsp;There is always more work to be done.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Essentially, the Comptroller’s office, the&nbsp;Mayor, the department heads and the Board of Finance work on the budget for months prior to bringing it to a vote. &nbsp;While I only get a vote at the end of the process, I have supported the budgets as presented. &nbsp;Watching the process, I know all involved consider it their duty to be fair, provide the best most efficient service possible, invest in our buildings and infrastructure and maintain financial stability of the city. &nbsp;While individuals may think taxes are too high, I know the process is as fair as it can be.</strong></p>

<p><strong>My husband Wayne and I moved to Bristol in 1992 shortly after our marriage. &nbsp;We chose a home in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Forestville&nbsp;neighborhood. &nbsp;Deciding factors included&nbsp;value, a wonderful community school and ease to highways for work commuting. &nbsp;We&nbsp;went on to raise&nbsp;two successful, loving children&nbsp;in our home. &nbsp;We treasure the friends and connections we have made in Bristol and have room for more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I will bring a strong balance of financial and operational management coming from&nbsp;my professional&nbsp;experience.&nbsp;My talents include the ability&nbsp;to plan, innovate, implement and lead. &nbsp;But some of my strongest gifts are the ability to listen, advocate, fight, problem solve and serve others. &nbsp;I have never been one to go along with the crowd just to avoid doing the right thing. &nbsp;I promise to be ethical, approachable and kind.</strong></p>

<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. You are arguing that things need to change. What specifically would you like to change and how are you going to change it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>One obvious change needs to be open communication with residents about issues and advocating on their behalf. &nbsp;That is why we are elected, to serve them. &nbsp; &nbsp;Two key issues that were prominent this year are the zoning change request on Redstone Hill and the Covanta Medical Waste permit application. &nbsp;People feel they are not heard, decisions&nbsp;were&nbsp;made without their consideration and when they did&nbsp;reach out; they&nbsp;were&nbsp;rebuffed.&nbsp;I will hold regular office hours to listen to your concerns and keep you informed as to what is happening in our city. &nbsp;In addition I will hold quarterly meet and greet sessions at local restaurants to listen to your concerns and highlight our local businesses.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. What would you do specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To improve diversity and inclusion, one must lead by example. &nbsp;How we look at others, how we treat others, how we respect others comes from our heart. &nbsp; With all the division in this world, we need to focus on what we have in common as opposed to why we are different. &nbsp;My experience in bringing together&nbsp;ethnicity, gender, age, race, religion, disability and sexual orientation&nbsp;with success in the work force has prepared me for the challenge before us. &nbsp; </strong><br></p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are taxes in Bristol too high or fair as they are? If you think taxes are too high, what specific cuts would you recommend to bring them down and how would you deal with the impact on services and programs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>&nbsp;Government needs to live within its means. &nbsp; I am a proponent of smaller government, and with smaller government come less expenses. &nbsp;Let’s look at processes and see how we can innovate. &nbsp;In my prior job, I was also managing food services; through changing the shift schedule, bidding out the food supply vendor, by changing the menus and prep work; not only did we save over $50k in the first year&nbsp;we also&nbsp;improved morale and quality. &nbsp;I have had school employees tell me of significant waste, why is this happening? &nbsp;True efficiencies mean expenses go down; with the current administration it is simply talk, no proof.</strong></p>
