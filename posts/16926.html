<h2>Bristol resident wins New Yorker cartoon captioning contest</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a nice surprise to open to the page opposite the back inside cover of the Sept. 12 issue of The New Yorker to see that this week's winning caption was submitted by Edgar Grove, Bristol, Conn. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Victoria Roberts' cartoon depicts a man in a business suit, with tie and jacket and briefcase, holding a tin can to his left ear. A string from the tin can, one of those old telephone contraptions, unwinds over miles and miles of empty hills with no end in sight and no one at the opposite end of the call. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The caption reads: "I haven't heard from you since we were kids!"</p>

<h2>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
