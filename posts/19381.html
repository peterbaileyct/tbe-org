<p>The Bristol Board of Education voted Wednesday to retain Dr. Catherine Carbone for another year as Superintendent of Bristol Public Schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carbone retained her job by a 6-3 vote with board members Russell&nbsp;Anderson, Kristen&nbsp;Giantonio,<strong> </strong>and Todd Sturgeon voting no. It took over an hour in executive session for board members to reach their decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Carbone has faced several obstacles during her tenure. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In December of 2021, the Board voted to revoke her Emergency and Disaster Preparedness emergency powers in a controversial 5-3 vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in March of 2022, a Facebook group “Bristol Parents Group--Unmask our Kids” tried to oust her with a no confidence petition because they did not have belief in her abilities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carbone was named superintendent in January 2019, following the retirement of Sue Moreau. Prior to becoming superintendent, she was a senior administrator in the Hartford schools and spent seven years as principal of Bristol’s Chippen’s Hill Middle school. She also taught science in East Hartford and went on to become an assistant principal.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
