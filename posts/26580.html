<p>​This&nbsp;week, the Jewish community&nbsp;will&nbsp;celebrate the holiday of Shavuot.&nbsp;Shavuot&nbsp;is also referred to as the “Feast of Weeks,” as&nbsp;the Hebrew word&nbsp;<em>S</em><em>havuot</em>&nbsp;literally means “weeks.”&nbsp;It&nbsp;takes place seven weeks from the second Passover seder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another name for Shavuot is the Greek word “Pentecost,” which means 50<sup>th</sup>, as&nbsp;Shavuot begins 50 days after the first seder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>On this holiday, we&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;both the summer harvest and&nbsp;the receiving of the Torah and Ten Commandments at Mt.&nbsp;Sinai.&nbsp;In ancient times,&nbsp;we would celebrate this holiday by bringing offerings of first fruits of&nbsp;the&nbsp;harvest. In observance of Shavuot today, we read from the Book of Ruth.&nbsp;The reason for this is because the Book of Ruth takes place&nbsp;around the same time of year (during the barley harvest)&nbsp;and because Ruth’s&nbsp;accepting&nbsp;Naomi’s religion (Judaism) as her own reminds us of the Israelites accepting the Torah at Mount Sinai.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​When we celebrate Shavuot, we celebrate&nbsp;the Torah.&nbsp;The Torah is essential to Judaism.&nbsp;It provides us with&nbsp;laws and stories&nbsp;to help&nbsp;guide our lives.&nbsp;The Hebrew word&nbsp;<em>Torah&nbsp;</em>literally means “instruction.” It is an instruction book for life.&nbsp;Just as the Torah takes care of our spiritual needs, we are obligated to take care of the Torah as well.&nbsp;Right now, one of our Torahs at Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregtion is in need of some repairs.&nbsp;If you are interested in donating to help repair our Torah, please&nbsp;send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rabbi@gsjc.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rabbi@gsjc.org</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;more information.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
