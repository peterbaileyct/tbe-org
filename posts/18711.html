<h3>This date 1959 in Bristol</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a special city council meeting, the council voted to accept the low bid of $16,456 submitted by Commercial Builder Inc. Inc for the construction of a new dog pound on Lake Avenue, adjacent to the Public Works Building. Having been declared unfit for use, the old dog pound on Middle Street was slated to be destroyed.</p>

<h3>This date 1975 World Series</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of the most memorable games in World Series history, Carlton Fisk homers in the bottom of the 12th to propel the Red Sox over the Cincinnati Reds 7-6 in Game 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Sox went on to win that World Series 3 games to 4. Yes, it is the new math. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Advice from Screwy Louie</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday, during his appointed rounds, Bristol’s own Screwy Louie stopped by the TBE offices and offered this piece of advice:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have one simple rule that everyone should follow: Always give 100 percent even if you are donating blood.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks, Screwy.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
