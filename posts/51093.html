<p>Five members of the Friends of the Hoppers-Birge Pond Preserve joined the president of the Connecticut chapter of the American Chestnut Foundation in a chestnut harvest at the Hoppers-Birge Pond Preserve as well as other locations in Bristol this past Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>"We collected half a grocery bag full of fertile chestnuts in the morning and then Jack went to several other places in Bristol and collected more," said Friends president Michelle Rudy in an email. "It was a very successful day."</p>

<p>Rudy added that the harvesting in the preserve took place at the end of the Red Trail, dubbed the "Indian Trail," and that the spines on the nutmegs are numerous and sharp, requiring thick gloves.</p>

<p>Another interesting detail that she provided is that the nutmeg pickers are made out of Arizona Iced Tea containers, cut open at the bottom, on top of a 15-feet long telescoping pole.</p>

<p>Jan Gatzuras, volunteering for the first time, said in an email, "I'm always exited, happy and energized to help out our natural world.  It gives us so much and desperately needs our help.  In addition, it feels great to be with others who feel the same way."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experience was about what she expected, Gatzuras said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The American chestnut trees in the Hoppers are just one of many reasons the Hoppers are so special and deserve our protection," she added, pointing out that "there are so many opportunities to help nature."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, she listed area groups that need volunteers, such as the Pequabuck River Watershed Association with its annual clean up event, the planting of native pollinators as well as resisting the use of chemicals on lawns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I could go on," she said.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
