<p>BRISTOL - After dropping a tough 7-6 decision to Lewis Mills on Saturday, the Bristol Eastern softball squad turned around to pick off a very good Tolland squad by a 6-3 push Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers moved to 10-8 overall on the campaign, winning their fifth contest in six tries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles fell to 12-4 overall, winning eight of nine coming into the showdown in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol led 6-0 through five innings of work and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin was busy on both sides of the plate for the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the pitching front, the senior threw seven strong innings - earning a complete game victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She allowed six hits, three earned runs, walked only one and struck out seven over a complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the time the Eagles generated any momentum in the showdown, the squad was too far behind on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin went 1-for-3 with a two-RBI single while Emily Valentine smacked out a two-RBI double to pace the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makayla Antunes also added a hit while Gracie Browne added one as Eastern made all four of its hits count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Brown scored two runs, as did Valentine, while Gracie Browne and Madi Charette also tallied a run apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Sarah Lacouture - the senior behind the dish - made a team-leading seven putouts while Gracie Browne added five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory put Eastern around the 21st position in the current Class L playoff field (Bristol Central is second at 17-1) as only two games remain on the docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a back-to-back challenge, Conard comes to Bristol on Wednesday (4 p.m.) while Central and Eastern tangle on Thursday (4:15 p.m.) from the softball field at BCHS.</p>
