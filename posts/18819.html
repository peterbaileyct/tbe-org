<p>EASTON, MA – There was little doubt that former Bristol Eastern soccer star Jake Woznicki was going to be extremely successful at the collegiate level. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a record-setting career for the boys program on King Street, he’s continued to blast in goals against some talented teams. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior competitor has seemingly done it all for the men's soccer program at Stonehill College – a school that recently moved up to the NCAA Division I level. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the former Lancers’ standout helped the program to its first NCAA Division I victory back on September 10 as the Skyhawks zipped up a 1-0 win over the University of Saint Thomas from Minnesota. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big win for the program as Woznicki tallied the game-winning goal at the 78-minute mark of the match – propelling Stonehill to that huge D-I triumph. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s already been a busy year for the junior standout because before that first victory, Woznicki was named a Northeast Conference Prime Performers of the Week over the final days of August.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forward notched his first two-goal performance over a tough 5-3 loss at La Salle back on August 26. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And not surprisingly, the likeable Woznicki has continued to keep his foot on the gas offensively. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Stonehill’s first 13 matches this season, Woznicki led the squad in goals scored (seven) and shots attempted on goal (20). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s started every match for the men’s program, tallying two of the squad’s three game-winning goals. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His game winners came against the University of Saint Thomas on September 10 and at the University of Hartford exactly one week later. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Woznicki scored two goals over those two matches to lead the Skyhawks. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The previous season as a sophomore, Woznicki started 13 of 17 matches, notching three goals and dishing out two assists – good for eight points. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His three goals put him second on the squad while scooping up two game-winning goals along the way. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woznicki scored his first goal against Felician College back on September 15, 2021, playing well for the Division I program. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about his work in the classroom as well. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned a spot on the NE10 Academic Honor Roll that fall and is another excellent student-athlete from the Mum City. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woznicki is a 2020 Eastern graduate and earned CCC South All-Conference in soccer in all four years of scholastic play under the tutelage of long-time mentors Bill Sweet and Bunty Ray.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the way, he was selected to the All-State team in his final two seasons of play for the Lancers. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned All-American honors as a senior over a record-breaking campaign at BEHS.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a senior standout, he established a new school scoring record as he kicked in 39 goals – nabbing 72 overall for his career. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The old record was held by Chris Ghiglia (63 goals). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a senior in 2019, the Kingstreeters did not lose a regular season game as Eastern went 14-0-2 which included a nine-game winning streak and a huge 3-2 overtime victory against Bristol Central on November 4. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were the top seed in the Class L bracket that season, losing to Guilford in the quarterfinal round over the final seconds of the match in a 1-0 loss. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters went 15-1-2 overall before Woznicki headed off to Stonehill to continue his playing career.   </p>
