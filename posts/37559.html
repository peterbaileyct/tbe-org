<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Thanksgiving Day records from the historic Battle for the Bell, pitting the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern football programs against one another, are a tremendous read and a deep look into our scholastic history in town. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several records between the schools that are tremendous in scope while other standards aren’t as impressive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, over the years, a lot of those early records have fallen by the wayside as numerous all-city athletes have taken Muzzy Field by storm.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some of those records have still stood the test of time to this very day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a stroll down memory lane and look at some individual Thanksgiving Day records between Central and Eastern: &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Game Day Records: Individual&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most touchdowns – 5, Tim Washington (Bristol Central), 2000 &amp; Victor Rosa (Bristol Central), 2019&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Washington made scoring runs of 40, 2, 4, 11 and 69 yards in the victory over Eastern. He ended the season tied for the state record in touchdowns scored in a single season with 42. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Rosa matched that feat in 2019 in the overtime victory over the Lancers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most yards rushing – 353 yards, Tim Washington (Bristol Central), 2000&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Washington ended the year with 3,005 yards, a state record.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most yards passing – 308 yards, Dennis Schermerhorn (Bristol Eastern), 1970&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*That season, the Central Connecticut State University bound Schermerhorn threw for over 1,700 yards for Eastern. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most pass receptions – 8, Rick Schmaltz (Bristol Eastern), 1970 &amp; Elijah Gagliardo (Bristol Eastern), 2017&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Schmaltz gathered up 161 yards on those eight catches and scored a touchdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Gagliardo matched that same feat 47 years later. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most receiving yards – 161 yards, Rick Schmaltz (Bristol Eastern), 1970&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Once again, Schmaltz caught eight receptions for 161 yards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most TD passes – 3, Dennis Schermerhorn (Bristol Eastern), 1969 and 1970&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Eastern won those games by a combined 59-28 score, seizing the win over back-to-back campaigns. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest run from scrimmage – 87 yards, Gregg Vontell (Bristol Central), 1982&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>The halfback made his historic rush in the second quarter; Vontell scored three times that day over runs of 87, 80 and 24 yards. Overall, he scooped up 235 yards on 20 carries for a big day.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest pass completion – 82 yards, Kiernan Thurston (Bristol Central) and 82 yards, John Laviero both from Marvin Fitzpatrick, 1988&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Central QB Marvin Fitzpatrick found both John Laviero and Kiernan Thurston for 82-yard receptions. That’s a crazy day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest fumble return – 70 yards, Edgar Hernandez (Bristol Eastern), 2016&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Hernandez broke the old record held by Eastern’s Reinaldo Soto from 1996. He returned a fumble recovery for 65 yards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest kick return – 95 yards, Garry Pearson (Bristol Central), 1977&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central won the game 24-21 as Pearson, the former Bristol Eastern standout, accounted for 230 yards on the ground for the Rams on 36 carries.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest punt return – 64 yards, Ron Davis (Bristol Central), 2000&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Eastern’s Mel Davis dropped in a tremendous 40-yard punt, but Ronny Davis ran it in for a touchdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest return of interception – 95 yards, Jere Merriam (Bristol Central), 1984&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Merriam nabbed a pass by Eastern’s Julio Maisonet and ran it in for the game’s third score of the day. From 1975 through 1984, Central went undefeated against Eastern on T-Day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Best pass percentage – 87.5 percent, Mike Hannon (Bristol Eastern), 1964&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Hannon connected on 7-of-8 passes for 87 yards in the 21-0 victory over Central. It was the Lancers second ever victory over the Rams. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most pass completions – 20, Matt Coyne (Bristol Central), 2007&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Coyne tossed 38 attempts that day but the Rams still lost, 42-14 – a score that was predicted on the money by then Bristol Press correspondent Michael Letendre (as I’ve said before, that guy has been around…). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most carries – 43 rushes, Jeff Castolene (Bristol Central), 1971&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Castolene zipped in 153 yards and four TDs to help the Rams secure the victory. He had 1,223 yards on the year to go along with 10 touchdowns. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest punt – 60 yards, Gene Mitchell (Bristol Central), 1981&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>For the day, the Rams averaged 44 yards-per-punt in the 13-8 win over Eastern &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Best punt average – 4-for-50, Dave Cichon (Bristol Eastern), 1965</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most extra points – 6 PATs, Chris Hazelton (Bristol Eastern), 2007&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The future Southern Connecticut University kicker went 6-for-6 on the day for the Lancers. In 2011, Hazelton kicked in 10-of-14 field goals for Southern Connecticut State University football program – tied for second all-time in program history. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most field goals – 1, Bill Woods (Bristol Eastern), 1996, Jeremy Meccariello (Bristol Eastern), 2012&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>The Woods field goal was a 22 yard make, the first in Turkey Day history, while Meccariello’s boot was a 25-yard shot – the longest on Thanksgiving. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest field goal – 25, Jeremy Meccariello (Bristol Eastern), 2012&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>See above. The kicker managed to go 3-for-4 on attempts the following year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most interceptions – 3, Gordon Sargent (Bristol Eastern), 1963&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Fun fact: Sargent also ran in a 79-yard kickoff return for a score as Eastern won by a 16-0 tally – the program’s first ever victory on Thanksgiving. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Day, Single Game Records:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
