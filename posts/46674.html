<p>After 99-years of wear on his legs, it is with some relief that Navy World War II veteran Dick Fitz cranks up his new riding mower. He not only cuts his lawn but he cuts the lawns of his neighbors and even drives over for a visit, up and down Sunnydale Avenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitz had quite a career with the Navy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During WWII he was a gunner on a Merchant Marine ship that ran a course in which 79 ships were lost to German U-boats, taking 3,000 sailors with them.</p>

<p>The run was to supply Russia.&nbsp;While on this run his ship was hit by a German torpedo that turned out to be a dud. A picture the damaged ship sitting in dry dock for repair is displayed in his home.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the war, Fitz spent five days in London during the intense bombing by the Germans. He hid at night in their subway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also on his travels, he passed through both canals, Panama and Suez, and was on the Mariana Islands when both atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan arrived and were loaded on the planes that delivered them. He has a picture of the hole dug to enable the bombs to be loaded.</p>

<p>The riding mover arrived at his home on the morning of May 29 on a flatbed truck from UNITED Ag &amp; Turf, which included a bonus check for a third of the price of the mower among other gifts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there is a problem with the arrival of the mower, it is that Fitz's grandsons and great grandsons want to drive it.</p>

<p>Fitz is a longtime member of American Legion, Post 2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
