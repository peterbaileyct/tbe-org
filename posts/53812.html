<p>The water on Riverside Avenue will be shut off for water main work related to the Bridge Project beginning today, Tuesday, Nov. 12, from 9 p.m. until tomorrow morning at 3 a.m., according to an emergency construction from the Sewer and Water Department.<br>     <br>Aside from residences and businesses on Riverside Avenue between Mellon Street and Memorial Boulevard, surrounding areas may also experience a period of low water pressure.  When the water is turned back, it may be discolored. If this happens, the department advises running an outside faucet or cold water, only, in a bathtub until the water clears.<br> <br>A water filling station is located at the Water Filtration Plant and is available 24/7 to any customers who are affected by an extended service interruption.</p>

<p>There is no charge to customers affected by the water service interruption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Customers will need to bring their own containers and Filtration Plant Operators will assist in filling them.</p>

<p>The Water Filtration Plant is located at 1080 Terryville Avenue and the number to the plant is (860) 583-6504. It would be appreciated if customers could call the plant in advance of arrival.</p>
