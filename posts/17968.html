<p>The RHAM volleyball program is a perennial state power. They won a state championship last year, their eighth since 2002, and they have averaged 20 victories a year since 2002. So the Lancers of Bristol Eastern knew they were in for a battle when the Raptors walked into the Eastern gym on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>But Eastern has a pretty good volleyball heritage of its own, and the Lancers gave RHAM everything they had, but they eventually fell to the Raptors in four sets. The scores were: </p>

<p>Set 1: 18-25, Set 2: 16-25, Set 3: 25-23, and Set 4: 22-25.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM had some big hitters at the net, as Lani Fecho had 20 kills, and Ally Hadley added 19 kills. Both players showed all-around skills, as Hadley also had 15 digs, while Fecho was all over the court with 27 digs.</p>

<p>The Lancers were led by Lauren Bender, who had 20 kills and 12 digs. Emily Valentine chipped in with an ace, a kill, and 14 digs. Gabby Caucci also had a strong night with 3 aces, a kill, 2 blocks, and 7 digs.</p>

<p>RHAM's record is now 10-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fall's to 9-2, but there is a real possibility these two might meet again.</p>

<p>Bristol Eastern travels to AIC College on Monday, 10/10, to take part in the Volleyhall Classic. They then travel to Glastonbury on Wednesday, the 12th.</p>
