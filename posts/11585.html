<p>NEW HAVEN - Both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern wrestling programs were represented at the CIAC State Open over Saturday and Sunday as Connecticut’s best grapplers hit the mats one more time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant Will Hamilton and Alex Marshall were both in action, representing Bristol, from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamilton, the stud from Central, qualified for the third place bout at his usual 120 pounds and made that appearance count as he ramped up a huge decision against Norwalk’s Phoenix Gardella.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a matter of 4:42, Hamilton decimated Gardell to the tune of a 23-7 technical fall as a 15-plus point margin in scholastic wrestling immediately stops the bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That finish allowed the Rams to place 32nd overall behind a 22 point showing.</p>

<p>“One of Coach Q’s favorite sayings is, ‘toughest guy in the bracket places third.’ Will Hamilton - demonstrating physical and mental toughness en route to a third place finish at the CT State Open - embodied this idea this weekend,” said the Bristol Central wrestling account via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the fifth place match at 160 pounds, Eastern’s Marshall fell to Edward Barlage from Guilford over a 4-2 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern notched 11 points overall in the two-day challenge, good for a tie for 48th place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Umar Malick (152 pounds) hung in with eventual runner-up Mason Concascia of Waterford but was pinned in the round of 32 via pin-fall in 1:39.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier of Middletown - the Class L champion - easily won the Open, squaring up nine top-6 finishes for 204 points while Danbury (145 points) was a distant second place finisher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Class L runner-up Simsbury nabbed third place, East Hartford - tying with Danbury for the Class L title - was a half-point behind in fourth while Fairfield Warde (109) rounded out the top five.</p>
