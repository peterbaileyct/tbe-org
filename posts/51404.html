<p>Bristol Eastern (1-4-2) hosted Bristol Central (1-4-3) Monday evening and needed an aggressive run at the end to bring about a 2-2  tie.</p>

<p>The game was even until just before the end of the first half.  Central's Tom Pirog intercepted a Lancer clearance and quickly sent  it across the field to a waiting, unmarked Rafael Antonio, Jr., who deftly sent the ball into the Eastern goal with 4:17 remaining in the period.</p>

<p>"The opening half, and much of the game, was a real battle with players being pressured and  few multiple passing combinations ,” said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "It was a typical Eastern/Central game where emotions ran high and it was difficult to get into a rhythm for either team."</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the second half,&nbsp; Central doubled the score at 14:17 when Renato Teran took a loose ball at the left side of the penalty area and hit a hard shot that deflected off a Lancer defender and into the goal.</p>

<p>The score didn’t stay at 2-0 for very long, as less than a minute later at 13:30,&nbsp; Eastern answered that goal as Lucas Tylicky sent a cross to the back side of the Rams' net and Landon Gawel knocked it home to cut the lead to 2-1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Goalie James Palma made 7 saves for Central while Connor Murtaugh had 6 saves for Eastern.</p>
