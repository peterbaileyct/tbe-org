<p>The Bristol Chorale bake sale fundraiser held outside the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School polling site turned out to be a good day for the Chorale -- and things did not end there.</p>

<p>"We are a community chorus whose members have firmly established Bristol roots," Chorale president Betsey Grady wrote in an email the next day. "It was a no-brainer for Donna (Doucette, fundraising chair) and I to decide what to do with all the items we had left. They were delivered today to Pat Stebbins and her crew at Brian's Angels."</p>

<p>Grady added that Chorale members really stepped up to provide an abundant variety of baked goods, something for everyone, including gluten free options. Next time around, she said, there would be vegan treats.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Word spread throughout the day, she wrote, so that people who didn't even vote at BAIMS came out to support the bake sale.</p>

<p>Grady, Doucette and Doucete's husband, Jim, spent the whole day at BAIMS. They were joined by Chorale members at different times.</p>

<p>"We are both very tired and achy--we are not getting any younger--but it was a very successful fundraising venture for us," Grady wrote.</p>

<p>In the postscript of her email, she announced the Bristol Chorale's next concert will be its Holiday Festival of Joy at Bristol Central High School on Sunday, Dec. 17 at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
