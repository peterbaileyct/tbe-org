<p>Main Street Community Foundation recently announced that they are accepting applications for The Craig Yarde Scholarship Fund from residents of Bristol who are graduating high school seniors, currently enrolled students, or adult learners seeking financial assistance for further post-secondary education or career training goals. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Established in 2022, The Craig Yarde Scholarship Fund honors the memory of Craig Yarde, a well-known<br>community leader and the co-founder of Yarde Metals, Inc., which began in Bristol in 1976. Craig personified entrepreneurial spirit, continual learning and self-achievement, and his family established this scholarship to inspire students who have the same work ethic and passion he displayed throughout his lifetime.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
