<p>The Bristol Bulldog cheerleaders took a first Place for D8 and a second place for D12 last weekend in the State Championships. "We are headed to regionals!”  exclaimed Bulldog Cheer Coach Danielle Cox.</p>

<p>The lady bulldogs competed in the CTYFC State Competition on Sunday, November 6, at Weaver High School. Hundreds of cheerleaders and spectators from across the state attended.</p>

<p> Bristol's younger D8 team started the all-day event with a great performance, but anxiety would soon creep in at the awards presentation after not hearing their name for 3rd or 2nd place. They were absolutely crushed as even coaches tried their hardest to hold back tears knowing it could signal the end of their season, but they were soon elated as they heard the teams name announced for FIRST PLACE! </p>

<p>The afternoon portion of the event was jump started with an energetic performance by the older D12 team who performed with passion and sass- the whole gym was going crazy! The D12 team ended the day with an impressive 2nd place finish. </p>

<p>If the ladies are able to carry the momentum into the regional competition and place within the top 3 then they’ll find themselves traveling to Orlando, Florida in December for the AYC National Championship. </p>
