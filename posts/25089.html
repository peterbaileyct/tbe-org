<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern softball team isn’t exactly playing like a squad that is currently carrying a 1-3 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And like Monday afternoon’s contest from the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden, Maloney trailed early in its battle against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a huge third inning by the home team gave Maloney the lead for good as the squad snared an 11-8 win in a CCC South engagement – moving to 5-1 overall on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, playing their third close game in a row, fell for the third time in four tries this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never gave in from the plate and kept Maloney’s infield and outfield in motion throughout the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Brown led the charge for the Lancers with three hits, including a double and triple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scored three runs and went 3-of-4 overall from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooklynne Whitlock went 2-of-3 with an RBI, Emily Valentine nabbed three hits in four at bats, also tallying both a double and triple while notching three runs, and Makayla Antunes went 2-for-4 with a run and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin also had a day, going 2-of-4, scoring a run and scooping in a team-high three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Georgia Showerda led the offensive charge for the Spartans with three hits, including a double, and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the circle, Hailey Beebe (2 IP, 6 ER, 2 BB) drew a tough loss for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin threw a solid four innings, allowing just five hits, three earned runs and two walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s freshman chucker, Stella Cicero, went the full seven innings and somehow staved off an aggressive Eastern offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She won the game behind an 11-hit effort that included five earned runs, two walks and three strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern notched four runs in the top of the first inning and led 5-3 through two frames of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Maloney put a little pressure on Eastern with a six-run third to snare a 9-5, never to trail again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers grabbed two runs in the fifth and one more in the seventh to close the deficit to three in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern simply never got over the hump as the Spartans squared up a big 11-8 victory to win its fifth straight contest.</p>
