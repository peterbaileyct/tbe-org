<p>Bristol experienced an influx of people who lined up in their cars to get Covid tests at Centre Square in downtown on North Main Street on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a sight-to-behold as cars formed a snake pattern that was never-ending. <br></p>

<p>Drive-thru became a&nbsp;whole&nbsp;new meaning for me although there was was no food waiting for me at the end of the line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had been sick for a few days with what I suspected to be a reaction to the booster shot. I can almost hear the&nbsp;antivaxxers&nbsp;chiming in,&nbsp;“ I told you so.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At it’s peak, my fever spiked to 102&nbsp;f and I can tell you I felt like someone dropped me off in the Mohave desert and left me there for days.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was required to take a covid test so that I can go back to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon arrival at 2:14 p.m., and after some confusion, I finally found the end of the line. It was definitely no stairway to heaven, that’s for sure. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first hour, I entertained myself on Instagram, laughing at all the crazy videos that people post. I often wonder as many of us surely do, “ who thinks of these things?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the second hour, boredom set in so I decided to jump out of my car and take photos. It was a sight-to-behold indeed. <br></p>

<p>People were watching me from their cars because they obviously had nothing else to do either. I became cheap entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evelyn Irrizzard, a 50-year-old New Britain resident, was waiting behind me in line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I arrived at 11:45a.m. because they were opening at 12:00p.m.,” &nbsp;said Irrizzard. “I went back to New&nbsp;Britain to get my laptop and got back at 1:45p.m.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had been patiently waiting with her teenage daughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People were being impatient by blocking the cars trying to cross over to the&nbsp;end of the snake line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By now it was 2 1/2 hours that I had been waiting, patiently, I might add. Although I was dying to go to the bathroom. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The streetlights came on, and I’m still waiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was giving my partner-in-crime, Rit Carter, one of our TBE reporters, a play by play of my surroundings by text messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“24 cars away from the finish line” I texted Carter. I felt like it was a Tortoise race to see who gets to the finish line first.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He texted back. “Go Team.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was now down to&nbsp;ten&nbsp;cars in front of me and Carter texted, “Go Team” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My reply, “two cars in” and I get a “touch down’ response from Carter. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 5:01 I reached the finish line. It only took 2 hours and 56 minutes, but time flies when you’re having fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I now have to wait patiently for two days to get my results.&nbsp;</p>
