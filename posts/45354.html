<p>We are having a tree cut down in the backyard, so we called Tom Engels. Tom came over on Wednesday with Jason Poirier who has been working with him. After the business talk was done, we chatted about the old days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Tom, it was the Revolutionary Monument on Memorial Boulevard -- Tom’s idea for one. Turns out it is in the likeness of Tom in his uniform -- he’s a Revolutionary War reenactor -- and his face was done by a sculpture artist. But it is Tom! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jason was a wrestler in high school, and I had written about him. Good memories of two solid fellows. </p>

<p>George Sobestanovich called here to catch up with me the other day, and we had a nice conversation. George used to stop by the Bristol Press often to visit me. He’s a visitor of sorts to many, those in convalescent homes and what have you. He’s the master of Bristol’s past and loves downtown from the 1950’s</p>

<p><strong>Kory Lane</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a house burnt down on Kory Lane the other day, the area of the old Kory Lake. The lake was named after Tony Korytko who owned the property before it was built up. Tony also owned a meat market in Forestville.</p>

<p><strong>The long and winding road</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had a visiting nurse visit me at home on Friday, a fellow who lived in Forestville Center. He asked me about the old train station, and then the roadway from Brook Street to James P. Casey Road. He thought that it was unusual that the route was made of so many different names, Brook Street, Mix Street, (crossing) Burlington Avenue, Peacedale and James P. Casey Road. So I explained the best I could.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brook crossed a state highway and became Mix Street after an old-time farmer owned that area. You cross Burlington Avenue which takes you to Burlington, Conn., and then go up Peacedale. Peacedale turns into James P. Casy after our five-time mayor who had New Departure placed on the hill.</p>

<p><strong>St. Joseph Cemetery</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my so-called interests and hobbies is taking care of a few cemetery plots at the cemetery. I started 10 years ago when my friend Jimmy Master died. While doing so, I often hear a car or pick-up truck horn blow as they pass by--couldn’t figure out what was taking place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I realized, friends and relatives are saying hello to a loved one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shopay Field</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m always looking to name things after Bristol’ best, in sports or otherwise. So, my topic here is Tom Shopay. Tom played baseball for Stafford School, Bristol Eastern and elsewhere before joining the New York Yankees, and later the Baltimore Orioles. Perhaps we should consider naming a field here in Bristol on his behalf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My first thought is at Stafford School, because the former Forestville league and Bristol Eastern fields are booked already. So, how about Stafford, the grammar school he graduated from in 1959? Food for thought!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
