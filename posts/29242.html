<p>The Annual Community Conversation will return to Rockwell Park on Thursday for the fourth consecutive year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hosted by the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth, and Community Services (BPRYCS), this insightful event aims to raise awareness about mental health and foster an open dialogue within the community.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are very pleased to once again be hosting the Award Winning Community Conversation on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Rockwell Park,” stated BPRYCS Superintendent Dr. Joshua Medeiros.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This year the event is focused on mental health, and we are creating a space for the community to come together to not only hear Wes Woodson’s inspiring story, but also to have the opportunity to learn more about the resources in Bristol to support positive mental health.”</p>

<p>The Fourth Annual Community Conversation on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) will focus on mental health, and will be facilitated by Wes Woodson, a nationally renowned professional public speaker, mental health advocate, and published author. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last three years, Wes has given a TED Talk, published his first book, “I Have Anxiety (So What?)”, and has spoken to thousands of students around the country on the topics of mental health, self-empowerment, and self-love.</p>

<p>The previous year’s Annual Community Conversation was facilitated by Kamora Le’Ella Herrington, who encouraged the crowd to ask one another what a celebration of diversity looks like in their households. Over 100 community members&nbsp;discussed issues of inclusion, diversity and equity while sharing personal experiences throughout the evening.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
