<p>Eva C. Fortier, 83, passed on Sunday, May 21, quietly and peacefully in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The daughter of the late Louis E. Collins Sr. and the late Thomasina “Tessie” Galgano Collins, Eva was born in Bristol on Sept. 6, 1939, where she resided most of her life, married, raised her family, and worked, providing endless optimism to those around her. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of her favorite memories from her time away, however, includes the years she lived in North Carolina when she captained her eighth-grade basketball team, during the time her father served in the Marine Corps and her family lived at Camp Lejeune.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She returned to Bristol for high school, but she did not finish, leaving before graduation to have the first of her five boys. Eventually, she returned to the classroom to earn her GED, years after rejoining the workforce, first at Lee Spring, where she was a machine operator, advancing to set-up person. She was endlessly curious, constantly learning and applying what she learned. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later, at Superior Electric, she would work her way from the factory floor to become a switchboard operator&nbsp;and win over the engineers to assume responsibility for internal communications, advising about phone equipment, and installing and programming it. She was a marvel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She ended her career as a switchboard operator&nbsp;at ESPN just a few years ago, after too many years of working when others her age had retired. That did not stop her from calling back when she encountered issues with the phone system. And she always managed to keep in touch with former workmates.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hers was a rich amalgam of her mother’s Italian romanticism and her father’s old Yankee pragmatism. She read endlessly, tried her hand at drawing and writing, and worked industriously to support, encourage and protect the ones she loved.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she cooked. Holidays, birthdays, of course. Short visits always included at least one question/request: “Let me get you something to eat?” Her homemade <em>manicott</em>i was a treat. Terrific. Of course, once she tried baking cheesecakes and learned we loved them, she must have produced a couple hundred--there was no stopping her. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She acknowledged birthdays and anniversaries with homemade cakes, cards with personal notes, phone calls peppered with “I love yous,” and presents. She could never do enough for her loved ones. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christmases were truly magical, providing her with a reason to perform miracles, not only for her own children but for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She loved her plants and wall hangings, word games, including crosswords and word jumbles, along with watching Jeopardy! and cheering on Stephen Curry and his Golden State Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of all she loved her family, which extended far beyond blood ties. Often a member of the extended family or a family friend might be camping out for a night or weeks on the couch or sequestered in one of the bedrooms which barely accommodated family members, and no one thought it was an imposition. No matter what, there would be food on the stove, clean clothes, and much love. Among her favorites were Alex “Spec” Monico and the late Jay Trelli. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a beautiful spirit but also a stunningly beautiful woman. A photo from her wedding album captures her exiting the limousine--Ava Gardner had nothing on her.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eva leaves four of her five sons, a fifth having predeceased her. They include David and spouse Mary, Edward, James and Gary, all of Bristol; 12 grandchildren: Brett and partner Megan of Bristol, Nicholas and spouse Rachel of Bridgeport, Brandon and spouse Stephanie of Bristol, Elizabeth and spouse Thomas of Norwalk, Gregory and partner Allison of Melbourne, Australia, Genevieve of Turners Falls, Mass., Dominique of San Diego, Calif., Christy of Bristol, Chelsea of Bristol, Haley and spouse Tylon of Waterbury, Hannah and partner Becky of Waterbury and Serenity of Bristol; two brothers, Louis E. Collins Jr. of Bristol and Thomas Collins of Florida; three nephews, Todd and Mark Collins of Bristol and Jason Collins of Florida; and 18 great-grandchildren, of whom she could never get enough of. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was predeceased by her husband, Jimmy, and her son, Glenn. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family is especially appreciative of the efforts of her son, Jimmy, who was her caretaker for these past years, as well as the care of Jimmy’s daughters and Eva’s grandchildren, Hannah and Haley. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friends and family are invited to a Mass of Christian Burial at St. Joseph Church, 33 Queen St., Bristol, on Monday, July 10, at 11 a.m. The family will greet friends beginning at 10 a.m. at the church. Burial will follow at St. Joseph Cemetery in Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Eva’s name to the Boys and Girls Club of Bristol, 255 West St., Bristol, CT 06010.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
