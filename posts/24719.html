<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The last couple of scholastic seasons, the Bristol Central baseball team hasn’t exactly exploded out of the gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, the Rams lost their first three games – including a tough 4-3 loss at Plainville on April 11 – and four out of five before eventually surging as the month of May rolled around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this crew, loaded with some good senior talent, has already gotten to the pay window twice in 2023 – and that goes a long way early on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning now instead of catching up later is always a desirable situation to be in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams opened their new season with an impressive 5-0 shutout of Hall from West Hartford on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on April 7, in an early afternoon affair versus Plainville, Central broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh to spin the Blue Devils 2-1 in a CCC South entanglement. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got a couple wins early and I only think we’re going to get better and better and better as the season goes on,” said Central coach Bunty Ray. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experience counts in copious amounts and any thoughts of a slow start were immediately squashed with that opening season win on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Central pitching has allowed only one run as the defense has been quick to make plays on the field, whether its transfer Joe Gratta in centerfield or jack of all trades Mike Allan hanging out at shortstop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crew last year almost saw its season spin out of control due to early season setbacks and general tomfoolery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four of Central’s first six losses were by three runs or less, but this year’s squad has already shown the ability to turn things around and fight until the final out is recorded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Last year, we got out to a slow start,” said Ray. “This year, it’s a little quicker and we still are not really playing great baseball. There’s a lot of things to clean up but I think there’s a lot of upside.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will be a big key to having a successful season in 2023?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Counting on all those veterans, starting with big Frank Spirito IV – the All-Stater heading off to the University of Connecticut this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His pitching and bat are going to be the difference maker in several upcoming games this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know Christian Stafford has a stick and plays a mean third base, Ryan Ring is a veteran catcher that makes few mistakes behind the plate and Allan’s defense is top-notched.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s just a sampling of Central’s senior core.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throw in Jack Bellantuono, Seth Bissonnette, Nick Krompegal, and Dom Guzzardi and you have plenty of leadership that goes around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, when the team does something good on the field, that dugout has been loud and up for every play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central can stay the course, turn to those seniors and an exceptionally good pitching staff, the baseball team from up on the hill is going to be incredibly pleased by the time the state tournament comes around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think you see the energy is different this year,” said Ray. “I think they’re a little bit older, a little more confident. I really think they’re picking each other up not just because it was a game-winning hit in the last inning [Plainville]. We would have done that anyway. You can see these guys engaged in the game. They’re playing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Rams are in action twice next week</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central baseball is back home on Monday at 3:45 p.m., battling Middletown in a CCC South incursion while on Friday, the Rams invade Beehive Field for a showdown against New Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The man behind the field&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central baseball team competes on William T. McCooey field at the school and it’s important to know who that outstanding coach, mentor and teacher was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to his bio from the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame website (BSHOF.org), McCooey was “a 1945 Bristol High graduate, [he] made significant contributions to Bristol through his avid love of sports, in particular, the game of baseball.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A scholastic pitching star, he also excelled in Army and college ball and performed for a number of surrounding area semi-pro teams.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He became a physical education and health teacher at both Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central High Schools and launched Central’s basketball program in 1959.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In addition to coaching soccer and baseball at the school for a number of years, he was an official scorer for the Bristol Red Sox between 1978-83 (before the team tried to sneak off to Maine), a recreation director for the city for 20 years and a member of the Connecticut High School Coaches Association.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
