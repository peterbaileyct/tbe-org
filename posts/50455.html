<p>Bristol Eastern girls soccer opened their season on Tuesday evening with a definitive 4-0 win against New Britain at Veterans&nbsp;Stadium in Willowbrook Park. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a well played match, the Lady Lancers held the Hurricanes to a total of only 4 shots - one on frame, but easily found its way into the hands of Hailey Beebe, the senior keeper for BE. </p>

<p>Though the Lancers controlled play for the majority of the first half, New Britain held BE to only one goal, scored in the 27th minute by freshman Alyssa Chambers. Chambers received a perfect pass into the box from twin sister Rebecca Chambers and put the ball in the net. </p>

<p>Eastern opened the scoring in the second half four minutes in, as Leah Roy rocketed in a header off an Alyssa Chambers corner. Roy, having missed her junior season due to injury, wasted no time in her senior campaign scoring a brace. </p>

<p>Less than seven minutes later off an incredible individual effort to win the ball back from the defense, she slotted a pass into the lower left corner of the net to give the Lancers a 3-0 lead. </p>

<p>Rebecca Chambers found her way to the score sheet with less than a minute left in the game, putting one in the back of the net after making a 40 yard run with the ball off a Maria Perrone pass. </p>

<p>Kate Patterson and Jadalisse&nbsp;Morell rounded out a solid offensive attack for the Lancers. </p>

<p>Bristol Eastern is back on the field today with their home opener, a 3:45 contest with East Hartford at the Lancer Dome.</p>
