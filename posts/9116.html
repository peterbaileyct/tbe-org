<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>KENTUCKY - On November 5, the American Volleyball Coaches Association recently announced its second annual AVCA High School All-Region Teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol Eastern’s outstanding outside hitter, Hannah Webber, made the prestigious list - earning a spot on the Region 1 All-Region Team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total of 10 regions represents all 50 states and Webber joins an impressive group of reward recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number of athletes on each All-Region team&nbsp;is determined by the volume of&nbsp;AVCA High School All-America nominations each region receives.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top fifty-percent of nominated athletes, as selected by the AVCA High School Regional Committees, are named to their respective All-Region team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-Region teams also includes the athletes that will be named to the&nbsp;AVCA High School All-American First Team, Second Team, Third Team, and Honorable Mention All-American squads as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Region 1 is made up of every New England state, save Vermont, along with New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven outstanding players earned honors from the Nutmeg State, including two athletes that call the Central Connecticut Conference home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber has been nothing less than sensational for the Eastern program, leading the way to an outstanding 18-5 ledger and a CCC Tournament Championship title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season, Webber has collected just under 500 kills as the senior knows how to drop the hammer on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also leads the Lancers in aces (71) and blocked shots (26) going into the Simsbury showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber also has bumped up 122 digs and even has 21 assists when not killing the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether she’s dropping 43 kills in a CCC Tournament showdown against Conard or helping her mates start a match on a 19-0 run, Webber has been a team leader and a role model for the younger players on the squad to emulate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setter Nyssa Park from Conard was the other CCC player that earned AVCA honors this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2021&nbsp;AVCA High School&nbsp;All-America Teams will be announced on Wednesday, November 10.&nbsp;</p>
