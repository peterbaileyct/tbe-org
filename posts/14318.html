<p>The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to repeal Roe v. Wade is a travesty. Now more than ever, we must rely on our state legislators to keep our strong laws protecting women’s reproductive health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s be clear, 70 percent of America disagrees with this decision made by the Supreme Court. It was a politically motivated judgement by those that should be above these manipulative efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that this immense responsibility rests solely with the states, we must remember: our legislators are supposed to represent the will of the people. Protecting a woman’s right to choose is clearly the will of the people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need to make it known that this will not be tolerated. We must hold our legislators accountable. This election cycle, we will determine that path that Connecticut will take. Voting has never been more important. I'm confident voters will see that, too.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access ten (10) articles per week.</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email editor@bristoledition.org for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em> <em>People with financial difficulties may write editor@bristoledition.org to be considered for free access.</em></p>
