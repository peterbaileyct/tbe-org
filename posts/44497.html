<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team hosted Berlin on Monday afternoon and were in a dogfight from the beginning! Ultimately the girls lost 16-15, but the outcome was in doubt throughout  the contest.</p>

<p>The teams were tied or within 1 or 2 goals the whole game as neither team was able to put together any sustained runs. </p>

<p>A yellow card on Berlin when they were up by two goals with 4:54 in the fourth allowed the Lancers to take advantage of the man-up situation for a goal off a free position shot, then another goal to tie things up with just under 3 minutes to go. </p>

<p>The Redcoats then won possession on the draw and scored with just under three minutes left. That left one final draw to decide the game and Berlin won possession.&nbsp; They immediately ran the ball to their own defensive corner to run out the clock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Megan Krok was phenomenal on defense for the Lancers along with Jayna Hatcher in protecting keeper Erin Martin. Martin made several spectacular saves as the Redcoats were shooting from all angles.</p>

<p>On offense, Vanessa Drury led with seven goals and an assist. Emma Stavens notched four goals and two assists while Harper Dauphinee contributed three goals and Savannah Drury one.</p>

<p>Leah Roy did all the little things to try to help the Lancers get the victory. She battles at draw control and is a ground ball specialist for Eastern.</p>

<p>Eastern next hosts St. Paul on Thursday in a 4:30 p.m. start.</p>
