<p>Another social media threat, this time involving gun violence, is behind today's school closings.</p>

<p>"Dear Bristol Public Schools Community," acting superintendent Iris White writes in a post via the school parent portal, ParentSquare last evening around 9:30 p.m., "Earlier this evening BPS was alerted to a social media post describing the threat of a school shooting at both of our Bristol high schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This information was forwarded to the Bristol Police Department for further investigation. Out of an abundance of caution, Bristol Public Schools will be closed on Friday, September 20, 2024. All buildings will be closed."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The threat follows several social media posts that have prompted action by the superintendent and involved Bristol Police. On Wednesday, Sept. 18, White alerted parents to a social media post "about an indirect threat toward Northeast Middle School (NEMS)," in which BPS were collaborating with police.</p>

<p>At the time, no immediate threat was indicated and there was no effect on school operations. Earlier, on Sept. 12, social media threats by an irate parent led to his arrest outside Hubbell Elementary School. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
