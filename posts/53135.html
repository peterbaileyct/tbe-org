<p>The photo contest resulting in "Celebrate Bristol 2025" was held to help mark Wheeler’s move to a new community health center and administrative headquarters at One Hope Street. A panel of community judges evaluated and selected images for inclusion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly 80 photos were submitted by people from Bristol and beyond, and images lovingly captured the very best of the city, from its parks and downtown area to its neighborhoods, trails, schools, and more.</p>

<p>A digital copy of the calendar is available <a href="https://wheelerhealth.online/CelebrateBristol">here</a>.</p>
