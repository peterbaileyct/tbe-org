<p>BRISTOL - Correctly put, the <em>Rams</em> rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At least that’s the thought after the Bristol Central softball team’s 6-1 triumph over Wolcott on Thursday afternoon in a non-conference tilt from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s absolutely no confusing that as Central’s Sophia Torreso dominated in the circle - posting 15 strikeouts - while Lorelei Stancavage went a slick 4-for-4 from the dish - collecting five RBI - as the Rams improved to a sterling 13-2 with two games to go over a hectic week of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of make-ups, the Rams were forced to play six games this week as the program has gone 4-0 over that grueling stretch, allowing the opposition just two total runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Eagles, Torreso gave up minimal hits throughout her complete game effort - striking out the final five batters she faced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I feel like she got stronger as the game went on,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “When she’s feeling it, she usually does get stronger as the game goes on. She had a great performance today. She scattered five hits. Her curve and drop-balls were working today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott fell to 12-3 overall as Central put an end to the Eagles’ three-game winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abby Wrinn led Wolcott with two hits, including a double, but the squad was never able to seriously challenge Central thanks to Torreso and a stingy defensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrinn dropped her two-base hit to the gap in right with two away in the first frame but never advanced as the Rams were aggressive at the plate from the onset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central netted a run in the bottom of the first, seeing it first five batters reach base safely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone, Sam Sklenka bunted aboard, moved to second on a steal and reach third base via error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Stancavage dropped a one-hopper into center, plating a run, as the Rams nabbed a 1-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had the bases loaded with one out but a double play saw Alex Sciarretto fly-out to center while the runner from third was doubled up at the dish as it remained a one-run game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso continued to mow down the competition in the top of the second, fanning the side, as the Rams quickly came back up to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She pitched really efficient innings today,” said Hayes of Torreso. “They weren’t long innings, they weren’t spread out.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fun offensively never stopped for Central as Mya Porrini walked to open the second, Sarah Romano (2-for-3, run scored) singled up the middle while Adrianna Lubrico bunted the duo over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Kaley Laird (2-for-3, RBI, two runs scored) smoked a single to center to score Porrini, making it a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stancavage cleared the bases with her flare to center for two RBI and quickly, it was a 4-0 game in Central’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott’s Sam Dean dropped in a one-out single to start the third - breaking a string of four consecutive Ks by Torreso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a pop-up and Torreso strikeout, Dean was stranded as Central continued to lead if by four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott’s Kaitlyn Ouellette fanned the Central side in the third, but the visiting aggression was still stuck in neutral as the fourth inning quickly commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Ryleigh Hall made a slick catch in right field to open the fourth while Lubrico, at first base, made a sweet pick-up off a Laird throw from shortstop to end the frame as Central sat down 10 of Wolcott’s last 11 batters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Defensively, we made plays behind Torreso that I thought were pretty decent,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams padded its cushion in the bottom of the fourth as Romano singled on and Lubrico turned her sacrifice bunt into an infield hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two outs later, with runners still on first and second, Stancavage added her third hit of the event. - a blistering double deep to right - as she cleared the bases to make it a 6-0 tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles made things mildly interesting in the fifth with one out as Central could not make a play on two consecutive ground balls - putting two on for Wolcott.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with two gone, Ouellette blasted a two-base hit into center as Mayci Arrange scored to cut the deficit to 6-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Torreso ended up striking out the side - leaving two runners in scoring position - as the Rams still led by five through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrinn led off the sixth with her second hit of the game, a single to right, but the Rams buckled down to get out of jam as Torreso scooped up strikeouts 11 and 12 to end the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central attempted to add to its till in the bottom of the sixth as Laird was plunked by a pitch and Stancavage tallied her fourth hit but Wolcott did not allow a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still 6-1 going into the seventh and Torreso cruised to the victory - generating three more strikeouts for a total of 15 - as Central won again, taking a five-run decision, moving to 13-2 overall, and are currently ranked fifth in the Class LL standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a pretty efficient game, offensively and defensively,” said Hayes. “I’m pretty proud of this team right now.”</p>
