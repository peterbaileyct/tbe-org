<p>Now that Bristol has unveiled the beautifully renovated Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School, the next logical step is the theater's opening&nbsp;for public performances. According to school and park department officials, the public will have to wait until next year for that to happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Memorandum of Agreement&nbsp;(MoA), which sets the dates and conditions for when&nbsp;the school will use the theater and when it will be available to the public, has not yet been signed by the Parks Department.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Joshua Medeiros,&nbsp;Superintendent for the Department of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services,&nbsp;"The Board of Education has submitted a&nbsp;‘Joint Use Agreement’&nbsp;to my office but the document has not yet been signed. We are still reviewing the proposal and the fee schedule provided by the BOE&nbsp;(Board of Education). Additionally, it's my understanding that the theater is not fully complete and that public access is unlikely until early 2023."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Superintendent of Schools Dr. Catherine Carbone&nbsp;verified the information about the&nbsp;MoA and confirmed Dr. Medeiros's remarks, especially regarding equipment&nbsp;and production items.&nbsp;"We are waiting on drapery, audiovisual,&nbsp;lighting, mixing equipment, and field adjustment of mezzanine seating.&nbsp;What is most important is we&nbsp;cannot commission the&nbsp;theater&nbsp;until&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the equipment&nbsp;is installed. As you can imagine, this is state&nbsp;of the art equipment and the theater acoustician&nbsp;will finalize the tuning of the room.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carbone&nbsp;went on to say they&nbsp;are anticipating&nbsp;using&nbsp;the theater for winter concerts&nbsp;and public events.&nbsp;“We&nbsp;are very excited about the promise this building will bring to the city at this difficult time."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the delay, Medeiros is confident the theatre will be up and running soon, "I know the city fully understands the value the community theater will bring to downtown development, quality of life, etc., and we look forward to having it programmed in the near future!"</p>

<p>In related news,&nbsp;Lauren&nbsp;Imholte, Bristol's first Supervisor of&nbsp;Arts &amp; Culture,&nbsp;who&nbsp;began in June of 2021 and was hired by the city to manage the theatre, resigned in September, Medeiros said, as her husband got his dream job out of state and they were moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According&nbsp;to&nbsp;Medeiros,&nbsp;no decision has been made on her replacement. He told the TBE, "We have not moved to repost the position at this time, but I expect to have some determinations made soon." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medeiros added, "Our Recreation Supervisor Amry Shelby has assumed some responsibilities managing the existing arts programs and special events and I have assumed responsibility to the City’s Arts and Culture Commission. At this time no one is booking shows for the theater; I expect that to be fleshed out in the re-posting of the Arts and Culture Supervisor or a variation of that job depending on what the City decides.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
