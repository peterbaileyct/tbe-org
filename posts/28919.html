<p>On her way to joining up with the women’s soccer program at Central Connecticut State University in the fall, Rachel Wygant picked up yet another postseason award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Central High School girls soccer standout, due to her outstanding achievements in the classroom and on the pitch, recently earned an All-American honor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Thursday, the United Soccer Coaches unveiled its 2022-23 High School Scholar All-American awards and Wygant was on that prestigious list.</p>

<p>Four athletes from Connecticut earned a spot on the All-America list which focused on Grade Point Average and Wygant, a model student athlete from the classrooms at BCHS, carried a GPA that would stand out at any high school across the nation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Wygant was the only female soccer player from the Nutmeg State to earn that All-American distinction.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the winners from the boys, like Michael Kluger (5.0 GPA) from Hopkins in New Haven, came from private institutions and schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant performed the same feat in a public-school setting which proves that anything is possible if you put the work in no matter the surroundings or environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s put all sorts of work in, whether it was prepping for soccer or lacrosse and then turned around to show that same guts and guile in the classroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant churned out a GPA of 4.13, meaning she aced just about everything she did at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a tremendous honor and a big credit to Wygant’s entire family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central had a big year in 2022-23</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-Stater had one heck of a senior campaign as Central’s girls soccer team went a tremendous 9-5-2 overall regular season play this past fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forward had some big moments as a senior captain for the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s first home match came against Plainville on September 13. Wygant dropped in two goals over the winning effort as BCHS snatched a huge 3-0 shutout win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Conard on September 15, the Rams were trailing 1-0 after one period of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming from behind, Wygant kicked both of Central’s second-half goals to tally a huge 2-1 triumph as the squad started the campaign out at 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly a month later, she helped defeat Berlin on October 20 with a goal and then a late penalty kick gave her the winning score as Central came away a 3-2 victor over the Redcoats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant played extremely well for every team she competed on and expect some big things from the standout at CCSU over the next four years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her collegiate debut comes next month on August 17 at Siena.</p>
