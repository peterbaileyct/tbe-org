<p>A block party hosted by Yellow King Brews at Bristol Bazaar last weekend attracted 75 people, who were treated to live musical entertainment and vendors offering their wares.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People are saying its [the business] is a hidden gem,” store manager Hannah Maghini said about Yellow King Brews. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The block parties are a good way of getting to know Bristol and for Bristol to get to know Yellow King Brews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Saturday, July 27, event was the second in as many months and brought back vendors from the first event and featured new musical entertainment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event hosted vendors such as Hecho by Helena, a Latina shop with cups, stickers and more, CT Pop Shop that sold popcorn and more. New Haven Underground Jazz played at the event while Rock Solid Grill catered the event as the cocktail and coffee bar was open to the public.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To publish the event, Maghini said Yellow King used social media to connect with people who might be interested in these types of events.</p>

<p>Some residents of other town, such as Milford, also attended the event.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
