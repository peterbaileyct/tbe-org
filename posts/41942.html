<p>Wheeler Health is moving its headquarters to downtown Bristol and combining both of its existing health centers at One Hope Street, in Centre Square. Through Wheelers health centers, residents of Bristol and surrounding towns have access to integrated primary and behavioral health care, for all ages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For 55 years, in every Bristol school, at its centers, Wheeler has served the community’s most pressing health needs.<a href="https://www.wheelerclinic.org/download_file/view/4051/1965"></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sponsoring a brick helps promote these services. All proceeds will go toward our Campaign for Bristol, which will help to fund construction and services at One Hope Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plan is for the bricks to be on prominent walkways to, and near, the entrances to One Hope Street.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
