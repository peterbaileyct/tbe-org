<p>BRISTOL - The volleyball showdown between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern programs this past Thursday night was an epic showdown - a no-miss event that did not disappoint in the least</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers (6-3 overall) had to fight scratch and claw their way to the win after trailing 2-0 while falling behind in both the third and fifth frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern won the match by set scores of 23-25, 21-25, 25-21, 25-18 and 15-12, a signature victory for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that fight in a contest that concluded in September was a big showing for the Kingstreeters at this point of the year - now winners of three straight matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s a bonus because that’s a fantastic test for us right now,” said Eastern coach Stefaine Reay. “And to be this early in the season still and fighting like that, the improvement already this season is drastic.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every player that took the court that evening made positive gains for the Lancers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Adrianna Reay (34 kills, 24 digs, four aces, two blocks) was the best player on the court that night while teammate Gabby Caucci (18 kills, 22 digs, two aces) helped provide a tremendous 1-2 punch that gave Central’s defense fits.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setter Naseem Hennouch produced 50 assists and 19 digs, Andrea Martir-Perez nabbed three aces and 25 digs, Samara Paranzino added two kills and six digs while the defensive Savannah Drury bumped up 10 digs to help the cause.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the ever-improving Kamila Mateo-Rivera blocked two blocked from the front line over a big reserve effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m even more excited because I know how much improvement we still have to make,” said Reay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Eastern came to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on a 56-game winning streak against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams ended that hex via a 3-0 romp and Eastern was looking to reignite the streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the first match between the two Bristol schools this year, the Kingstreeters were able to turn the tables on the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It gives us a ton of energy because all these girls know as a team how much we have to work on,” said Reay of Eastern beating Central. “To do this and fight this way and to have this result now gives them more desire to do the same thing throughout the season.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are fighting for each other, they are playing for each other, and they are a fantastic group of girls.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Dominance still belongs with Eastern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The series between the squads still belongs to the Kingstreeters and by a wide margin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has won 68 of the past 72 matches against Central, a string of games that dates back to the second match of 1985.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That rematch in 1985 went five sets as Eastern won 13-15, 15-7, 15-6, 10-15 and 15-7 - setting that slate of Lancers’ success into motion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five set matches are rare in city series play and since that five-set war in 1985, only nine of those matches have taken place in city series play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is 6-3 in those five-set wars - winning the last six in a row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have won three straight matches and Eastern will look to extend it to four with a CCC interdivisional bout at Conard on Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 5 p.m. from West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
