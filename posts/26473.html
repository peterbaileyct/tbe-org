<p>Gov. Ned Lamont, Mayor Jeff Caggiano and the entire Bristol state legislative delegation used Muzzy Field as the setting to announce that the city has been awarded a Connecticut Recreational Trails Program grant of $320,000 for the planning and design of a bike/pedestrian trail from Rockwell Park through the West End and Downtown to the bike lane recently created at the Memorial Boulevard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The long-range plan is that the Rockwell-Boulevard trail will eventually connect to the Farmington Canal Trail in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, the city of Bristol partnered with the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments (NVCOG) to engage the public in a study to gather information about how best to accommodate all users. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NVCOG conducted interviews with stakeholders, created an online survey to gather public feedback, developed an interactive map, conducted public information meetings, held a walk audit in the area where the trail will be located, and provided frequent updates to the Bristol community to help guide the planning process. <br></p>

<p><br><br>State Sen. Henri Martin, and state representatives Cara Pavalock-D’Amato, Joe Hoxha, and Mary Fortier all spoke of the positive impact the project will have for the city, especially for the West End and downtown areas. Martin and Fortier both mentioned that this project has been envisioned for a long time, dating back to almost 2010, and it is a great thing for Bristol to see the idea come to fruition.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano stated that this project will mesh perfectly with another recent state grant the city received, the $6.8 Community Investment Fund grant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not only are we going to build a bike path from here (Rockwell Park) all the way to the Boulevard, we are also going to be working on safe accessible streetscapes and walkways for people as well. Thanks to the Governor and State Legislature for that help,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano also mentioned the $2 million grant from the state that is allowing Bristol to do the brownfield remediation at the Sessions building on Riverside Avenue. The city hopes to turn the building over to a developer who will create a workforce housing development there, he said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamont alluded to all the ongoing projects Bristol has brewing and said a lot of people will find our city an attractive place to live. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They love the size and the quality of schools, they like the walkability, they love Muzzy Field," he said, "and every time we can make a small improvement affecting people’s lives, I think we’re making a difference.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
