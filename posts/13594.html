<p>The Bristol boys and girls lacrosse teams from Bristol battled on a busy Friday afternoon but all three public school programs drew tough losses in qualifying round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Class L girls lacrosse, No. 11 Bristol Central squared off against No. 22 Norwich Free Academy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Kyle Phelan’s crew over at Bristol Central fell by a 15-6 decision from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This was the final game for Ella Watson, Sydney Rodriguez, Madison Secor, Maddie Ross and Alyah Rodriguez-Warren,” said Phelan via Twitter. “You will all be missed! Great season girls! Proud of all of you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to 10-5-1 but had a very good season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a Class M showdown, the girls lacrosse program at Eastern fell on the road to No. 15 St. Joseph by a 20-7 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first ever state tournament game for the 18th ranked Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kayla Policarpio troops battled but simply took on a far more experienced program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss ended up being the final contest for Eastern seniors Alison Sullivan, Audra Porowski, and Ciara Collins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sullivan and Porowski just started playing the sport only a couple years ago while Collins was All-Conference over everything she did from her freshman year on in girls soccer, basketball, and lacrosse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended the campaign at 7-10 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a Class L boys lacrosse qualifier, the No. 13 ranked Bristol co-op program dropped a tough 13-1 decision to No. 20 Fairfield Warde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern ended the season at 10-8 and had a banner season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss saw the senior core of Chris Sirois, Nate Shorette, Ayden Cross, and Andrew Spina play in their final match for the Bristol program.</p>
