<p>NEW HAVEN - The Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys track teams were heavily involved at the CIAC Class L Boys Indoor Track &amp; Field Championships from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both the Rams and Lancers scored points along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern took home 15th place with nine points while Central (19th place, six points) wasn’t that far behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scored six team points, good for 19th place at the Class L bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters got most of those points out of senior Jack Mulcunry in the 600 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was just a bit off the winning time, squaring away a second-place finish of 1:23.91.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier’s Nick Cassarino won the race in 1:23.62 as the event came down to a near photo finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other team point came via the 1600 sprint medley team from Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preston Poirier, Raison Andrews, Dominic Tartarelli and Jack Mulcunry scored a point off their sixth-place finish of 3:48.81.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But several other athletes were just a couple places away from scoring points as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the preliminary round of the 55-meter dash, Rayshon Andrews (6.68 seconds) was just a hair away in qualifying for the championship heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Dominic Tartarelli nabbed an excellent tally in the 1000 meters, placing eighth overall in 2:45.94.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ 4x200 relay squad just placed out of the scoring round in its heat from New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Andrews, Mulcunry, Zion Otero and Poirier finished in seventh place (1:37.80), which was just off the sixth-place mark by Edwin O. Smith (1:37.42).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers’ 4x800 relay team of Tartarelli, Cole Beland, Aidan Tartarelli and Aidan Gezelman ended the race in tenth place (9:01.49).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then for the Rams, one athlete managed to tally all the team points for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Frankie Porrini did extremely well in the 1600 meters as the senior standout made a third-place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speedster ended his event in 4:27.64 - placing behind two runners from Xavier which included Owen Martin (first place, 4:25.80).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams in the 1600, Patrick Wininger ended the race in 14th place (4:51.17).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys pole vault saw Central’s Jude Browning take 10th place with a make of 10 feet even.</p>
