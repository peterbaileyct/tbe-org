<p>BRISTOL - It’s week two of the scholastic football campaign and Bristol Central is looking to get to the pay window for the first time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have an early start against South Windsor on Friday and look to slow down a high-powered offense on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had too many turnovers in a tough 21-14 loss to Manchester last week but showed enough promise to turn the thing around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Central lost a close opener to Bloomfield and then ran off nine straight to end the regular campaign - including a home triumph against South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will it be a revenge week for the program or is this Bristol team destined to start the year at 0-2?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to look for as Central hits the road on Friday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (0-1) at South Windsor (1-0)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>4:15 p.m. (South Windsor turf field). Do they not have lights for their field yet?!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Game: </strong>The showdown is a rematch from exactly one year ago. The Rams won 21-0 back on September 17 - one of two shutouts for Central last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: This is the 15th battle between the squads with Central leading 9-5 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week: </strong>South Windsor battered unmanned Farmington 45-23 while Central fell to Manchester 21-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Game Facts: </strong>South Windsor sent Farmington to its 12th consecutive loss last week. Hey, take that as you will…The Bobcats led just 21-17 at the half but outscored the River Hawks 24-6 the rest of the way…Central must be wary of both South Windsor’s rushing and passing attacks…QB Ethan LaGuardia (21 rushes, 100 yards) got the job done on both fronts (5-of-8 passing, 264 yards) but the Rams have better options in the backfield to handle those passing attacks…Wyatt Cote (12-121) led the Bobcats overall rushing onslaught against Farmington…Central led 7-0 against Manchester but just couldn’t sustain the edge after that first score…Three fourth period turnovers - with the score still at 7-7 - led to doom and demise…Central had Manchester right where it wanted on several occasions but simply let the opponent off the hook…The Rams had the game tied at 14-14 with just over 90 seconds to play but Manchester nabbed the game-winning score with 1:34 left and the home team could not answer…Manchester outgunned the Rams in overall yardage, 351-218…Central stats guru David Greenleaf noted that quarterback Nik Salinas debuted with 12 carries for 51 yards and a touchdown while making three of seven passes for 62 yards and a TD…Carmelo Thompson is going to be a good one as the sophomore running back unloaded for 51 yards on 12 carries while also catching a Salinas pass for a TD…Speedster Tre Blair scooped up 80 yards from scrimmage - making 10 rushes for 44 yards while snaring a ball for a 36 yard catch…Geovannie Colon cashed in on half-a-dozen carries and Greenleaf was quick to praise the kicking game of Ken Whitford (two extra points) and Oscar Kuzniar (three kickoffs for touchbacks)…Central's Can Tomak and Anthony Paulino both made an interception for the locals…If mistakes and errors can be cleaned up, the Rams have a good chance to snare their first victory in South Windsor.</p>
