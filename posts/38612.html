<p>Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz hip-hopped through three Bristol businesses Wednesday morning as part of a campaign to encourage people to support small businesses in their hometowns.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bysiewicz began her day at the Bristol Bazaar, accompanied by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano, Economic Development Director Justin Malley and State Rep. Joe Hoxha. She spoke with the owners, Care and Eric Verikas, and was impressed by the variety of handmade products available from the work of local artists and vendors.</p>

<p>After her visit to the Bristol Bazaar, Bysiewicz took a two-minute ride to see Bristol Works, which is a workforce development training center. The goal of Bristol Works is to provide individuals with skills, certifications and job-placement services to obtain employment or to allow them to continue with advanced programs. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The director, Kim Ward Holley explained to the lieutenant governor that Bristol Works offers four training programs (Manufacturing, IT, Early Childhood Education, and Healthcare) that are free to those who live or work in Bristol and are available to all others for a fee. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Bristol Bazaar and Bristol Works were funded through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which was passed by Congress and signed into law by&nbsp;President Biden in 2021 to speed up the country's recovery from economic effects of the Covid pandemic&nbsp;and the ongoing&nbsp;recession. Many Bristol businesses and non-profits benefitted from ARPA funding.</p>

<p><br>The final stop of the morning was Family Roots Produce Market on Riverside Avenue. Bysiewicz spoke with April Tibbetts, the general manager at the store. Tibbetts explained that Family Roots takes pride in supporting local farmers and offering the public fruits and vegetables from nearby producers. Family Roots also offers baked goods, breads, coffee, hot sauce, spices, jams, pickles, cheeses and honey from Connecticut businesses.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
