<h4><strong>150 Years Ago – December 1871</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christmas was very generally celebrated in town according to the fashion of the times, the custom of the churches and the taste of the individual. All of the churches except the Congregational had exercises of one kind or another.</p>

<p>Mr. George Hall, a blacksmith, when returning from the Christmas festival, discovered a broken rail about three feet in length with the end pointing toward the approaching train. He gave a signal by wrapping a red handkerchief around a lantern in time for the train to stop. The conductor upbraided him for giving the signal, saying the train could have jumped the rail, but the engineer sided with Mr. Hall, thanking him for his timely signal.</p>

<p>On Monday evening, there was great ringing of skate metal on Muzzy’s Mill pond. Many were the skaters, among them Leck Lee and Wals Lee.&nbsp; The latter gave chase to the former. Leck fell in and wet himself and Wals went tumbling after. The bath was not fatal to either, only to their evening of entertainment.</p>

<p>Bristol’s present lockup is a delight to Weary Willies and other wayward tenants of the institution. The big hole that was punched some time ago remains and when a prisoner becomes weary of detention he simply crawls out. That makes it easier for the officers who are relieved of the necessity of unlocking the door. One of these days a new brick jail with steel cages will need to be built.</p>

<p>There was a narrow escape from a fatal accident at the Main St. crossing. James Quinn, a traveling salesman from New York, crawled under the gates as the 7:40 east bound train was approaching and stumbled and fell while the incoming train was 50 feet away. Lester Nearing, who was nearby, at considerable personal risk grabbed him and succeeded in pulling him to the platform. He escaped with nothing more than bruises and a fright. The engineer had reversed the train and closed his eyes but happily was spare the horror of an accident.</p>
