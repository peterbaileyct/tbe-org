<p>The Bristol Blues have certainly been the talk of the New England Collegiate Baseball League this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an off-season over the summer of 2021, the locals have bounced back in a major way – staging one of Bristol’s best seasons in recent memory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going into its final game on Saturday, Bristol has put together several tremendous individual offensive performances as the regular season is about to close.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at some of those notable performers (stats are as of Thursday, July 28):&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Chaz Myers </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers has been impressive through his 36 games, posting a team-leading .377 batting average and will finish the campaign as Bristol’s top batter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers smacked out a team-high 40 hits while drilling three home runs which are both team-leading totals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shortstop has scooped up 18 RBI, walked 11 times, and swiped five bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers was seven RBI behind Derek Tenney for first place on the Blues’ squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The slugger has a dozen games with at least two hits this season including six contests of three hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, Myers was hitting just .211 to open the campaign, batting 4-for-19 before simply taking off.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his last 87 at-bats, Myers has posted 36 hits – good for a .414 batting average since that slow start.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Jay Harry </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 31 games, he batted .316 with 31 hits and 11 runs scored.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry walked nine times, was hit by a pitch on four occasions, stole three bases while collecting 16 RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another quality shortstop for the Bristol program, he maintained his solid batting average over the hot month of July – never letting it dip under .300 over the back-half of the month.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry has six multi-hit games this season including a four-hit, three-RBI gem over a tough 12-7 loss at Vineyard back on July 8.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Myers and Harry are the only two batters on the team hitting better than .300 for the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Derek Tenney </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney has been another quality hand as the Blues went on to win the Western Division title this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first baseman played in 32 games as of Thursday, batting .277 with 26 hits, 17 runs scored, and two homers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His two home runs are tied for second on the squad as Tenney has been called upon to clear the bases over the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney’s 25 RBI leads the Bristol squad while also earning 13 walks and stealing seven bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He collected seven RBI in the 8-1 victory over North Adams on July 14 and added another five in Bristol’s 14-8 win against Danbury.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His season-high four hits came in that triumph over North Adams on July 14 – going a slick 4-for-4 that evening. </p>
