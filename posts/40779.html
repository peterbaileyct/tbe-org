<p><strong>Joe Kapp from Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Wednesday marks the first anniversary of the death of a local and national hero. Joseph Robert Kapacziewski (1982-2023), a.k.a., Joe Kap or Joe Kapp, who served for 15-plus years in the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Ranger Special Troops Battalion and Regiment Headquarters Company.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe his death took place in Dripping Springs, Texas, on Jan. 23 in leaving his wife, Kimberly, and sons, Wyatt and Cody. His friends were numerous, as were the awards, citations and other honors bestowed upon him.</p>

<p><strong>Nicknames</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week’s column featured nicknames, those given to a son who has the same first name as his father. It distinguishes the two from one another when talking about or to them. I came across some other nicknames which I found interesting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mentioned my late brother, Bill, having a son with his first name. This William is called “Chipper,” and I wonder if that was because they thought that he might be a chip off the old block. Then there’s “Chipper” Jones, who grew up in a large family of boys in Forestville. His true first name is James. Interesting to note, he has a daughter named Jamie.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pasquale Nocera owned the former Nocera’s barber shop in Forestville. He had seven sons and one was called “Sonny.” This fellow’s first name was actually Ralph, and he was the youngest of the Nocera boys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many off-shoots from the name of William. Some are Wilby, Willie, Will and others. Interesting to note is the fact that Willie Rosshirt, a former standout athlete here, is officially Dr. Werner “Willie” Rosshirt. Now I’m going a little off the trail with this. Time to stop for now!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mentioned in a previous column that the lowest sea elevation within the borders of Bristol in Forestville is on East Main Street. However, I didn’t have a number to provide at the time. It’s 197 feet below sea level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ran into Jeff Twombly and his mother, Eleanor, the other day. It had been a few years since I had seen him, and we had an enjoyable, brief conversation. Nice people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individuals that I’ve seen on TV this past week, those living, having contacts or working here -- Ken Crowley (Crowley Auto), Chuck Woodin (Nutmeg TV), Adrian Wojnarowski (ESPN) and Donovan Clingan (UConn men’s hoop).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was ranked by one of the many such services as the 27th best overall in Hartford County. I know we’re better than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thomas A. Lorenzetti Sr. -- WWII hero and good citizen</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thomas, who died here in 2008 at the age of 87, was a man I always admired. A longtime Bristol resident, he was a distinguished U.S. Army veteran of WWII. Among the honors he earned after serving in three separate battles were the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts with Oak Leaf Clusters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the war, he settled down and got married, having helped raise three boys and two girls. I have the privilege of knowing his son, Tom, and Tom’s son, Tom, who is my son, Jamie’s age. They played Little League together. And, according to Tom, Jr., he, his son and grandson have been high school athletes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is so much more, but this is it for now. Outstanding family to say the least.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
