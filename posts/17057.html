<p>The sunbaked landscapes of summer are beginning their transition to an earthy autumn palette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the city, we’re still seeing primarily green foliage from the native trees. However, an upward glance towards the treetops will reveal autumn’s early presence. Trees located in higher elevations are the first to show hints of autumn colors.</p>

<p>The first signs of fall foliage can be seen around the crowns of maple trees. Sugar maples are known for their bright orange autumn pigment, and there are plenty to see around Bristol. Red maples will soon follow.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is currently projecting Oct. 16 – 23 as peak foliage viewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The upcoming week's forecast calls for temperatures in the 70s and 80s with little rain. We'll see how the warm, dry conditions affect the changing fall colors.</p>

<p>The historic neighborhood boasts grand architecture as a backdrop for the early changing leaves. Scores of maples can already be seen turning bright autumn colors.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
