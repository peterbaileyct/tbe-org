<p>BRISTOL – After a big three-goal victory at Plainville on Saturday, the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team took on one of the state’s very best as Glastonbury came to town this past Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Guardians were able to rack up a 3-1 decision over the Lancers from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was only the second road contest for Glastonbury (11-1-2) over its last eight matches as the Lancers once again squared off against an elite program from the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Class LL program is one of the state’s best and over Eastern’s (4-7-3) last four matches, the Kingstreeters battled Glastonbury, Plainville, Middletown and Newington – teams with a combined record of 37-12-5.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol squad has also battled Berlin and undefeated Hall over the course of the campaign as the Lancers have taken on the cream of the CCC crop this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Guardians on a wet Monday afternoon, the visiting aggression took the initial lead and never looked back.<br>Glastonbury’s Robert Meissner (16:00) opened the scoring in the first half as he headed home a corner kick for a 1-0 lead.<br>And then Nathan Infante doubled the Guardians’ edge at 29:30 of the second half,<br>drilling a hard shot into the Lancers’ net from the top of the penalty area to make it a two-goal push.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glastonbury scored one more time as Adam Molusis (21:25) kicked in a goal, taking a shot amid a scramble in front of Eastern's net, as the Eastern deficit reached 3-0.<br>The Lancers trimmed the score to 3-1 with 19:04 left as Connor Policarpio hit a hard<br>line-drive free kick into the Glastonbury net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern never got it any closer as the home team fell 3-1 to a talented Glastonbury program.<br>"Glastonbury had 18 solid players who worked well defending and moving the ball," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "We battled throughout against strong pressure."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back in action today at Wethersfield (3-10-1) at 3:45 p.m. and are looking for a big victory before it will be city series time once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Tuesday, Eastern tangles against Bristol Central (7 p.m.) from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
