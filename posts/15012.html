<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – Bristol starts its playoff run today as the 19U American Legion Baseball program from town takes on Tri-County in a big-time, first round bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it was originally supposed to be Tri-County but in a late day change, Zone 3 challenger Northeast slotted into Bristol’s pod instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Post 2 is squaring off against the Northeast program for the first time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 1 p.m. from Muzzy Field and the contest should be one heck of a battle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitcher Matt Beaucar is slated to start on the hill for Post 2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He carries a record of 2-4 this season, having his share of hard-luck losses along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is ranked 11th overall in postseason play (10-6 in Zone 1, .625), rated second in Pod ‘C.’&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the Northern Division, Pod C, Bristol is lumped in with No. 2 Waterford (21-3), No. 19 Northeast (11-11) and No. 24 Enfield (9-13).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a double elimination format and Post 2, at the very least, will have two postseason games to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall in Connecticut's postseason fray, West Hartford (16-0) is ranked first and did not lose a game in Zone 1 competition this season while Waterford was the second best team in the state record wise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each victor of the eight pods advances to next Saturday’s Super Regional brackets, taking place from both Bristol and Middletown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 hopes to be one of the four teams remaining that makes it back to Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has won five of seven games in July and looks to continue its upwards trend in tournament play against three very good opponents in Pod C.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If healthy, Post 2 has star chucker Roberto Cruz slated for Sunday’s game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The veteran went 4-0 in 2022 and has not tasted defeat in quite some time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tournament Notes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moosup is the lowest ranked squad in the playoff mix this season, going 5-19 overall - finishing last in the Northern Division of Zone 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad defeated Jewett City three times, Danielson, and Tri-Town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Out of the Tournament</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The strangest thing about the postseason this year is the one team from Zone 1 that did not qualify for the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meriden (3-13) was the lone team out of the postseason and the omission of Post 45 was a strange one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is talented and well coached but sometimes, that isn’t enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 45 dropped an early season loss on Bristol this year - sizing up a 5-3 victory over Post 2 on June 16 - and then won a 4-3 decision at Simsbury three days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After starting the campaign at 2-2, Meriden limped to a 1-11 finish, eventually falling out of state tournament contention.</p>
