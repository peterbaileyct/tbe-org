<p>History was made on Monday by Bristol Central pitching stud Sophia Torreso as she tossed a perfect game against Middletown – leading to a massive 13-0 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win pushed the Rams to a neat 3-0 on the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso did not allow a hit or a walk while striking out an incredible 18 batters on her way to the no-no.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the 14 strikeouts teammate Alex Sciarretto tallied against Rocky Hill this past Thursday, the Torreso/Sciarretto connection has combined for 32 Ks over the last two games – a staggering number for any scholastic program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Central sits in fifth place in the most recent GameTimeCT poll for the second straight week and expect the winning and good vibes to continue for the program as the competition increases in ability to end the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, it’s a CCC South confrontation against Plainville at 11 a.m. from the softball field at BCHS and then Friday, it’s a quick trip to Pomperaug in non-conference action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 1:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pomperaug is having a very good season, currently hanging in at 3-1 and can heat up on the scoreboard in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville (2-1) comes into the Central showdown allowing just under 1.7 runs-per-game and carries shutout victories against New Britain (10-0) and Wamogo/Litchfield (15-0).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only setback of the season was a 5-3 loss to Platt on Monday from Tinty Stadium at Plainville High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt’s Emily Hart is a machine on the mound, allowing eight hits while striking out 13 (Central battles the Panthers twice over a six-day period with games on April 21 and April 26) to stave off pesky Plainville.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Geddes can toss the ball over the dish for the Blue Devils, earning a no-hitter against the Wamogo/Litchfield contingent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She zipped up 11 strikeouts over the winning effort against the coop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the plate, speedy Hanna Irons can flat out hit the ball and steal a base or two along the way as Plainville is much improved this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Monica Hayes is 10-1 all-time coaching against Plainville. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 10 victories mark the most wins for Hayes against any single team as coach and mentor of the program at BCHS.  </p>
