<p>Groovy music, ice cream, flavored waters and raffle baskets were relished by fans of “Big Deal Rock” at the Bristol Public Library Coffee House on Thursday.</p>

<p>“We’ve been doing these musical events for about eight years now,” said Library Assistant Director Scott Stanton. “We get some great bands and artists here.”</p>

<p>Stanton, who books the musical acts for the monthly coffee house, first saw Big Deal Rock play at a competition in East Hartford. Thursday was the band’s second appearance at the Bristol Public Library. Stanton originally booked the band in 2020, but the gig was delayed to 2021 due to Covid precautions.</p>

<p>Big Deal Rock were so well liked by guests during their 2021 Library Coffee House, that Library Director Debbie Prozzo wanted them to return for a second consecutive year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They were really popular, so we wanted to bring them back,” said Prozzo. “They’re high-energy, and we wanted to end summer reading on a high note.”</p>

<p>Big Deal Rock are a 4-piece ensemble of highly accomplished musicians playing songs from the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Covers of Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl,” Chicago’s “Saturday in the Park” and Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” were just a few of the classic rock songs covered by the band.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve been playing around New England for 30 years,” said Stanton. “They’ve played with groups like NRBQ, Cheap Trick, the Doobie Brothers, and they always bring the rock.”</p>

<p>The nonprofit organization The Friends of the Bristol Public Library provided hospitality for the Library Coffee House event. Volunteers handed out concessions for guests to enjoy during the show, and goody bags were handed out after the last song. Before the final song of the night, several beautifully assembled baskets were raffled off to the guests.</p>
