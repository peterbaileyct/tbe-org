<p>The annual Thanksgiving Day battles between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern started to even out a bit when the 1990’s came about. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Dave Moore helped the Rams earn some early decade success while Reinaldo Soto eventually turned the tide in 1996 - leading to a three game series of misery for Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, when the 21st century came calling, Central’s Timmy Washington stared to turn the tide.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto and Washington are simply the two greatest running backs in Bristol scholastic history - making the decade of the 1990s exciting between the programs.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what happened during the 1990s between Central and Eastern:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Year – Winner, Score&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1990 – Bristol Central, 34-14:</strong>&nbsp;Central’s defense limited Eastern to just 24 yards on the ground during the 20-point victory. In fact, the Rams held the Lancers to just 148 total yards of offense on the day as Central won for the second straight time on Thanksgiving.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1991 – Bristol Central, 20-14:</strong>&nbsp;The Lancers, going a credible 4-6-1 on the campaign, dropped a hard fought six-point game. Central’s Dave Moore scooped up 82 yards on 17 carries, but the Rams had to hold on for dear life. But that game-winning score from the Lancers never materialized. Eastern quarterback, sophomore Jude Hinrichs, was sacked a half dozen times in the game but battled to the end.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1992 – Bristol Central, 24-0:</strong>&nbsp;Winless Eastern was no match for Central as Micah Zabel collected 237 yards on 25 carries, scoring three touchdowns. In all, the Rams totaled 375 yards of offense over what would be the first of two consecutive shutouts. In fact, over the next three Central wins against Eastern, those showdowns would all come via shutout.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1993 – Bristol Central, 18-0:</strong>&nbsp;The Rams took the T-Day game as Gregg Lynt, Dana Thurston and John Gagliardi combined for over 200 yards on 49 carries to lead Central to the win.&nbsp;Eastern ended the campaign losing seven straight contests. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1994 – Bristol Eastern, 22-6:</strong>&nbsp;For the first time since 1988, Eastern defeated Central on Thanksgiving. Crafty Rich Musumano made 18 carries for 141 yards to lead the Lancers. Central’s John Gagliardi (26 carries, 202 yards) sparked the offense for the Rams. The squads combined for five passing yards in what turned into a real ground battle.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1995 – Bristol Central, 12-0:</strong>&nbsp;Central’s Doug Boelter had both touchdowns in the game and 76 yards on 17 rushes to lead his team to the win. Freshman Reinaldo Soto scooped in an interception for Eastern – a sign of things to come for the Eastern program and the ultra-talented Soto.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1996 – Bristol Eastern, 29-14:</strong>&nbsp;With Soto in the fold, he smashed Central for 183 yards on 32 carries while adding three touchdowns over the winning effort. In the victorious effort, Eastern earned a share of the CCC South Championship. The Rams lost six fumbles – the most ever on Thanksgiving.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1997 – Bristol Eastern, 33-7:</strong>&nbsp;It was more Soto, along with quarterback Pat Brookman, as the duo rushed a combined 30 times for 215 yards in another Eastern romp. Central’s Craig Capurso scooped up 115 yards on 25 rushes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1998 – Bristol Eastern, 35-7:</strong>&nbsp;This time, Brookman blitzed Central for 134 yards on seven carries and a touchdown while Soto went for 137 yards on 20 rushes for the win. The game was third straight Lancers’ blowout on Thanksgiving. Eastern’s Ryan Forcier added nearly 100 yards on six carries. Lost in the effort was the rushing of Capurso (29 carries for 183 yards).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1999 – Bristol Central, 28-6:</strong>&nbsp;Bulldog Timmy Washington made 41 carries for 165 yards and three touchdowns to lead Central. Washington rushed for nearly 2,000 yards on the season, soon to be the state leader in rushes. The Rams won the first of seven straight Thanksgiving Day games. </p>
