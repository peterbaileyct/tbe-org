<p>Pokémon, a Japanese media franchise, includes video games, animated series, films, and a trading card game. The franchise, which began in the 1990s, became a global phenomenon and remains a cultural staple today.</p>

<p>“I will be making vanilla sugar cookies with a vanilla icing, Kepler said. “They will have images of various Pokémon for the children to paint. I have always been excited to participate in events for children and aim to bring my paint your own cookies to more events giving children the opportunity to be creative while enjoying a treat at the same time.”</p>
