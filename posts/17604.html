<p>In addition, she earned certification as a Hospital Chaplain from the National Catholic Chaplains Association and the National Chaplains Association. Having taught in Catholic elementary schools throughout Connecticut for 18 years, Sr. Dolores was recognized as a person who cared deeply for her students and listened carefully to what they were saying. </p>

<p>These skills she transferred to her ministry as a chaplain. Centering her chaplaincy at Bristol Hospital, Sr. Dolores recognized the value of her listening presence for both patients and their loved ones, representing both hope and strength and bringing them comfort and joy. In her personal assessment of her chaplaincy, Sr. Dolores has cited the deeper awareness she gained of her own humanity which enabled her to understand and appreciate others more fully.</p>

<p>On the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of being a Sister of Mercy, Gov. Rowland issued a proclamation making Sept. 14, 2003, as SISTER DOLORES BESHARA DAY in the State of Connecticut.  The proclamation recognized her ministries as an educator and chaplain and the programs and services she brought to the communities she served.</p>
