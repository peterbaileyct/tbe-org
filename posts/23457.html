<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have been making plans for a grandchild’s birthday party later in the day. It’s one of those fun times, something to look forward to. The 3-year-old has chosen a volcano theme. What will that look like?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These little gatherings, at least for me, are a reminder that while there are plenty of things to be concerned about, if we look around us and stop to consider what is actually happening in our immediate lives, we might see that things are okay--even good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start there and then, take one more step, and consider that these events are what most people want for themselves and their families. In other words, we have more in common with each other than not, despite  being overwhelmed with information to the contrary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Helping people to step into this space is something of particular interest to me. It is what we here at TBE are attempting to do with our online newspaper. We need a place that helps us remember who we are and what we have going for us, both as individuals and families, but also as a community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a good problems, and one us TBEer’s really take to heart. We meet weekly for this purpose. What is newsworthy? What should the focus be? In other words, how to report it? Again, you can help by sending ideas for coverage, thoughts on what we have covered, specific angles to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank">editor@bristoledition.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also you would be amazed that people are still unaware of us, and how others think we are part of the Bristol Press. Anything you can do to help spread the news about TBE and correct misconceptions is greatly appreciated. Even better support us with a small recurring donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening/reading -- for listening, I keep returning to the “Learning How to See” podcast. It is one of several from the Center for Action and Contemplation, founded in 1987 by Franciscan Richard Rohr as “an educational nonprofit introducing seekers to the contemplative Christian path of transformation.”&nbsp;For some people, it might be a little too much, but I figured, what the heck. Put it out there and see what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why this particular podcast? It deals with biases of all sorts, thus the title, “Learning How To See.” Each individual podcast in Season 2, discusses two or three different biases. I think there are 12 or so, which takes an entire season to get through. For Season 2 of “Learning How to See,” click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cac.org/podcast/learning-how-to-see/?season=lhts-two#season-details" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>The most recent On the Media podcast featured two segments that caught my attention. The first,“The History of Free Market Fundamentalism in the US,” addresses a favorite new subject, capitalism. When unfettered profit becomes the goal, what happens to society? For the segment, click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/history-free-market-fundamentalism-on-the-media" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second segment, “The Communist Manifesto Through the Ages,” sure gets some attention. Just mention communism in any context and things get strange. Click <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/communist-manifesto-through-ages-on-the-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for the segment, and buckle up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie’s column, “Marjorie Taylor Green Has a Dream,” takes an interesting turn when it introduces James Madison’s stance on how the electorate might manage itself when it comes to resolving differences between factions. A link to Madison’s letter on the subject is provided. The reading is tough but illuminating.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
