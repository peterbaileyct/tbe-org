<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week against E.O. Smith, the Bristol Eastern football team let opportunity slip away, fumbling and bumbling the ball, penalized for numerous infractions and allowed the Panthers additional possessions -- culminating in a frustrating 24-14 loss on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one week later, the Lancers fixed those miscues, took Avon to task and 48 minutes later, the Kingstreeters were big 48-8 winners from Alumni Field in Bristol on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final contest for Eastern’ senior core from Alumni Field, the program put together a tremendous effort that will fuel the team into the Thanksgiving break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a long talk on Monday after our game on Friday [against E.O. Smith] where we felt we didn’t have our best” effort said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “We talked about holding ourselves to a higher standard, not just on Friday nights but Monday through Thursday as well in practice. We had a much more focused effort in practice and I’m really proud of the way we played tonight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 48 points were the most scored by Eastern since dumping 54 against Farmington back on Nov. 12, 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 6-3 on the campaign, the most wins in a season for the team since the 2014 campaign when the program went 7-4 -- its first year that the Kingstreeters played all of their home games from the high school instead of Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>History was made against Avon as Eastern senior running back Jaiden Fore became the latest 1,000-yard rusher for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He cashed in on 183 yards on 16 carries for four touchdowns -- doing all his damage over first half play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On his final carry of Eastern’s second drive, a 19 yard TD scamper, Fore nabbed his 1,000th yard on the play and now has 1,147 yards on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was just like another game with my boys,” said Fore of the accomplishment. “It’s our last time on this field [and] I’ve got to put it all out there, nothing else to it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, including a sterling effort by Nelson Riley (career-high five carries, 133 yards, touchdown), the squad wrangled up 368 total yards in offense.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That effort included a terrific 45-yard touchdown pass by Eastern quarterback Kamden Laprise to receiver Mikey Sherrill for a huge second quarter score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kicker Aiden Liseo went 6-of-7 on PAT’s and is 10-for-12 overall this season on his one-point attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there were stars all over the gridiron for the Lancers on defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam and Ryan Zavecz got their usual quota of tackles, Chase Dauphinee cashed in on a fumble recovery for a touchdown while Sherill tallied a strip and a sack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tackles for losses were also compiled by Hunter Wells, Lincoln Bashaw, J’Kai Hickey-Davis and a couple from King Stewart -- seeing more time on the gridiron as of late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons were held to just 149 yards in total offense, leading to one score -- an eight-yard TD rush by Nik Meltser -- but not much else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Avon, despite its record, is really competitive with a lot of teams,” said Julius. “They churn it up on offense and they’re very physical. The coach does a great job over there. For us to hold that offensive in check and force them into long yardage situations, it was really good to see.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once the score reached 48-8 with 10:56 left to play in the third quarter, the contest moved into running time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored three times over first-period play to snare a sizable 20-0 advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Avon’s first drive of the game, Sherill made a slick strip on a John Murphy carry and Dauphinee scooped up the ball --rumbling 31 yards into the end zone as Eastern took a 7-0 edge just 1:35 into the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons then went three-and-out as Eastern took over on Avon’s 46-yard line via punt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that ensuing drive, it was all Fore -- making three huge rushes, capping on a 19-yard touchdown carry for his 1,000th yard as the Lancers collected a 14-0 lead with 6:44 to go in the first period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The offensive line played great,” said Julius. “Jaiden was outstanding, obviously, in the first half.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons followed up with a four-and-out while a six-play Eastern drive ended with a three-yard touchdown jaunt by Fore and with 1:14 remaining in the first period, the home team roped up a 20-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second period, Avon was forced into a quick punt and on the flip side, Laprise made a sweet seeing-eye pass to Sherrill as the big man roped in a reception, eluding the contact, for a 45-yard TD and a 27-0 Eastern lead with 11:35 left to play in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We didn’t have to throw the ball very much but Kam [Laprise] was obviously very efficient, bought time and hit a long pass to Mikey [Sherrill]. I’m happy for them as well, too,” said Julius.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another Avon turnover led to an 11-yard score by Fore and with 7:14 to play in the second stanza, Eastern’s edge reached 34-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons finally scored on a 10-play drive, encompassing 55 yards as Nik Meltser (13 carries, 53 yards) ran into the Eastern goal for an eight-yard touchdown and with 55 seconds left before the half, Avon trimmed the deficit to 34-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forty-four seconds later, Eastern used a couple timeouts to set up Fore for one final touchdown as he scampered into the end zone on an eight-yard jaunt -- his fourth and final TD of the night -- to propel the Kingstreeters to a 41-8 halftime cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers then put the event away off the first play of the third period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bashaw made a quick rush to open the half and then Riley went wild on a huge 64 yard, shake-and-bake explosion -- leaving the defense in the dust -- as he scampered in for his second touchdown of the year, propelling the Lancers to a 48-8 lead with 10:57 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Riley score activated running time for the remainder of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons ended up empty on its final two possessions, leading to Eastern’s big 40-point win with its game against Bristol Central looming in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a good team win for us,” said Julius. “We played better on special teams this week. That was a lot of points of emphasis for us so I’m happy we came out and played well.”</p>
