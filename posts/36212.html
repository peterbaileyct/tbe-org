<p>"Trunk or Treat" was the call Wednesday evening at Village Green where families of residents filled the parking lot with vehicles decorated for Halloween to entertain and filled with baskets of treats to hand out to neighborhood children.</p>

<p>"The cars line up along the street," said one mom. "It's fun."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's quiet now," her son Jacob said, "but things pick up when there are more people."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kids, Kade and Jacob, were decked out in costumes. They were joined by two figures, one pumpkin-headed seated in the back of the family SUV and the other standing alongside.</p>

<p>Village Green, a middle-sized nursing home, has sponsored the event for the past few years. Many residents also participate in the evening's activities. </p>

<p>Incidentally, earlier in the day a black bear was spotted in the area behind the nursing home, which caused a stir.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
