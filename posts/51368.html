<p>The Board of Education Finance and Operations Committee, announced that the general fund was 3.1% over budget with negative $3,734,869 left in the account.</p>

<p>The total budget for the year 2024 was $113,300,943.08 but the committee members said most of the money went to special education costs. A total of $364,689.83 of open costs are still open.</p>

<p>“I’m forecasting the balance at the end of the fiscal period will be approximately $3.6 million over budget,” said one of the committee members.</p>

<p>The committee said that this leaves little room in the budget for the 2025 school year.</p>

<p>“To me this is not a gap that is shrinking, this is a gap that is growing,” said a committee member. “And if the city is unwilling to cover this or there are issues around this, my concern is that we’ll be asked to then draw down on other expense lines. And that means realistically that drawdown comes from a place of people’s employment.”</p>

<p>In other news, the committee said $501,404 in salaries was moved, $15 thousand was moved from maintenance supplies security to equipment security and $39,949.83 was moved from repairs and maintenance technology to district-wide software lines in the budget.</p>
