<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team lost to Lewis Mills on Saturday at the Clement J. Roy Field, losing 5-2 and dropping their season record to 3-7.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers received excellent pitching&nbsp;from Jonny Montgomery, collected nine hits on the day, but again saw faulty defense and the lack of timely hitting hurting their chances.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery allowed just two earned runs in the loss, with Declan Schenck coming on in relief in the seventh to record the final two outs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern took a quick 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first, after Mongomery retired Mills in order in the top of the inning on just four pitches. &nbsp;In the Eastern half of the inning, Gabe White opened with an infield single to deep short, stole second, and scored on Noah Molinsky’s double to left. &nbsp;A wild pitch moved Molinsky to third, and he scored on Ben D’Amato’s groundout to second.</p>

<p>Mills scored an unearned run in the third, scoring on a wild pitch, and then tied the game at 2-2 in the fourth&nbsp;when a walk, followed by singles from Brett Harding and Matt Micari loaded the bases, and the run&nbsp;then&nbsp;scored on a Connor Crosbie infield single, a slow roller to short.</p>

<p>Mills took the lead in the top of the sixth. Harding singled to left, his third hit of the game, went to second on an&nbsp;error on a pickoff attempt, went to third on an outfield error, and scored on a groundout. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills scored their final two runs in the seventh on a single, and an rbi double to left by Matt Chirumbolo. Chirumbolo later scored on another&nbsp;Lancer&nbsp;infield error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, meanwhile, threatened throughout, leaving 12 runners on base over the final six innings. &nbsp;Mills made all the plays defensively, getting strong defensive plays from the left side of their infield,&nbsp;and&nbsp;solid outfield play, including an excellent diving catch of a line drive&nbsp;to&nbsp;right center off the bat of D’Amato with two runners on and two outs in the sixth.</p>

<p>For Eastern, White and Owen Myers each collected two hits.</p>
