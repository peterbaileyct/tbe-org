<p>The website for BRXSTOL, an immersive storytelling project featuring Bristol's clockmaking history, clues to unraveling a mystery and podcasts, has been updated, according to its creator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol native C.T. O'Brien, the person behind the project, said he has added to the website a video of the live presentation, which occurred earlier this year at the Bristol Public Library. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most recent program at the Bristol Public Library attracted two dozen people who have been following the saga since it began last year. The initial event kicked off just after Thanksgiving with a presentation at the Bristol Historical Society.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the video, the website now includes a time lime of events that will be coming later this year and into 2025. Click <a href="https://www.brxstol.com/home">here</a> for the website. Follow the "Clue" tab for specifics about the mystery. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The website includes a trailer explaining the premise and a podcast with several episodes laying out the story and introducing the characters, including historical figures prominent in Bristol history, such as John Birge and Joseph Ives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three episodes of the podcasts, two of which have to do with an offer binding Ives and Birge and one of which has to do with a secret that may help solve the mystery.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
