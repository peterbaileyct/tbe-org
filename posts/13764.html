<p>In a recent press release, the Main Street Community Foundation has announced that they once again have achieved accreditation from The National Standards for U.S. Community Foundations program, the nation’s highest standard for philanthropic excellence, accountability, and distinction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The National Standards for U.S. Community Foundations is a rigorous process that ensures accountability and transparency.&nbsp;There are 700 community foundations nationwide, and of those, 500 have achieved this accreditation.&nbsp;As the National Standards accreditation program is made by and for community foundations, the process is peer-driven and self-regulatory.&nbsp;It&nbsp;involves the review of documentation that proves how each&nbsp;community foundation meets the&nbsp;standards, including how the foundation honors the charitable intentions of its donors and identifies and addresses community opportunities and needs.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MSCF has been continually in compliance with these national standards since its first accreditation in&nbsp;2006,&nbsp;and will remain accredited until its renewal in 2025.&nbsp;While there are federal and state laws that all community foundations must adhere to, this voluntary accreditation process demonstrates&nbsp;MSCF’s&nbsp;willingness to go above and beyond those requirements and illustrates its dedication to excellence and to the communities it serves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Main Street Community Foundation was founded by a group of community leaders&nbsp;in 1995&nbsp;and their work&nbsp;hascontinued&nbsp;27&nbsp;years&nbsp;later&nbsp;through gift planning, stewardship of assets, grantmaking and community leadership. MSCF&nbsp;offers a range of charitable funds, allowing donors to advance a cause, support an individual organization, provide flexible support for community needs or recommend individual grants.&nbsp;In addition to affirming the organization’s philanthropic services, the accreditation validates Main Street Community Foundation’s grantmaking practices for the nonprofit&nbsp;community.</p>
