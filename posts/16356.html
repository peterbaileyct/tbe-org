<p>A subgenre of science fiction or fantasy, Steampunk has created a subculture all its own, focusing on technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Steampunk has festivals, conventions, art projects, fashion and music. Characteristics include gears, goggles, gauges, top hats, and corsets (always worn on the outside).</p>

<p>Participation is free and open to the public. Attendees are encouraged to bring a blanket and folding chairs for this Victorian-style picnic.</p>
