<p>Come Sunday morning, the couple from Australia, youngest son and partner Allison, will have been here for a week. Every morning that they have been here they have joined us on the porch for tea at 7:30 a.m. When I say been here, I mean when they haven’t been visiting family and friends. For instance, three days ago they were visiting Allison’s family, so Mary and I were on the porch ourselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s a wonderful way to start any day, and especially fun to hear how things are different in another country. For instance, workers get a living wage, minimums are in the $25-$35 hourly range, and if a person works beyond their regular work hours or weekends, a surcharge is charged and added to their regular wages. Health care is covered.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course Australians get five weeks for vacation, and no one is expected not to take their time. In other words, no one day here or there—it is a vacation, meaning a month away. Something to think about.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the company where Allison works has its roots in the states, it is an international company that is experimenting with a four-day work week. It’s more than an interesting prospect. Workers have the ability to choose how to break up their weeks—take a Friday or break things up with a Wednesday, it’s up to the person. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Around town, the Bristol Parks Recreation Youth and Community services has opened its online portal for people to vote on two designs being proposed for the new children’s playground at Seymour Park off Riley Road. This has become a regular, and welcomed, step for the BRRYCS as it considers improvements to Bristol’s wonderful parks. Click <a href="https://bprycs-project-portal.constantcontactsites.com/upgrade-your-play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and follow the tabs to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading/listening--I took a deep dive this week with Lex Fridman and his #387 podcast entitled “George Hotz: Tiny Corp, Twitter, A. Safety, Self-Driving, GPT, AGI &amp; God.” Hotz is a programmer (Elon Musk turned to him recently to help re-form Twitter), hacker (a wunderkind of sorts who hacked iOS—the first to remove the SIM card from the iphone--and reverse engineered Sony PlayStation 3), and the founder of comma-ai and tiny corp (companies that are behind self-driving car tech and set their sites on deep neural learning frameworks coupled with the creation of machines that decentralize tech by providing people with machines with enormous specs, respectively).&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is all a lot to take in. Listening to the podcast, around three hours, time stolen from each day while driving or exercising, is an otherworldly experience. Covered? A.I. girlfriends along with the existence of God. Fridman is a MIT researcher, so his podcasts do get technical—don’t plan to understand everything—but hang in there long enough and you will understand more. Among his recent interviews is one with Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For reading, I have to recommend another column by Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times. The column is entitled “No One Can Stop Talking About Justice John Marshall Harlan.” Bouie does something that few people manage—rather than starting with second stories, he starts with firsts. For an idea of what I mean here, try this on, by reference to a familiar scenario. It’s a basketball game, the first player takes a cheap shot at another and the second retaliates. Who does the referee call for the foul? The second player.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this instance, Bouie identifies Harlan as the originator of a favorite quote from a court case that is used to promote an equal playing field, a colorblind one. This time around it is used as a fulcrum for the recent affirmative action case. What Bouie does is take his readers back to the sentences that precede this quote to unveil Harlan’s deep segregationist, white supremacist grounding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
