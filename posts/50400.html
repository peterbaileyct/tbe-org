<p>Both teams traded advances into each other's side , but couldn't get into the final third for the first fifteen minutes.&nbsp;Then the Lancers began to move the ball to the flanks where they found success.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Landon Gawel broke up a Windsor cross and hit the ball to Alex Szynal who sent a pass down the left wing.&nbsp; Eli Emmert collected it, beat a man, and sent the ball across to the opposite side where Cabrera didn't hesitate and hit a hard shot past&nbsp; Windsor goalie Owen&nbsp; Antonie at 20:00.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Our defense was challenged, especially at the end of each half, but it got the job done, "said Lancer coach Bill Sweet. "Connor Murtaugh in goal was steady, while Drew Viens and John Saraceno, who guarded Windsor's dangerous player, Nigel Martin, played extremely well in the back."</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second half was even as both sides had shots, but they either went wide or the goalies made the save.&nbsp; &nbsp;Antonie ended up with five saves for Windsor, while Murtaugh had seven for BE. </p>
