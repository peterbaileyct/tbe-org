<p>A Bristol family was among those honored by Wheeler for outstanding support of its mission at the organization’s 13th Annual Hands &amp; Hearts event, held virtually, on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the past four years during the holiday season, Joe and Toni Frady of Bristol have provided items for Wheeler families in need. Their acts of kindness and generosity reflect their deeply held core values and serve as teachable moments for members of their own family, the release from Wheeler states. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their gifts have addressed the needs of dozens of Wheeler patients, spanning seven programs, including Community Support for Families, Care Coordination, Multisystemic Therapy – Building Stronger Families, Child First, Intensive Family Preservation, Supportive Housing, and Youth and Family TREE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This annual event recognizes individuals and families, corporations, and foundations for helping Wheeler to provide equitable access to innovative care that improves health, recovery, and growth at all stages of life. Wheeler has recognized more than 85 philanthropists since the inception of this event.</p>

<p>The other recipients include the following:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eversource Energy for a collaboration this year that supported the purchase of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system for Wheeler’s new community health center at One Hope Street, through the Connecticut Neighborhood Assistance Act Tax Credit Program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, this summer, the Eversource Energy Foundation awarded a $2,500 community impact grant to help support Wheeler’s Walk With Me service line for LGBTQIA+ individuals through its Family Health &amp; Wellness Center in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Friends and Family of Sam Marszycki for The Samuel Marszycki Scholarship that supports a graduating senior with post-secondary education. It is named in honor of a former paraprofessional at Northwest Village School (NVS) who passed away in June 2020.\</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Established by family and friends in 2021 in Marszycki’s memory, the scholarship supported through donations and the annual Sam-O Scramble Golf Tournament, which marked its third anniversary this past September. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first award in 2021 helped support a graduating NVS senior who went on to study at a local community college. In 2022, the scholarship supported a graduating senior who wished to attend culinary school. The 2023 recipient aims to attend veterinary school.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Francis Vincent (West Hartford, Connecticut) who for the past decade served in key leadership roles on Wheeler’s Board of Trustees, including vice-chair and chair of the Development Committee. Under his direction and vision, Wheeler established its first capital campaign in decades, set an ambitious goal, and then expanded it, beating it convincingly and ahead of schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vincent's hard work, drive, and generosity—including a significant leadership gift—were instrumental in Wheeler’s community center at One Hope Street becoming a reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Rachel Tressy and Voya Financial who as a result of Tressy's fundraising efforts, which involved more than 100 colleagues, collectively, raised more than $10,000 towards services at Wheeler in Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
