<p>BRISTOL – It was just a matter of time before the bats for the Bristol Eastern baseball team were going to spring to life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s what happened on Wednesday afternoon as the Lancers pounded Conard offensively, leading to a 7-0 victory from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (2-2 overall) zipped up a season-high 11 hits in its demolition against the Red Wolves (3-5) in a CCC interdivisional showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rio Fernandez collected three hits (two doubles) for the Kingstreeters while also scoring two runs and nabbing an RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D'Amato added two hits (double and single), driving in four runs, while Connor&nbsp;Cyr posted two base hits over the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the contest wasn’t just about the offense explosion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern pitcher Ryan Maglio was simply sensational against the Red Wolves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He pitched the first six innings, allowing just two singles, struck out 11 while walking five to snare the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Gatti pitched the seventh stanza for the Lancers to help preserve the three-hit shutout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Wolves attempted to put together a two-out rally in the first inning as Maglio gave up an infield single to Jack Kane.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After walking the bases full, Maglio tallied a huge strikeout to end the threat while on the flip side, Eastern pounced on Conard for a couple runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr opened the stanza with a single to left,&nbsp;Owen Myers reached on an error and a throwing miscue put the runners on second and third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato then doubled to left, clearing the bases, as the home team held a two-run edge through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers weren’t finished as the squad scored an additional three runs in the bottom of the second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez smacked a double over the centerfielder's head to start things off while Mason Harris earned a base on balls to put two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone, Myers hit a ball up the middle – with it hitting off the pitcher towards shortstop with no play – to juice the bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez scored on a wild pitch and D'Amato's singled to center, sending Harris and Myers home, to make it a 5-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third, Caleb Molinsky opened the inning with a single to right, swiped second, and tagged the dish on Fernandez's double to left center, making the contest a 6-0 affair through three.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless fourth in which Maglio fanned the entire side, the Kingstreeters were back at it again in the fifth to snare the final run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez singled to left and when Harris followed with an infield single, runners were on first and second.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Schenck sacrificed the duo into scoring position, and Cyr's pop-fly single to right scored Fernandez as Eastern held an imposing 7-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard threatened in the sixth but the attempted rally did not produce a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A leadoff walk and a two-out single up the middle by Ben Lemieux put two runners on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, one final strikeout by Maglio kept the shutout intact and Gatti pitched a scoreless seventh to ice the game as Eastern moved to .500 over the 7-0 victory against Conard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>It was the 36<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;all-time showdown between the programs as Conard carries a slim 19-17 edge in series play…It was Eastern head coach’s Steve Gaudet first ever game against the Red Wolves…The Lancers are back in the thick of things today at Rocky Hill in a CCC interdivisional bout at 3:45 p.m. and then squares off against Newington (Friday, 3:45 p.m.) on the road.&nbsp;</p>
