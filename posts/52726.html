<p>Trick-or-treating, face painting food trucks and coffin races are coming to Memorial Boo-levard this Saturday for the second annual Halloween Spooktacular.</p>

<p>“I think families will love the trick-or-treating aspect of it,” Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said, “along with all the activities for kids. Adults will like the options of movies, food and drinks available, and every age will be able to enjoy getting into the spirit and dressing up for Halloween.”</p>

<p>The Halloween Spooktacular will be held from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School open field at 70 Memorial Boulevard. The festival debuted last year, attracting over 4,000 visitors. This year, attendees can expect a “roaming railroad” train, a Haunted Spirits Brew Tent, local vendors, a D.J. and the highly anticipated coffin races. Admission to the event is free.</p>

<p>“I am most excited for the coffin race,” Therriault said. “It’s our first year ever of doing it, and I think it’s going to grow into something fun and silly for years to come. Coffins will be on display near the entrance of the event. Beginning at 5 p.m., folks who signed up will race their coffins, two at a time.&nbsp; This will be timed, and the winner receives tickets to any Downtown Live event for the upcoming season.”</p>
