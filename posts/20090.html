<p>Come Sunday morning, the family is planning an outing to Tonn’s Marketplace where Smetana, the food truck featuring Eastern European fare run by Bristolite Nick Valenta, will be hunkered down as what we anticipate as a cold cold day. When the plans were hatched earlier in September the weather was still in the 70s. It doesn’t look like it this time around, but we are excited to get together, do some shopping at Tonn’s and try some decidedly delicious food.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you haven’t been by, Tonn’s is a treat in itself. The marketplace features local agricultural products from area farms and businesses. Bakery on Maple and Harvest items are on sale as well as items from Lyman Orchard. And there are a bunch of other unique products from chocolates to food to hot sauce and tomato sauces. Smetana makes fairly regular stops, so it makes sense to check ahead online to confirm. </p>

<p><em>Smetana</em> is Polish for cream, as in sour cream, but a Rocky Hill High School colleague and native Bristolite Dan Czuchta tells me, <em>Smetana</em> also has other meanings along the lines of "the cream that rises to the top." </p>

<p>Friday night Mary and I attended the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame induction dinner at Doubletree. Ed Swicklas was honored with the Julie Larese Award, typically given at the Bristol Tramps dinner, but given this evening since the two organizations have merged under the hall of fame. Other honorees included Chris Strahowski, Kim Corbin Varasconi, Tracy Pomerenke Regan, Reinaldo Soto, Leon and Gussie Breen, Mario Marrero, Clem Roy and Pete Wininger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s always a feel-good evening, one where you can sit back and relax, chat with some old and new friends both before the meal and during the meal. Zingers: Former Bristol Central coach and athletic director Bob DeSantis took a few hits, one right from the get-go when BSHoF president Mark Ziogas said he didn’t realize DeSantis was involved in politics and congratulated him for winning the governorship in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
