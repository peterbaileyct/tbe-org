<p>Bristol Eastern did not bring their “A game” with them to South Windsor Friday night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers played a rather poor first half, trailing 29-18 at intermission.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, to start the third quarter, Eastern went on a 10-0 run, and at the 4:49 mark, closed to 29-28. From that point to the end, the contest stayed relatively close.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 4:14 mark of the third quarter, Lukas Sward picked up his fourth foul, and was forced to sit for the rest of the quarter. Eastern trailed by one, 35-34, after three periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the fourth South Windsor's London King (game high scorer with 27 points), hit a two and consecutive three's for an 8-0 run, and at the 4:00 minute mark, South Windsor led by nine, 43-34.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a 45-36 count, the Lancers get a 3 from Jordan Chisholm (six three's on the night), a basket by Zaveyn Tate, and two foul shots by  Brayden Dauphinais, and cut the deficit to 45-43 with a minute to go.&nbsp; <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 12.9 seconds left, Eastern, down by four, wanted to intentionally foul, and Naseem Walker fouled&nbsp; King on an inbounds play, Eastern's fifth foul of the quarter. But South Windsor had six players on the court, and was called for a technical.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After several minutes and much discussion, South Windsor was awarded two foul shots, converted by King, making the score 49-43.&nbsp; <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chisholm made the two technical foul shots, and with the score now at 49-45,  Sward was fouled on a three point attempt and made the first two (49-47), but missed the third which was rebounded by&nbsp;BE’s Brady Bell. Bell missed his attempted put-back, Eastern fouled  again, and South Windsor’s Ethan Burke converted both for the final score of 51-47.</p>

<p>"We played badly in every aspect of the game and still had a chance&nbsp;to win," Eastern coach Bunty Ray said. "I told the kids what to expect: a hungry team on senior night, needs [a win] to make the tournament. We didn't match their intensity. That's the bottom line."</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The ruling on the floor: Six men on the court</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the ball was inbounded, Eastern immediately fouled and it was quickly discovered that the Bobcats had six players on the court - causing a technical foul.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, since Eastern's fifth foul came BEFORE the refs caught the six men, it could not be rescinded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one had ever seen such a strange ending to a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 14-4 and returns to action right away with a 5:00 home game today vs. E.O. Smith, a make-up for the game snowed out on Tuesday.</p>
