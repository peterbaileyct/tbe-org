<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scholastic playoff field is set as all the regular season results and points have been tabulated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on November 30, all four divisions will play quarterfinal games around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, 16 games are on the docket for this Tuesday - with all showdowns commencing at 6:30 p.m. at the site of the higher seed (unless lights are not available for the contest).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teams with undefeated records all the way down to three losses made up the tournament field though some programs with 8-2 ledgers were shutout of postseason play entirely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Class LL, West Haven (8-2) did not qualify for the playoffs this season despite an excellent campaign while over in Class L, three programs with just two losses failed to make the state tournament in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fitch, along with Quinebaug Valley and Thames River, were denied postseason slots in the Class L mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along those lines, five teams were able to qualify for the playoffs with three losses apiece as Greenwich qualified in Class LL while Daniel Hand slipped into the Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Class M saw the grouping of Granby/Canton earn the third seed despite a 7-3 record (one of their coaches on Thanksgiving told me that after a loss this season, Granby/Canton actually <em>moved up </em>in the CIAC rankings that evening…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington and Ellington each had three losses on the year and will be playing on Tuesday as well in the Class M bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 8 Gilbert/Northwest/Housatonic played just eight games - the minimum for state tournament qualification - going 6-2 along the way to qualify for the Class M fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in an interesting note, both of the state’s 10-0 teams came from Class S with top ranked Bloomfield and the co-op of Cromwell/Portland going undefeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over in Class L, Bristol Central - going back to the playoffs for a Bristol public school record third time - has the best record of all the sixth ranked teams this year at 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamden (8-2, Class LL), Torrington (7-3, Class M), and Seymour (8-2, Class S) all have more losses in the sixth position than Central does.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney is certainly going to have its collective hands full on Tuesday night with the Rams in town as Central is looking for its first postseason win in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
