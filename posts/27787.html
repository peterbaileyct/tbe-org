<p>What more could be said about the scholastic careers of Bristol Central seniors Frankie Porrini and Tre Blair?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo has seemingly done it all for the running programs at the school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And each athlete has left a legacy that will last far beyond the campus at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Porrini is a long distance phenom</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini is as talented a runner as any who has competed at Central under long time coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior establishing numerous school records over all three of his running seasons at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From winning the Bristol city series cross country meet several times to his All-American status in the 2k steeplechase, Porrini has been a prime-time performer for the Rams over his four seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when a reporter told Porrini he makes it look all too easy on the track, the senior shot back that “it’s not.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effort the long-distance runner has put into his craft has paid off several times over and will so again at the collegiate level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Blair is a dual state champion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair has been honored for his athlete abilities in football, boys basketball and track and field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tremendous athlete is a state champion in the triple jump and helped the hoops squad win the 2021-22 Class L title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His leaps in the long and triple allowed the performer a chance to shine at the state, New England and National levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s an amazing ledger for any scholastic athlete to strive for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both athletes established several records at BCHS and the duo will compete in different sports at the NCAA level in the fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what the two accomplished just over the spring scholastic campaign is certainly worthy of another look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Porrini and Blair ruled at the CCC, Class L and the State Open championships</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the spring scholastic campaign, Porrini and Blair led the Central’s boys track and field program to a stellar 14-0 record I what could have termed as a rebuilding year for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory at the 2023 CCC South Championship was a great way to open the postseason while the program tied for fourth place at the Class L championship showcase on May 31.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair won the Class L long jump with a leap of 22 feet, 2.25 inches and then absolutely crushed it in the triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His leap of 46 feet, 2.50 inches won him another individual state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Porrini punched his ticket to the State Open on June 5 with a fifth-place finish in the 1600 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 4:19.59 was an excellent finish at the Open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Open event from Willow Brook Park in New Britain saw more of the same for the Blair/Porrini combination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini finished the 1600 meters in fourth place with a time of 4:16.53 - a personal record - while Blair out-jumped the competition with a winning triple jump make of 46 feet, 11 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That jump broke his own school record as the seniors moved on to the New England's in Bangor, Maine less than a week later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>New England’s were a complete success</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 76th New England Interscholastic Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championships, Porrini and Blair made huge showings in Bangor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair finished the triple jump in third place, squaring away a leap of 44 feet, 10.5 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was the best finisher from the state of Connecticut and that leap punched his ticket to the 2023 New Balance Outdoor Nationals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 1600, Porrini placed fifth with a stellar time of 4:15.33, snaring All New England honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned the right to battle the best of the best in the 2k steeplechase at the Nationals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The premier event commenced from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as Porrini and Blair had another amazing weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In part two of the story, Stafford-Kirk talks about the tremendous accomplishments by Porrini and Blair from the National Track and Field event in Philadelphia.</p>
