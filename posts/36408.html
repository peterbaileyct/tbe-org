<p>More than 50 people gathered outside the History Room at the Bristol Public Library for the dedication of a display in memory of local Vietnam veterans, 17 from Bristol who lost their lives in the war, and to honor former post commander and Bristol mayor the late Art Ward on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The display case housed items left at the Traveling Vietnam Wall, "The Wall That Heals” when it left Bristol in 2016. American Legion, Post 2, took charge of the items and has been working on making a forever home for them. In September 2022 the Vietnam veterans were named HomeTown Heroes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event happened thanks to the work of the Bristol Public Library 50th Vietnam War Commemoration Committee, The Friends of the Library and the American Legion, Post 2 “Seicheprey.” All funding for the display case and the plaque were raised from donations. No Library, Federal or American Legion money was used.</p>

<p>The second part of the ceremony was to recall and honor Ward, the former Post 2 commander and mayor who was a Vietnam veteran who cared greatly for all veterans.</p>

<p>Scott Stanton, from the Bristol Library, began the ceremony. Pat Ward, wife of the honoree, led all in the Pledge of Allegiance.  CSM (ret.) Ed Literland and MSG (ret.) Tim Gamache performed the Missing Man Ceremony, which Ward led for many years up to his passing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current Commander of American Legion, Post 2. Richard Schreiner, Jr., signed over the items and assisted with unveiling the case. A Vietnam era poncho liner was used to cover the display case.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Friends of the Library thanked all who made donations to the display. A special thanks to those who donated the plaques.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul Fitta, who served with Ward in Vietnam, spoke next. He talked about their days together in the service and about their friendship after the war. He also spoke about a song Ward had his kids sing whenever Paul visited. Something about the Boston Red Sockets not being a great team.</p>

<p>Pat Ward carried a plaque forward in honor of her husband. The plaque was mounted on the wall next to the display case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kim Ward Holley talked about her father and read a few letters her father sent to the local papers over the years to remember the Vietnam veterans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few friends stood and recalled days with Ward.</p>

<p>Refreshments were served afterwards.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
