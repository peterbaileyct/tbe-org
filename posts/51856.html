<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As autumn rolls in, <em>Pokémon GO </em>continues to captivate players with exciting events and updates. Here’s a roundup of the latest news for Pokémon GO fans in Bristol:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokémon GO October 2024 events schedule is here, and October brings it more Pokémon from the Galar region as we enter the second month of the Max Out Season!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next Sewaddle Community Day in Pokémon GO will be on Saturday, Oct. 5, from 2 to 5 p.m. After the event ends, players will be able to participate in four-star Raid Battles. If a player wins a raid, more Sewaddle will appear around the Gym for 30 minutes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, Raid Hours take place every Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. This is the perfect chance to get out there and catch yourself a Legendary Pokémon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mega Mawile is set to arrive in Pokémon GO as part of a new Raid Day event on Oct. 12. Fans have been waiting for the Mega Evolution of Mawile to arrive in Pokémon GO for a while now, and it seems that the Steel and Fairy-type Pokémon from the Hoenn region will finally be a part of the game very soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LASTLY, A new large-scale Pokémon Go event has been announced, like Pokémon Go Fest and Pokémon Go Tour. Pokemon Go Wild Area 2024 will feature both an in-person event in Fukoka, Japan, as well as a Global event one week later. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Details about Pokémon Go Wild Area are limited at this time, but the event will see the in-game debuts of Toxel and Toxtricity, as well as their Shiny versions. Toxtricity has been a fan-favorite since making its debut in Pokémon Sword and Shield, so a lot of fans should be happy about its arrival in Pokémon Go!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The in-person event will be held Nov. 16 through Nov. 17, while the Global event will take place Nov. 23 and Nov. 24. A ticket for the event is now on sale in the game's store, and costs $11.99. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Readers should note that (as of this writing) the description in the store incorrectly has the description for the ticket from this year's Go Fest event. Instead, ticketed players will get items like an Incubator and Max Particle Pack. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who buy the ticket and play the game between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 will get special Timed Research that offers early access to a Toxel mask avatar item.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we look forward to October! For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pokemongolive.com">www.pokemongolive.com</a>. Until next time Trainers!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
