<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, it’s Monday so let’s grin and bear it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forecast for the week calls for temperatures in the 80s with maybe rain on Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Wetlands Inlands Commission meeting</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By a show of hands, has anyone ever attended a Wetlands Inlands Commission meeting that did not have business before them? It lacks the sexiness and steaminess of a city council meeting but that does not diminish its importance. The next commission meeting is Monday, Sept. 12, from 6:30-10 p.m. in the Bristol Board of Education Auditorium. See you there!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The TBE Parking Lot Patrol inspected the parking lot on Mix Street near the ballfields on Sunday afternoon. After years of neglect and abuse, the lot is finally receiving much-needed attention. Hallelujah!</p>

<h3>Ivy Drive School</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all this ballyhoo regarding school tours recently, this is an excellent time to reflect on a previous school tour. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ivy Drive School, located north of Farmington Avenue, in the northeast section of town, opened in the fall of 1967. On May 26, 1968, for two hours, students provided tours of the elementary school for the public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, 14 years later, in December of 1981, school administrators discussed closing the school due to declining enrollment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It survived and remains open today.</p>

<h3>Obscure Bristol Trivia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who was Ivy Drive School’s first principal?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Answer in Tuesday’s TBE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Tuesday, until then, people.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
