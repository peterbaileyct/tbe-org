<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis team is looking to improve on its four-win campaign from one short year ago and returns some experience to the courts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Led by senior and number one singles player Brooke Treannie, the Lancers are still growing by the match and look to improve position by position along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the BEHS girls tennis team this year:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach: </strong>Barbara Lessard (eighth season)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Year</strong>: 4-11 overall; 4-2 in CCC South play</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Losses</strong>: Brianna Kelley, Jena Cefaly, Ashlee Lewandoski, Brie-Anna McCann, and Gina D’Angelo</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>: Brooke Treannie (sr) No. 1 singles, Adrianna Reay (so), and Ava Gesner (so). Most of the team's positions are yet to be determined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Outlook</strong>: The squad won a combined nine matches over the last two scholastic seasons and improved by one match in CCC South confrontations over that same timeframe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers return three important players to the team this year in the form of senior Brooke Treannie and sophomores Adrianna Reay and Ava Gesner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lessard is still figuring out where all her players fit in the lineup, but the one known position will be Treannie being the number one singles player for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treannie was the regular at No. 2 last year, winning several of her matches at that position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will that mean Gesner moves up the ladder in singles play?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The then freshman played at both third and fourth singles for the Lancers in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Reay earned plenty of valuable experience playing at No. 2 doubles last year with a couple different partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She won a match or two along the way and should be improved over her second varsity campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team will continue to learn and develop over the season and should be better as the second half of the campaign approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are a developing team,” said Lessard about her program. “Our goal is to improve both individually and as a team, work on strategies and enjoy the game of tennis.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Matches to Watch: </strong>Eastern opens the 2022 campaign on the road at Simsbury on Monday (3:45 p.m.) and starts the home portion of its schedule this Friday against Tolland - also at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting on April 21 against Avon, the Lancers are home for four straight matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, of course, the big showdown takes place on May 20 as Eastern tangles with Bristol Central on the road.</p>
