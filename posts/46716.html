<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you thought May was eventful, wait until I tell you all about June! They are packing on the Pokémon power, and I am all for it. Let me tell you what’s happening this month, and this weekend!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting Sunday, June 9, from 2 to 5 p.m., we have Community Day for Goomy! If you are struggling to capture 20 dragon Pokémon to evolve Poiple, this is your best day to meet that requirement to get your Naganadel. Goomy can also come in as a shiny version too, so if you’re lucky, you will have a yellow Goomy instead of the purple one. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For its featured attack, Evolve Sliggoo (Goomy’s Evolution) during the event or up to five hours afterward to get a Goodra that knows the Charged Attack Thunder Punch. You can only evolve it if the weather condition is rainy or if the Rainy Lure is activated.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just a reminder for the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I have more updates for Rayquaza Raids. It will start on June 29 between 12 and 6 p.m. This is also an Elite Raid. Elite Raids are a challenging variety of Raid Battle. They appear from special Raid Eggs that take 24 hours to hatch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the Raid Egg hatches, a Raid Boss will appear for 30 minutes—but take note that Elite Raid Bosses can only be battled in-person. Gather your friends and prepare for an epic confrontation! It can also be a shiny variant if you are lucky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defeat Mega Rayquaza in an Elite Raid, and you’ll earn an opportunity to catch Rayquaza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, Trainers will not be able to participate in Elite Raids using Remote Raid Passes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we ready ourselves for the middle of June for a special event! For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pokemongolive.com">www.pokemongolive.com</a>. </p>

<p>Until next time Trainers!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
