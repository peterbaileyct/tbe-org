<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central softball team, sitting out first round play in Class L competition due to a well-earned bye, starts its postseason journey on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the second ranked Rams battling a very familiar non-conference opponent in second round play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 15 Pomperaug (13-8), a 9-3 winner over No. 18 Killingly, earned a shot at Central (4 p.m. at BCHS) in a rematch from April 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That afternoon, the Rams were able to topple the Panthers over an 8-0 thumping.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those types of victories helped lead the Rams to a 19-1 regular season ledger, earning that No. 2 seed over a loaded Class L field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That fact that we’re 19-1 isn’t something I expected but I think we are satisfied with 19-1 for the regular season,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “We set some outcome-based goals which was to win the CCC South,and we did that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, after a spirited 1-0 loss to Southington in the CCC Tournament title tilt, it’s time for the big prize for the Class LL Runner-up in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means recently minted Class L All-Staters, shortstop Kaley&nbsp;Laird and pitching sensation Sophia Torreso, will be leading their troops into action against that pesky team from Pomperaug.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s a one game at a time method with the playoffs having arrived for the excellent program over at Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We want to see how far we can go in the state tournament,” said Hayes. “Those are our goals coming in. But, like I’ve said before numerous times, all we want to do is come out here and compete and that’s what we do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only one upset took place on Tuesday for the teams that did play in Class L.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The top four programs in the bracket, No. 1 North Haven (20-0 regular season), No. 2 Bristol Central, No. 3 Jonathan Law (18-2) and Class L defending champion Masuk (No. 4, 17-3) will be in the mix during second round competition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 22 Bristol Eastern (12-9 overall) pulled off a tremendous 6-5 upset of No. 11 Nonnewaug (are the two Bristol programs on a collision course down the road?) but the rest of the bracket remains intact.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Credit the four seniors at Central</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central squad is a unit of four seniors strong with all sorts of remarkable talent surrounding the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso, the George Washington University bound pitcher, has been tremendous and could have just four games left to compete in before her scholastic career concludes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like last season, she’s thrown over 100 innings, has 400-plus career strikeouts and carries an ERA this year that would be only worth about sixty cents if turned into money.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird is the ultimate leader every team craves, and the shortstop doesn’t make mistakes out in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over just CCC Tournament play alone, the spunky Laird batted .750 from the dish and had more than a couple hits against Southington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget senior Lorelei Stancavage is an uncrowned All-State catcher who has been catching a couple Division I pitchers for quite some time now.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her bat is as lethal as her defense behind the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget about the leadership component she brings to each and every game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of defense, Adrianna Lubrico has been as consistent in the field as anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another senior standout, she fits in seamlessly with the Rams and plays her role to perfection.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The impressive run by BC &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since coming back from the pandemic, this run the Bristol Central softball team has been on is simply tremendous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was 22-5 overall last season and, adding to the current 21-2 ledger from this year, the Rams’ 43-7 record is simply a tribute to all the hard work that senior crew has put in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To not have a freshmen season, to come out here and this group of seniors have won three CCC South titles is really impressive,” said Hayes. “It’s not a run we’re going to see again [for] a while. I’m just very appreciative. I’m really grateful that I get to come out here and be able to coach these kids.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This could be a postseason to remember as the squad from Central wants to get back to the championship tilt and compete for a title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is looking for its first championship since 1985 when the program booted Windham by a 3-2 final to seize the Class L crown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this team has the ability to run the gauntlet and get to Championship Saturday on June 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Like I’ve said numerous times, it’s not lost on me that these kids are special,” said Hayes. “I don’t take it for granted and I don’t think any of these other players do and none of these other coaches do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s really a lot of fun to come out here with them.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>This year’s championship showdowns will be taking place from Burrill Family Field on the campus of the University of Connecticut. The old title games previously took place in Stratford but the facility at UConn will be an excellent venue to showcase some of Connecticut’s top talent…According to the UConn website, “Burrill Family Field holds a capacity of 518 including 250 chair back seats. The field’s dimensions are 200’ down the left field line, 220’ to straight-away center field and 200’ down the line in right field.”&nbsp;</p>
