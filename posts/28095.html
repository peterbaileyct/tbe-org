<p>Happy Fiscal New Year everyone! How many GMB reads were out late Friday, June 30, celebrating the fiscal new year with fireworks, M-80's and cherry bombs? There is nothing quite like a new fresh set of books. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those that enjoy covertly listening to other people's conversations, Eavesdropping Anonymous (EA) practices HFH: Hover, Feign, Have. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hover: lurk near your target but don’t look like you are lurking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feign absorption: look completely absorbed in something you are not really doing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have a prop: have an item to fiddle with that blends in.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
