<p>BRISTOL - It was only a matter of time before the girls lacrosse team from Bristol Eastern was going to hit the pay window this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Loaded with offensive talent, the Lancers earned their first victory of the campaign, sinking Wolcott 11-8 on Saturday from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters improved to 1-2 overall while the Eagles fell to 0-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Eastern’s Jayna Hatcher played extremely well to keep Wolcott from a big scoring afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t all about defense for Hatcher as she added a goal to the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hatcher is an ever-improving player who hangs her hat on defense but it’s becoming obvious her offensive game is catching up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with Hatcher, Vanessa Drury came through in several clutch situations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury, who scored four goals in the 11-7 loss to Lewis Mills on Thursday, bounced in two goals against the Eagles but it was more than just the scoring.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of interceptions, draw wins and ground balls, Drury put together a complete match effort by generating several of those.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Kenzie Aparo - a slick lefty - dropped in two goals while Sarah Hartley added a goal to the till.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley and Carolyn Wilson both played well defensively along with&nbsp;Avery Ellis in the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not lost in the effort was the offensive onslaught of Emma Stavens as she blasted in five goals and added two assists to lead Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isabella Santulli led Wolcott with three goals while teammate Sage Thornton matched that total as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Alyssa Stango zipped up 10 saves to keep the Eagles hanging around in the fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time management helped the Kingstreeters once the program took the lead, running out the clock to preserve their three-goal push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are on the road for two matches next week, hoping to keep up the momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern must spend most of its gas money on a trip to Edwin O. Smith to Storrs on Monday (3:45 p.m.) while traveling to Enfield on Thursday for a 1 p.m. extravaganza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, April 17, it’s city series time as St. Paul Catholic invades Alumni Field (3:45 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
