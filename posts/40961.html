<p>We at the Bristol Edition have received multiple inquiries as to why we have abandoned Bristol Central in our sports reporting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the short answer is, we havenâ€™t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When our tremendous sports correspondent, Mike Letendre, resigned two weeks ago, we contacted the coaches at both Central and Eastern and asked them to send us info on the games. Whatever information we get, we will write up a story with that..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both schools pledged to cooperate. However, so far, only Bristol Eastern has sent us any reports on the games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is the explanation, pure and simple. <strong><em>But</em></strong> it is also worth mentioning that we lost our sports reporter because we could not pay a fair wage for the work required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition has thousands of readers every day, according to our web site provider, but we only have maybe one hundred subscribers or donors to our organization. We have asked people to sign up as subscribers for as little as $6.00 a month. But many readers, it appears, prefer to read for free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe we offer a valuable news service to the people of Bristol, but it cannot go on forever without a reliable revenue source. We are searching for answers, whether that be by increasing the number of subscribers, charging for some of our services, getting corporate sponsors, or putting advertising in the content. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope our readers appreciate the efforts we have made to provide you with Bristol news for the past three years. If you compare us with other news organizations, we offer superior coverage of Bristol day by day. But those days cannot go on forever without financial support.</p>
