<p>BERLIN - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team absorbed a tough 5-0 loss to Berlin from Sage Park on the Berlin Turnpike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, in the CCC south showdown, were steamrolled a bit as Bella Salina led the Berlin offensive charge with two goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teammates Sydney Bronk, Kate Morris and Julia Palmese were responsible for the other three tallies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats zipped up a 3-0 cushion by the half time break - notching its first three goals over a span of 12 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin ended the showdown with two additional scores over second period play to snare the win - remaining undefeated on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was outshot 16-0 at the net and most of the play belonged to the Redcoats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lancers’ keeper Hailey Beebe did a tremendous job in the goal despite being in the line of fire over the entire eighty minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] Lancers responded in the second half and showed a lot of fight and improved play,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “But it wasn't enough to keep pace with a talented Berlin team.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin overshot Eastern overall 28-1 and enjoyed a stunning 8-0 edge on corner kicks alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back home on Tuesday for a CCC interdivisional bout against South Windsor.</p>
