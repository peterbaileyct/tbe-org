<p>MERIDEN - Every time the Bristol American Legion baseball team plays a Zone 1 game at Simsbury, it’s not unusual to see a helicopter or two in the sky as Bradley International Airport isn’t that far down the road from Memorial Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more mature Bristol fans remember the show M*A*S*H (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Army_Surgical_Hospital">Mobile Army Surgical Hospital</a>), a comedy drama about the Korean War.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And maybe one of those helicopters should have made a landing at Ceppa Field in Meriden on Sunday as Bristol lost a couple players that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It started in the first game as pitching stud Roberto Cruz pulled his troublesome hamstring attempting to round third base late in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw 103 pitches the day but was saddled with a tough no decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Bristol won first game, 10-7, Post 2 was back at it again in the immediate rematch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third frame, first baseman Tyler Stickels smashed his finger making a putout and also had to leave the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‘Now, we’re kind of a MASH unit,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “Roberto’s got the bad hamstring. Stickels’ got a bad finger. He was bleeding all over the place. Now we’re down to ten healthy guys.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means there’s little margin for error over Bristol’s final two regular season games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 squares off against West Hartford on Tuesday (5:30 p.m.) and Simsbury on Wednesday (5:30 p.m.), both from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got to go with who’s here and suck it up,” said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scheduled to pitch for Bristol against West Hartford is Alex Canzellarini - looking for a little pay back against the undefeated Zone 1 program (14-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the chucker is due for a big game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why not against the top rank program in all the state?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alex is going to start on Tuesday against West Hartford,” said LaPenta. “Hopefully, he can give us a good outing and save the pen because we don’t have much left in the pitching department.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of arms, Tyler Martin, Roberto Cruz, and Matt Beaucar are out due to the pitch count rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome could be used in a pinch while a combination of Elliot Norris and Jayden Churchill could spell Canzellarini as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Churchill on fire from the dish</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the month of July arrived, the Bristol squad has stitched together a 4-1 record - winners of three straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over that stretch, which helped Post 2 lock in second place in Zone 1, Churchill has been nearly unstoppable at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over those five contests, Churchill - who has been tremendous in the second slot in the batting order - has hit .667 (12-of-18) over that stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also scored eight runs, tallied three RBI, and walked numerous times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of those 12 hits were doubles while stealing four bases to help Bristol get to the pay window multiple times. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a beast at Bristol Eastern as well this past spring, posting a batting average of .328 over 67 at-bats that included 22 hits, 12 walks, 14 RBI, and nine stolen bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s painfully obvious that his outstanding play at Bristol Eastern carried over to the summer months for Bristol American Legion baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tired but ready for more</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sunday’s twin bill saw Bristol battle Meriden over a combined 16 grueling innings with limited shade, heat, and the like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after two huge triumphs, LaPenta was certainly ready for a little R &amp; R.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ll sleep good tonight,” said LaPenta with a bit of a grin.&nbsp;</p>
