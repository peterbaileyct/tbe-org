<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Central girls basketball team has enjoyed tremendous success as of late and this year’s team returns more than a few talented players that have been there and done that, looking to taking another step forward.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, veteran head coach Steve Gaudet must intergrade several freshmen competitors into the mix, eager to hit the court.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will have to survive a stretch without senior standout Brooke Watson, recovering from an injury, but this program has enough in the tank to have another successful campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at the Rams this season:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL GIRLS BASKETBALL&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach:&nbsp;</strong>Steve Gaudet (20th season)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>17-7 overall in 2022-23 (No. 8 Bristol Central lost in Class L, second round action to North Haven, 58-46).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 19 seasons at Central, Gaudet has an all-time record of 114-271.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Kaley Laird.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Arianna Rivera (sr, guard, 9.2 ppg), Brooke Watson (sr, guard/forward, injured, 8.9 ppg), Leilani Jackson (jr, forward, 9.8 ppg), Nicole Riemer (so, forward, 9.3 ppg), Molly McMahon (so, guard), Julia Pikiell (so, guard, ppg).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Additions:&nbsp;</strong>Freshmen&nbsp;Laylani Cespedes, Olivia Louis, Myah Steiner and Gabby Bernier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Returning veterans, shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Depth&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Central will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;This squad has put together two seasons of back-to-back .500 ball. Those returning starters know what it takes to win close games over the past couple years. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Relevant Fact:&nbsp;</strong>The last time the Rams had three consecutive winning seasons came during 1999-2001. Central went 37-23 over that stretch (61.6-percent) and were postseason participants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Central has several critical players back in the mix for 2023-24 but will have to take the court without a ton of depth and a boatload of underclassmen – some with varying amounts of experience – must produce for the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a great year last year, but we are very inexperienced this year,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“With Watson being out, we have one senior (Rivera) and one junior (Jackson) and the rest of the varsity team is three sophomores and four freshmen.&nbsp;We will take our&nbsp;lumps early on, but I anticipate&nbsp;that we will improve over time as the season progresses and the young kids gain experience.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of those sophomores played a ton of minutes last year and that means those underclassmen are already ahead of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No played at Central scored in double-figures last season but that didn’t mean much because the squad played excellent team defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the offense was diversified as the top-four leading scorers were less than a point apart, all posting around nine points-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect big things from senior Ariana Rivera (9.3 ppg) and junior Leilani Jackson (9.8) – the two top scorers from 2022-23.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson is a lethal shooter from anywhere within the three-point stripe and can finish at the hoop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has a nose for the ball, hits her free throws and doesn’t mind playing a little defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leilani Jackson is an outstanding scorer who will continue to knock down big shots for us,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“She will also have to step up her leadership and help Arianna Rivera as they are the only two healthy upperclassmen at the start of the season.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivera is a perfect senior leader on this squad who excels on both ends of the court, along with fellow senior Brooke Watson (8.9 ppg, team-leading 15 three-pointers).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson will start the season on the injured list and Gaudet hopes to get her back right around midseason. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jackson-Rivera duo will be counted on to score even more this year, getting those scoring averages into double-figures.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivera can put the ball into the hoop, finish in the lane and has quick hands for steals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if she – along with Jackson – can improve their shooting from three-point territory, Central’s going to have a difficult 1-2 combo to guard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Like Jackson and Watson, Rivera was an all-conference player last year for the Rams,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“Her improved range and ability to get the ball to the basket will be key to the Rams season.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then off the bench last season, sophomore stud Nicole Riemer (9.3 ppg) was simply tremendous.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was the leading scorer off the bench, is capable of a 20-point game on any given night while returning as the squad’s best rebounder.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riemer is tough in the paint and her board play and defense will help set the tone this season as she steps into a larger role.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nicole Riemer was a huge contributor as a freshman last year, and she has shown a tremendous amount of growth from last year to this year,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“She will be an integral part of our team's success.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomores Molly McMahon and Julia Pikiell should see expanded roles as well and if the duo can make shots, that contribution will go a very long way. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without Watson, who nearly splashed in half of the squad’s three-pointers last season, someone is going to have to drain shots from downtown to keep opposing defenses honest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond that crew, varsity experience will have to come on the fly for several first-year competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Depth is a major concern,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“We lost some key players from last year, so we are going to need to stay healthy and develop our young players.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet expects to get some play out of&nbsp;freshmen&nbsp;Laylani Cespedes, Olivia Louis, Myah Steiner and Gabby Bernier, helping to spell the absence of Watson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But any minutes that freshman crew can contribute could go a long way during the second half of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These freshmen will be forced to play much more meaningful&nbsp;minutes,” said Gaudet due to the Watson injury.&nbsp;“Cespedes and Louis have shown that they can contribute this preseason, and their athleticism is an outstanding addition to the team.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scholastic basketball season is a marathon, not a sprint, and it will take a bit of time to see where this squad can go once all the pieces are healthy and have a little seasoning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of the league, Gaudet says that “Berlin and Middletown&nbsp;look like the two best teams in the South.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, the Rams get into that conversation later in the year. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch this season</strong>: The Rams have a slew of home games to start the campaign and the battle on December 27 – pitting pesky Platt against Central at the annual BC Holiday Classic – should be a good game to catch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, January 16 is the first Central/Eastern showdown – taking place from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium while the rematch rolls around on February 12 at BEHS.</p>
