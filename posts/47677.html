<p>Bristol travelled to Naugatuck on Tuesday and had trouble mounting much of an attack, but Tom Pirog pitched a 1-hit gem against Naugatuck, striking out 10 in an overpowering performance, allowing Bristol to walk away with a 1-0 victory.</p>

<p>Bristol punched in a run in the first extra inning with Caleb Molinsky driving in the only run of the game. Brian Grabowski tripled to start the eighth and came home on Molinsky’s single. </p>

<p>The solo run was all Pirog needed, but Molinsky topped off his night by getting the final two outs of the contest. He did make things interesting by walking two batters in the bottom of the eighth but was able to escape the threat and Bristol came home with the win.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky and Rocco Spirito each had two hits to lead the offense. One of Spirito’s hits was a double. </p>

<p>Bristol now stands at 5-4 in Zone One and sits in third place. West Hartford remains in first with a 6-0 record.</p>

<p>Tonight, Bristol returns to Naugatuck High School for the second of three in a row against Naugatuck, as the teams will play again at Muzzy on Thursday night.</p>
