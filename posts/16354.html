<p>While very good points were made in his article about field conditions in Bristol, there is more to the story than just the fields. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>As you drive into Bristol on Route 6, NO scenic drive for sure, you soon see an abandoned property across from Taco Bell. This property is a total eyesore! The sidewalk that fronts the property has grass that is at least 3-ft. tall which obstructs views of pedestrians and cars who may be turning into the Big Lots plaza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the owner(s) of this property refuse to mow the grass (at a minimum) the city should do it and back charge them?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have reached out to my 1st District council representatives asking them to act but feel this blighted property needs to be publicized. At one time the city was much more proactive with such conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pride in our city is shown in many ways, the conditions of our parks, ball fields and blighted properties all contribute to enhancing our standing as a community.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
