<p>ROXBURY, MA - This past Saturday, the 34th Annual New England Track &amp; Field Indoor Championships took place from the Reggie Lewis Track and Field Center from just outside of Boston in Roxbury, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event was on two year hiatus due to COVID but this past weekend, athletes from all over New England made a return to the venue - including Bristol’s own Jarrett Boxley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the multi-talented athlete from Bristol Central was ready for the challenge of the 55 meter hurdles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boxley qualified for the New England’s at Connecticut’s State Open from the Floyd Little Athletic Center on Saturday, February 19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished as the runner up in 7.86 seconds to earn a two-hour car ride to the New Englands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And several of the Connecticut’s best joined him including Michael Johnson of Lewis Mills, Blake Battaglia from Wilbur Cross and Ellington’s Josh Wilkie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the preliminary round in Roxbury, Boxley did a tremendous job, finishing in 10th place overall in a time of just under eight seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He actually finished the heat in 7.994 seconds and just missed the cut for final’s qualification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilkie placed eighth overall - just beating the cutoff - in a finish of 7.981 seconds as Boxley was right there in the mix at the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Congrats Jarrett on a great senior indoor season rocking the maroon and white,” said Bristol Central coach Kiara Bonilla via Twitter on Saturday. “Tied for 10th in New England! So proud of how far you’ve come.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boxley had a great showing in Massachusetts and there’s more of that to come down the road for the talented senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“[The] Nationals [are] next weekend and outdoor [track] is around the corner,” said Bonilla.</p>
