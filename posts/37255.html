<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday night, at approximately 6:24 p.m., under the bright lights of the Rockwell Theatre at Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School, Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano was sworn in as Bristol’s mayor for his second term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With his sweeping victory last week and newly sworn-in city officials seated behind him, the mayor laid out his vision for the city and touted his accomplishments, “The heart of our city is beating again,” Caggiano proudly stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To that end, during his <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/blog/2023/11/14/mayor-caggianos-second-inaugural-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-minute speech</a>, Caggiano spoke of his many accomplishments, including Bristol WORKS and Bristol Bazaar, while also saving the Wheler project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm proud that we saved the Wheeler Health project by offering a questioning city council alternatives,” he offered. “It made the project better as we crafted an agreement to share parking, reduce the size of the lot, and move the parcel.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving the lot to the north, Caggiano said, resulted in another acre of land., which can be sold to another developer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's a huge momentous event when we can say that the city doesn't really own the center mall parcel anymore,” said Caggiano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, he said that he believes his greatest accomplishment is reversing a three-generation trend of stagnation downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In 1961, we started urban renewal. In 2021, the election theme was building a better Bristol, where I stated that ‘Bristol is an all-heart city that is missing its soul.’ But now downtown is being rebuilt.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding downtown, he acknowledged the previous administration for beginning KindCare and the renovations to city hall. He then spoke of things to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The brand-new Hope Street parking garage is slated to be built next year on the center square lot, and the 'By Carrier' mixed-use project will add the first new live component downtown and new ‘play’ options with first-floor retail including four dedicated restaurant spaces and overall, about 15,600 square feet of retail space. This is what people have been asking for.”</p>

<p>He then announced that PKL Enterprises, a developer from Providence, was just approved through zoning, to build on Parcel 10 facing Main Street, a mixed-use building with four work/live spaces on the first floor with a total of 30 apartments. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The heart of our city is beginning to beat again,” the mayor said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, he added, there are other projects to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor went on to say that adding resident's downtown will receive a great deal of his attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The main focus of the work over the next two years will be to add many more new city dwellers in and around Centre Square to reach our goal of 3,000 new residents. This smart growth of our population will support the downtown without taxing our resources.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano also discussed leadership and how he will continue to listen to those who do not agree with him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I will continue to be a leader that leads with grace and dignity even when those that disagree are disagreeable. I will listen to many points of view and try to make the best decisions for the best of all the city residents,” he said.</p>

<p>With his party’s sizeable victory and his Facebook page gaining followers, the mayor attributed their success and popularity to his administration demonstrating accountability for the basics in local government, education, public safety and public infrastructure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also addressed change. The mayor said that under his administration, there had been plenty of open debate, public participation, and a city council that thinks for itself. And he encouraged everyone, regardless of party affiliation, to get involved in local government.</p>

<p>The mayor was sworn in by Judge Jason Welch.</p>
