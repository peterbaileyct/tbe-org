<p>After the Bristol Central softball team hung a 3-1 loss on Bristol Eastern last Friday, the Lancers were still winless on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern pitching stud Ali Tellier made a bold prediction, saying that first road victory would come ‘next week.’&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, a new week is upon the Eastern softball program and, as predicted, the Lancers finally hit the pay window on the road - scooping up a 24-0 romp.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 6-7 overall while Farmington - on a two-game winning streak before tangling with the Lancers - fell to 2-12.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters needed just five innings to defeat the River Hawks as Tellier threw a perfect game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied 13 strikeouts and did not allow a hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Grace D’Amato came through with three hits, including a home run, while collecting four RBI over a busy day of action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato’s homer was her second of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory broke a four-game slump by the Lancers while Farmington entered the contest scoring 37 runs over its last two wins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BE Girls Lacrosse back to winning</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team dropped a tough two goal decision on the road at Edwin O. Smith last Friday, the Lancers bounced right back at Enfield on Monday, surging to a 9-6 win in a CCC South confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 6-5 on the campaign - winning four of its past five matches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciara Collins and Vanessa Drury each flipped in four goals to lead the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy added a goal while keeper Avery Ellis scooped up 13 saves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Smith the previous Friday, the Lancers held a 6-4 edge but could not sustain it in the end, falling 11-9.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins led the charge with four goals, Drury nabbed two, while the grouping of McKenzie Aparo, Allison Sullivan and Emma Stavens each tallied one goal apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ellis was once again stellar in the goal for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Eastern battles Middletown from Alumni Field on Wednesday at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the Lancers travel to Maltby Street in Bristol to battle St. Paul Catholic at 6 p.m. at McPhee Field on Friday.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spina is a scoring machine for Bristol boys lacrosse</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Spina has been a scoring machine for the Bristol coop program this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s set a new Bristol boys lacrosse scoring record with 50 goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s with nearly a half-dozen matches left to go in the campaign to improve on that impressive number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In lacrosse action on Monday, Eastern fell at St. Paul Catholic, 14-4.&nbsp;</p>
