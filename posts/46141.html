<p><strong>A thank you to Jake</strong></p>

<p>Marilyn (Nocera) Egan celebrated her 75th birthday Saturday, and that included pizza and cake with her sisters, Carinne Greaves and Lorette Caoutte, my housemate. The three drove to Max Pizza IV to pick up two large, one to be paid for with coupons. Well, Lorette, the carrier of the coupons forgot them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They only had enough to pay for one, by Lorette, and when this young fellow, Jake, heard of this problem he forked over the currency to pay for the second one. When they arrived back home with the goodies, I was one of their benefactors. Thank you, Jake, that was a wonderful jester. </p>

<p><strong>Spreading lawn fertilizer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My full-time job was working second shift in the maintenance department at the Bristol Public Library. I’d arrive at 2 p.m. and my boss, Gabe Straun, would leave shortly afterwards. One particular non-windy day, Gabe spent the entire morning with our seeder to drop fertilizer down. After he left, clueless, I took out the lawn mower and went to town spreading the fertilizer closer to and into Main and Summer streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day, still unaware the lawn had been fertilized, I went into our office where Gabe sat and he just stared at me. Never saw that look before. I never heard the end of that one. In fact. any new guy coming into our department heard the story often.</p>

<p><strong>Embarrassing mom</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some may remember that I had the license plate “TIHS’ on my car. I was in a down stretch mentally when I got it, and it represented the way I felt about my life. In case you don’t get it, spell the plate backwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, one day a friend of my mother’s stopped in to see her and told what she had seen on this particular car. Embarrassed, my mother, a stout woman who always did things with class, replied, “Oh my gosh, that was my son Bob’s car!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lady who saw it was a classy and straight woman, too, the mother of Bristol’s Ruth Hassel, a runner-up one year in the Miss CT Contest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Falls Brook Road</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This road was named as such after the development of Falls Brook Village, the houses built there in 1952. The brook nearby must have been known as Falls Brook.</p>

<p><strong>Memorial Day</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally called Decoration Day here in America, it came about after the Civil War. In 1971, it became a Federal Holiday on that last Day of May. It’s a day to remember our veterans who died in active military service. Take the time and visit our Memorial Boulevard, and perhaps one of our cemeteries.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myself, I visit St. Joseph Cemetery to visit some of the vets that I knew, and otherwise. We are losing these men and women too fast.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
