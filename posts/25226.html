<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have attended the second Bristol Boys and Girls Club gala, another terrific evening with a short program that put kids front and center. And the music was great. I am putting together a short article with photos that I hope will capture some of the fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Favorite family texts during the week featured the grandkids, one of whom got a shot at DJ’ing for WPKN-89.5 on the FM dial at a fundraiser. Not a bad gig for a 3-year-old. Then, there is another text with a quip about some sneakers Mary bought for him. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent: “You are going to have to tell Gaga (Mary’s grandma name) thank you.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandchild (also, 3-years-old and not the DJ): “Yeah, they are coming in real handy.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later, parent to Mary and me: “Who says that? No one around here does.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two Fridays ago, Mary and I attended another Hartford Stage production, this one Shakespeare's’ “A Winter’s Tale.” As always, Hartford Stage provided a wonderful drama, set in the early 1900’s, with a set that captures the mood and tone in what I can only call magical.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The play comes late in the Shakespearean opus, and while it is a comedy the first half is nothing less than tragic—so if you can get out to see it, strap yourself in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading/listening this week includes another favorite, On the Media with its latest three segments under the title, “Rupert. Logan. Clarence.” The first two segments cover Rupert Murdock and his media empire. The final one gets into some deep background on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
