<p>BRISTOL - Take two for the Bristol Central/Cheshire second round Class LL clash ended with another washout on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s a complete shame because No. 5 Central was up on No. 12 Cheshire by a 3-0 push going into the top of the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central All-State pitching sensation Sophia Torreso had a no-hitter going, striking out three and walking four before the game was foiled with one out in the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rain simply never let-up as gentle splashes became a full-blown downpour - ending the game as Cheshire had a couple ducks on the pond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors had the leadoff hitter on base to open the first two stanzas but nothing came of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cheshire’s Grace Lurz started the contest off with a full count walk, stole second, and eventually went to third on a fielder’s choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Torreso fanned Karla Carangelo to finish off the half inning without allowing a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Central went for two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sklenka and Lorelei Stancavage drew back-to-back one out walks while a wild pitch advanced the duo into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Leah Sklenka (2-for-2, two RBI) sent the twosome home off a slick slicing single to right field as Central nabbed a 2-0 push through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the second, Cheshire’s Tai Byrd nabbed a walk but the Central defense did the rest - retiring the side to keep the visitors off the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the rain started to intensify a bit in the bottom of the second, the locals pieced together a two-out rally to net a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adrianna Lubrico started things off with a two-out single up the middle and went to second on a wild pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Kaley Laird sliced a base hit to short left and when the fielder struggled to pick up the ball up, Lubrico scooted home as Central’s edge reached 3-0 after two completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso was sharp in the third as she struck out two and did not allow a hit through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then it truly began to pour as Torreso allowed two walks in the fourth - sandwiched between a groundout by Carangelo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the game was quickly called due to rain, the field flooded within a 10-minute stretch as conditions simply became unplayable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, Cheshire - who probably used all its remaining gas money this year traveling to the Mum City on two separate occasions - will have to come back for a third trip on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>One more time…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is the third time the charm in this epic encounter?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will the Central/Cheshire showdown commence on Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does Mother Nature have something else in mind?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come down to Casey Field on Friday at 10 a.m. for a can’t miss showdown between two excellent scholastic programs.</p>
