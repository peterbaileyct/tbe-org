<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Special Edition coming your way! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>June is filled with a bunch of awesome events for Pokemon, and this late edition is going to prove that! Let’s dive right to June and get ready for some Pokemon news that will have you pumped to catch them all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting this weekend, Shared Skies has a start time of Saturday, June 1, at 10 a.m., and it will end on Tuesday, Sept. 3, at 10 a.m. From Saturday, June 1, to Tuesday, Sept. 3, you'll have the chance of encountering Hisuian Growlithe, Larvitar, Audino, Axew, Furfrou and Jangmo-o. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is awesome because Poiple can only evolve if you catch 20 dragon Pokemon and 200 candies. All these Pokemon can be shiny too!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the raids, here are Pokemon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Times</span><br>Zapdos - Saturday, June 1, to Monday, June 10<br>Landorus (Incarnate Forme) - Monday, June 10, to Wednesday, June 19<br>Yveltal - Wednesday, June 19, to Friday, June 28<br>Ho-Oh - Friday, June 28, to Monday, July 8<br>Mega Gyarados - Saturday, June 1, to Monday, June 10<br>Mega Alakazam - Monday, June 10, to Wednesday, June 19<br>Mega Charizard Y - Wednesday, June 19, to Friday, June 28<br>Mega Tyranitar - Friday, June 28, to Monday, July 8</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I have more updates for Pokémon Go Fest and what is required to get the highlighted monster this event. Necrozma debuts in raids during Go Fest 2024! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They can be changed to Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings Necrozma through a new mechanic coming to the game during Go Fest: Fusion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dusk Mane Necrozma is created by fusing Solgaleo and Necrozma with Solar Fusion Energy, and Dawn Wings Necrozma is created by fusing Lunala and Necrozma with Lunar Fusion Energy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is every important to know because you can capture multiple of this creature and have both forms. There is a rumor that Ultra Necrozma will be available, and I’ll have more details on that soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Solar Fusion Energy and Lunar Fusion Energy are gathered by battling Necrozma in raids during Go Fest 2024, and it's important to know that Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma can't be traded, transferred to the Professor, or transferred to Pokémon Home. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want that to be in your game, you would need to have those games they came from to be transferred onto the platform you are using.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new Mythical Pokémon Marshadow is also available to all during the first day of the Global Go Fest 2024 event, after first appearing in the local Go Fest events in Sendai, Madrid, and New York City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayquaza is also coming to the raids as a special event! Be on the lookout to take this down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we ready ourselves for the start of June for a special event! For more information, visit www.pokemongolive.com. Until next time Trainers!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
