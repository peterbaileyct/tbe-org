<p>Local activists who have stepped up to demand a stronger response from the mayor after leaflets from white supremacists were discovered on streets in Bristol have formed a group to combat racism on different levels, including direct action and engagement with city offices and commissions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol residents Adam Antar and Camelia Lopez have formed the Bristol Anti-Racism Brigade (BARB) and have created a Facebook page inviting people to join. As of Tuesday, Aug. 2, there were 84 members. The group will meet Thursday, Aug. 4, at the New England Carousel Museum, at 7 p.m. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its description on Facebook, the group denounces "white supremacy, racism, hatred and bigotry in all its forms." In addition, the group resolves to act in both personal and official ways to "ensure the safety and prosperity of all of our neighbors, regardless of superficial divisions."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group intends to celebrate the "lives of people of color and their accomplishments locally and elsewhere," to support diversity programs in the city, encourage the development of programs that inform residents of their rights and services, as well as to address the education of children to ensure that it is free from racism and bigotry.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We resolve to make the City of Bristol, and every place we step a better place," the statement concludes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group is private, but anyone can find it on Facebook. Members can access more information. (Note: I have joined so that I can report on the group.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the moment, the group is developing a mission statement and deciding on committee assignments, dealing with local boards and commissions, including education, city council, police department and parks and recreation. The group has begun a conversation about a new name.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
