<p>Tuesday night, the Bristol Republicans, in a historic win, swept the mayor’s office, the city council, the board of education, and even the Board of Assessment Appeals. &nbsp;The only seat the democrats claimed was treasurer, and that is because their candidate ran unopposed.</p>

<p>A Tsunami struck the Bristol democrats, and when the waters recede, they will need to review what is left in its wake with careful analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did their voters not show up? If so, why? Complacency?&nbsp; Were their voters less enthusiastic than in previous years?&nbsp; Did the republicans outwork them or have a better message?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the coming years, it will be decided if ideology or other factors were the reasons for the Republican’s resounding win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One method that worked effectively for the mayor's race was Jeff Caggiano’s use of video.  Caggiano’s videos numbered in the double digits and showed up often in Facebook feeds.  In many instances, the video ads were generally under 30 seconds and to the point, driving home his message effectively. Perfect for consumers of social media content.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the Democrats rarely used video and relied on a steady stream of mailers, particularly in the campaign’s closing days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1916, automobiles were used for the first time to get Bristol voters to the polls and resulted in one of the largest voter turnouts on record for that time. Instantly both parties realized the value of this emerging technology. As the dissection of the election results begins, it appears at first glance that one party understood the importance of Facebook video ads while the other did not.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One video, however, may come back to haunt the mayor-elect: The Rubber Stamp City Council. The ad shows Candidate Caggiano railing against a Bristol government controlled by one party with no dissenting votes. Ironically, beginning next week, like his predecessor, Caggiano will have complete control of the city government with no dissenting voices. Will his city council be a rubber stamp of his views?&nbsp;Who amongst them will be the dissenting voice he covets without receiving the scourge of the republican party, or the scorn of voters that cast a ballot in their name? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That issue and others are to be determined.&nbsp; For now, Caggiano needs an opportunity to govern before passing judgment.&nbsp;</p>
