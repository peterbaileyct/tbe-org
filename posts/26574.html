<p>It is with heavy heart that we announce the passing of Marcia Ann Casey, age 77, of Nantucket, Mass., on May 10. After suffering a medical event at her home in Siasconset Village Nantucket, our beloved sister and aunt passed away peacefully at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston surrounded by her family. She was a wonderful, kind, generous and loving wife, daughter, sister, aunt, and friend. Her family and dog, Beatrix were her greatest joys, and she cherished every moment spent with them. Her elegance, intellectual curiosity, boundless creativity, and unwavering commitment to her family and passions made her a true force of nature.</p>

<p>Marcia was born in Hartford, Conn., on May 6, 1946, to Julia Markovich Casey and State Representative James P. Casey, who became Mayor of the city of Bristol the following year. She was predeceased by her husband Carl Hoss. She was a proud alumna of Bristol Central and the University of Connecticut, where she received her undergraduate degree before going on to earn her JD at Suffolk University. As an attorney, she was deeply committed to using her legal skills to effect positive change in the world working for Governor Michael Dukakis and then for John Hancock Insurance as a Federal Securities and Corporate Attorney helping facilitate the company going public. After retiring from John Hancock, Marcia opened a Classical Pilates Studio, studied the French novelist Marcel Proust, and spent many hours gardening and writing at her beloved homes in Boston’s North End and Sconset where her home was affectionately named “Rantum Scoot.”</p>

<p>Marcia was passionate about promoting research on the family genetically inherited heart problems. She worked closely with Brigham Women's Hospital to advance this important cause and was deeply committed to improving the lives of those affected by this condition. She also enjoyed attending the Boston Symphony, participating in ballroom dancing, supporting the Children’s Opera, serving on the Board of the Ben Franklin Trust and was active in the Women’s City Club of Boston. She was an accomplished gardener, and her restoration of the 18th-century gardens at Old North Church is a testament to her artistic vision and her deep love of history.</p>

<p>She is survived by her adoring brothers, Daniel Casey and wife Gail, Steven Casey and wife Karen, and David Casey and his wife Lisa. She is also survived by seven special nieces and nephews, Ryan Casey, Kevin Casey and wife Rhia, Jim Casey, Meaghan Casey and husband Loren, Kate Casey and husband Sam, Elizabeth Casey Guadagni and husband Scott, and Matthew Casey, and fiancé Mara. She is also survived by her five great-nieces and nephews, Olive and Miles Casey, Margaret and William Guadagni, and Flora Casey Stender. Marcia's kindness, generosity and incredible dedication to her passions will be remembered and celebrated by all who were lucky enough to know her. She was one in a million, her big personality left an impression on everyone who met her. Her love of learning, her commitment to justice, and her boundless creativity will be deeply missed by all who knew her.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
