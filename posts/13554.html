<p>BRISTOL - After knocking off Wethersfield the previous day, the Bristol Eastern baseball team absolutely spun the grouping of Bulkeley/AAE/Bloomfield on Thursday behind an amazing pitching performance by Ben D’Amato as the sophomore stud threw a no-hitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato went six innings to earn his no-no as the Lancers won by a 10-0 final from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern matched Bristol Central with a final regular season ledger of 9-11 while the Bulkeley program fell to 3-17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was called in the sixth inning due to the mercy rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of mercy, D’Amato dished out very little - showing all the grit his dad and older brother did in an Eastern uniform over the years - as he racked up twelve strikeouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During one stretch, he collected eight consecutive Ks over a major league performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato did not hand out a free pass and allowed only two baserunners as the chucker hit a batter while an infield miscue put a man on first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conor McCormick rumbled up two hits for Eastern, scored three runs, and drove in a run, D'Amato added a single and double for two RBI, Preston Guarda dropped in two singles and collected two RBI while Jaydon Churchill sized up a double while scoring twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored a run in the first when Guarda singled in Connor Cyr for a 1-0 edge as the Kingstreeters never allowed its opponent any chance to respond. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In was still a one run game going into the bottom of the third but Eastern quickly belted the contest wide open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using five hits over the frame, Elliot Norris started things off with a bunt single and scored on McCormick's double to right-centerfield. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill followed up with a double to left center, scoring McCormick, as Eastern led 3-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill went to third on a groundout, scoring on a passed ball, and D'Amato doubled to right center - tagging the dish on a Ryan Maglio single - making it a 5-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern picked up single runs in the fourth and fifth innings with both coming on passed balls as the Kingstreeters nabbed a 7-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth, the Lancers ended the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCormick led off, beating out an infield single, as the final drive of the showdown was heating up. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill got on via an infield error and Connor Cyr made it to first safely when his grounder to second was played too late for a force out at second as the fielder’s choice loaded the bases with no outs. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guarda’s base hit to center scored McCormick and when D'Amato singled up the middle, he won his own game as his two-RBI tally made it 10-0 - concluding the contest via the mercy rule.</p>
