<p>BANGOR, MAINE - The 76th New England Interscholastic Boys and Girls Track &amp; Field Championships from Cameron Stadium in Bangor, Maine came and went on Saturday as Bristol Central had a few representatives at the meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern was also in Maine that day as a certain 800 meter speedster was in action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kylee Barnes performed well in the high jump that afternoon, clearing five feet - good for 14th place overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Barnes was in the thick of it against the best New England had to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Katie Caraco from Reading, Massachusetts took home first place with a make of five feet, five inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a mark Barnes would like to attain after overcoming 5-3 along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was a] great season for Kylee,” said Bristol Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “She is such a talented athlete, and we are really looking forward to having her back next year to pick up where she left off in the jumps!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Anthony Paulino was one of two triple jumpers from Bristol that qualified for the meet in Bangor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned a solid 15th place finish with a leap of 41 feet, two inches to fend off several other jumps along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anthony had a really strong junior season,” said Stafford-Kirk. “He will join the indoor team next year to train and make sure he is ready for a super outdoor senior season.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Central senior Frankie Porrini placed fifth in the 1600, ending the bout in a blazing 4:15.33.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a personal best for the senior standout, earning an All-New England nod for the first time ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie has just gotten better and stronger these past three weeks,” said Stafford-Kirk. “The many miles he has put in over the years paid off. I couldn’t be prouder. He will race the 2k steeplechase at New Balance Nationals next week!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guilford’s Patrick Gandini won the 1600 meters in a blazing 4:09.01 while Newtown’s Sohaib Dissa (4:10.07) was the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Connecticut Class L State and Open champion Tre Blair was excellent in the triple jump once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His furthest make of 44 feet, 10.5 inches was good third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair, the recently minted CHSCA Boys Field Athlete of the Year, ended up with the longest leap of any athlete from Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amity’s Micah Blair came in one spot behind Blair in fourth place (44 feet, 9.75 inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I won’t sugar coat it; this was not the outcome we wanted today,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Tre really hasn’t had a bad day all season. Unfortunately, it happened today. He still walked away with a third-place finish, but he wanted that win. I’m positive he will step up and perform well at New Balance Nationals next week!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two athletes managed to top Blair, needing to reach 47 feet each to do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Conor Morin (Cony) reached 47 feet, six inches to win the New England's while Corbin Flewelling (47-03.50) was the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Eastern’s Jack Mulcunry made a top-eight finish in the 800 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He placed eighth overall in a time of 1:55.02, an excellent finish for the senior standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mulcunry leaves BEHS as the record holder of the 800 meter event and ended up one of the Lancers’ most improved athletes.&nbsp;</p>
