<p>The post that greeted followers on its Facebook page Friday held a dire warning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We need a huge Saturday and Sunday (9a-3p) here because it may be the last." the post begins. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is followed with, "I'm thoroughly disappointed that I have to share this but the bakery may be closing on Monday."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bakery is Bakery on Maple, a local favorite for its custom baked treats and gourmet custom cakes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come Saturday morning owners Erika Stirk and David Landi were busy preparing for the day. Stirk was preparing a tray of bars and Landi hovered over a tray of croissants. Trays of treats were stored in carts, ready to be displayed in the cases out front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, they had been working for hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"A lot of people are behind us," Landi said. "They are supportive of small businesses in Bristol."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, they can show their support in some very specific ways, he said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
