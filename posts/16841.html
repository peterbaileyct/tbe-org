<p>Speaking of the Astros, let's discuss the Bristol Red Sox. The "BriSox" came to Bristol in '73 and left in '82. They were a AA affiliate for the Boston Red Sox in the Eastern League and played their home games at Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know the greats but here is to the guys that are not household names:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Rick Jones</li><li>Lanny Phillips</li><li>Otis Foster</li><li>Sam Bowen</li><li>Steve Tarbell</li><li>Steve Dillard</li><li>Manuel Crespo</li><li>Tim Blackwell</li><li>Julio Valdéz</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first game in Bristol was Saturday, April 21, 1973, vs. Trois Rivieres Eagles (English: Three Rivers Eagles), a Cincinnati Reds affiliate. That Eagles team that year had several future major leaguers, including Doug Flynn and Pat Zachry but most notably a 20-year-old named Joaquín Andújar.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before a sell-out crowd of 2,143, the Red Sox fell 12-8 despite a 2nd inning home run from a future Hall of Famer that eventually played left field for the Red Sox.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
