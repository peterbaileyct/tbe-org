<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s August and that means scholastic football is right around the corner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the public schools in Bristol are looking forward to the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central is coming off an impressive 9-2 campaign and with the CIAC’s expanded playoffs, the locals are hoping to earn another postseason berth – looking for its fourth postseason chance in school history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are going to play a few different teams this year as the schedule has been changed up a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New to this year’s schedule is Manchester (September 9), Enfield (September 30), Windsor (October 7), Maloney (October 21), Middletown (October 28), and old friends from New Britain (November 11).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney and Central squared off against one another in the playoffs in 2022 but will renew its rivalry during regular season competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a non-conference crossover game, Central travels to Wilton on September 23 at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s another rematch of sorts between the schools as the boys basketball and softball squads battled the Warriors’ programs over postseason play last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor (September 16) and Wethersfield (November 4) are the only two squads – along with crosstown rival Bristol Eastern – returning from last season’s slate of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers (4-6 in 2022) will also have a mix of old and new opponents to tackle over a busy schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM opens the year for Eastern and is a rematch from Week 2 last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That contest went down to the wire in 2021 and saw the Lancers hold on to win over a controversial 13-7 victory in Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then over the following three weeks, it’s a new slate of programs to battle in 2022 as Eastern travels to Platt (September 16), Avon (September 30), and Berlin (October 7) as most of the month of September will be played on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Lancers won’t compete a lick at home for about forty days between opponents on Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the bye week, the Lancers take a crack against neighbor Lewis Mills (October 21) before playing against a familiar squad to end October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville comes to the city limits on October 28, Bloomfield opens against the Lancers over the final month of the regular season (November 4) and there’s a special Saturday challenge at Farmington (November 12) the Kingstreeters will have to contend with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about the showdown against Bristol Central on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best part of the current CIAC listing for the Thanksgiving Day showdown between the Rams and Lancers on its website is the time and location of the annual crosstown event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the CIAC website, the contest is slated for 6:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving and scheduled to commence at Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect the game to take place at its usual 10:30 a.m. time slot from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s crossover game this season takes place on September 23 against Fairfield Warde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s home games this year commence at 6 p.m. every Friday night while Eastern’s starts its contests from Alumni Field at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
