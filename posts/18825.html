<p>PLAINVILLE - The Borry name is a very familiar one in the town of Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern boys soccer standout Ty Borry has plenty of family in town and this past Saturday, the senior had one of his best matches of the year against the program from Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a matinee showdown against the Blue Devils, Borry blasted in two goals as the Lancers scooped up an impressive 4-1 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win improved Eastern to 4-6-3 overall while Plainville - now at 6-5-1 - lost its first CCC South encounter of the year (4-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was moved from Thursday to Saturday as the teams battled under the warm October sun at Tinty Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borry dropped in his first score at 23:45, taking a Justin Sanchez Corner kick and knocking it in on the right side of the Plainville net to make it a 1-0 contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Plainville had a response as Trevor Rau knotted the match up about nine minutes later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rau drilled in a hard shot with 14:32 left to go over the first forty to make it a 1-1 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then with 1:59 remaining in the first half, the game-winning goal came and went.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Anthony Rogers took in an Eddie Ansah cross and tapped it neatly into the net, propelling the Lancers a 2-1 lead at halftime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We had strong pressure on the Plainville backs and they were unable to get their offense running smoothly," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; "Our offense was unselfish, finding numerous open men and connecting a string of passes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borry's second goal, coming ninety seconds into the second half, was the result of a smooth set of passes according to Sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah took a Liam Sanchez-Barreto clearance and found Connor Policarpio.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policarpio one-touched the ball to Justin Sanchez who quickly found Borry cutting on the left to the Plainville net.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An uncovered Borry then sent home a left-footed shot into the goal for a 3-1 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With less than 16 minutes to play, Eastern added a bit more of insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah took a Rio Fernandez long pass and beat the Plainville defense with a left-footed shot to the far side of the net for the Lancers' fourth goal and the final tally of 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville's goalie Austin Lausier made nine saves while Eastern's Peyton Cummings, the victorious keeper, scoped in eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern hosts Glastonbury on Monday at 3:45 p.m. as the Lancers continue to make their postseason push.</p>
