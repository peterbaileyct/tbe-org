<p>First baseman Isaiah Collazo led the Oxford Wolverines to a 7-2 win over St. Paul in Bristol yesterday at Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collazo was four for four with a double and two RBIs. Starter Quentin Glass picked up the win going three and two-thirds innings allowing two runs on three hits while striking out two. Reliever Nick Cerruto picked up the save allowing no hits over the final three and a third innings while striking out five. Coby Dagata took the loss for St. Paul.</p>

<p>After a scoreless top of the first inning, lead-off hitter Keaton Kroll got things going for St. Paul with a long double to left. Kroll moved to third on Cal Chance's fly out to deep center, and then scored on Coby Dagata's infield grounder.</p>

<p>Oxford tied things up quickly in the top of the second inning. Brando Fletter led off with a single to right, and advanced to second when Xavier Carlson laid down a sacrifice bunt. Collazo singled to right driving in Fletter, and the score was tied at 1.</p>

<p>Oxford took the lead in the top of the third inning. Cole O'Connell and Jake Matusovich had back-to-back singles to open the frame. After a sacrifice attempt by Tyler Bergoderi failed, Kyle Donlon doubled driving in Matusovich. Bergoderi scored on a passed ball, and Oxford led 3-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oxford again had back-to-back singles to open the top of the fourth inning, this time by Glass and Collazo. A sacrifice bunt by Ian Cunningham moved the runners over, and a sacrifice fly by O'Connell brought Glass home to make it 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul got one back in the bottom of the frame. With two outs, walks to Seth Meuer and Brian Anderson put two men on. An RBI single by Mike DeRosa brought home Meuer, and a walk to Jay DeRosa loaded the bases. Nick Cerreto relieved Glass on the mound, and got the final out to end the threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul would load the bases on walks in each of the next two innings, but in each case, they were unable to get the big hit to drive in any runs. Nick Cerreto worked out of bases loaded situations in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings without allowing a run to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the sixth with one out, Collazo collected his third single of the day. Cunningham and O'Connell walked to load the bases. After Matusovich was retired on a foul pop up, Bergoderi singled driving in two runs to make it 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oxford added an insurance run in the top of the seventh on back-to-back doubles by Cerreto and Collazo, and the final was 7-2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
