<p>BRISTOL - The strangest part of the season to date for the Bristol American Legion baseball program is the new zone the squad is competing in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to several teams around the state dropping out, Bristol’s original zone was down a couple programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gone are the days of Zone 1 play and Bristol’s showdowns against the likes of Terryville, Unionville, Avon ad Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2, along with Simsbury, Torrington and West Hartford, have moved on to Zone 3 - getting a chance to join a new portion of the league and start brand new rivalries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 3 is divided into two divisions: American and National, and those two leagues are made up of seven teams apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol and Simsbury have linked up in the American Division, joining Ellington, South Windsor, Middletown, Northeast and Tri-County.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not the easiest lineup to tangle with when it comes to a travel schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast competes in Tolland, Tri-County is based in Marlborough and Ellington is located right near Tolland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get your gas money ready for those driving adventures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol is going to be able to compete against any of these programs, eventually taking cracks against Torrington and West Hartford in the newly formed National Division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That division also includes RCP, Enfield, EHM, NCL Windsor Locks/Windsor and Glastonbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like Bristol will be traveling all over the globe to play this season, but Zone 3 is strong and the former Zone 1 programs will be a positive addition to the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Up-Coming Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, all of Bristol’s home games will be played from beautiful Muzzy Field - a treat for locals and the visiting's programs that venture to the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the battle against NCL on Friday, which is currently a 6-6 tie that will be concluded on another day, Post 2 is home for most of the following week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Sunday, Post 2 squares off against Simsbury (11 a.m.) as former Zone 1 programs collide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a double header on Monday when Northeast invades Bristol, starting at 5:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And scheduled for a 7:45 p.m. start is non-conference opponent Willimantic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, South Windsor comes to town (7 p.m.) and then to end the week on Friday, Bristol travels to Ellington (5:45 p.m.) for a big-time showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the play is heating up with plenty of action from Muzzy Field, and beyond, over the months of June and July.</p>
