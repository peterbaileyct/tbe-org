<p>The Registrars of Voters will begin mailing notifications to some residents whose polling place has changed as a result of redistricting. Redistricting takes place every 10 years based on the results of the census.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a resident's polling place has changed, the resident will receive an informational letter and magnet with their new polling location and precinct. The mailing should be completed by July 18. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Contact the Registrars of Voters Office with any questions, 860-584-6165.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access ten (10) articles per week.&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
