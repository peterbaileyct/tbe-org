<p><strong>AVON – The Bristol Eastern wrestling program opened its 2021-22 campaign on the road with a tough Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional bout against Avon on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And the Falcons were able to top the Lancers, nabbing a 59-24 victory from Avon high school.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It was the first meet for both programs since the pandemic gripped the world, cancelling the season last year for all the squads in the state.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>While the Eastern program (and debuting head coach Eric Sassu) battled throughout, Avon was able to secure nine pin-fall wins against the Kingstreeters.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>However, the Lancers did have standouts up and down the card.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>At 120 pounds, Eastern’s Michael Roalf just beat out the second period buzzer, pinning Avon’s Matt Mancini in 3:58.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And then at 152, bulldog Ella Nicholas proved that she is going to be one of the featured grapplers at that weight in the state – pinning Sawyer Hernandez (2:43) midway through the second stanza of action.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>At 160, Bristol Eastern football sensation Alex Marshall picked up right where he left off, downing Roel Johnson via pin-fall in 2:58.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And finally at 182 pounds, the Lancers’ Dylan Piazza pinned Chris Bourquin in 3:57 as the visiting aggression earned those 24 points on four pin-fall victories.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern held their own in other bouts as Andrew Brown (106 pounds) nearly forced overtime against Avon’s Owen White but fell in 5:57 via pin-fall while at 195, the Lancers’ Owen Broyles took Nils Jerger deep into the second period before being pinned at the 4:59 mark of the match.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Lancers have a full slate of action this Saturday as the program travels to Berlin for the annual CJ McCormack Tournament with a scheduled start time of 9 a.m.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next Wednesday, Eastern is back on the road in a CCC South challenge at Middletown (6 p.m.) and then to close out 2021 on December 29 at the ultra-competitive 34th Annual Ryan Sabbagh Danbury Holiday Wrestling Tournament.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>That holiday challenge commences at 9:30 a.m.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern opens its home portion of the season on Wednesday, January 5 against Enfield in a CCC Interdivisional tilt.</strong></p>
