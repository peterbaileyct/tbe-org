<p>Outside spring lead collection is held through the month of April, when the weather allows, according to an announcement from Public Works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residents are asked to bring leaf bags curbside as soon as they are filled and leave them curbside until collected. Leaf bag collection is available to all city residences eligible for curbside rubbish and recycling services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public Works advises that leaves are only collected in brown, recyclable, paper leaf bags that are available at most home and garden stores. There is no maximum limit to leaf bag collection at a residence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leaf bags containing dirt, sand, rocks, sod, or materials other than leaves will not be collected. Leaf bags must be placed curbside and not within the residence’s property for proper collection. Loose leaf piles will not be collected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leaves, grass, and twigs may also be taken by residents to the City of Bristol Solid Waste Transfer Station. At the Transfer Station, leaves, grass, and twigs in bags (other than paper yard waste bags) must be emptied out. A&nbsp;<a href="http://ct-bristol2.civicplus.com/237/Transfer-Station">Transfer Station Permit&nbsp;</a>is required to access the Transfer Station.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, to leaf collection, residents are encouraged to clear leaves and other debris from the tops of catch basins abutting their property to help prevent localized flooding conditions. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
