<p><strong>How to remember a person’s first name</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past two weeks, I’ve thought of a person, a past friend, celebrity, athlete or whomever. This usually takes place at night after I go to bed and toss and turn. Well, the names I finally recalled were done with a new procedure I put in place. One example was Tom Burns, a one-time coach of the Bristol American Legion baseball team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started with A. Burns to see if that started something: Art Burns, Andy Burns, Al Burns, etc. I then went to “B” with the process and when I got to “T,” Tom blurted out in my mind. Again, this has worked for me five-out-of-five times. Try it some time. No charge here!</p>

<p><strong>BEHS ‘62 reunion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The kids who graduated from Bristol Eastern in 1962 will be holding an 80th Birthday Reunion on Sept. 20 of this year at the Wood and Tap on Rt. 4 in Farmington from 1-4 p.m. There will be food stations with plenty<em> of</em> food, slides and fun. Price is $45. Call Marge Tessman at 860-582-7780.</p>

<p>The class of ‘63 will also be doing an 80th next year. A new trend?</p>

<p><strong>Albion J. Moquin (1941 - 2024)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was saddened when I read Albion’s obituary on Monday. A member of the class of ‘61 at Bristol Eastern, he set the high jump record at the school. My connection is that I broke his mark, and he also had a brother and sister of his in my class, John and Judy. I also carpooled to work with their younger, Jan, afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Names</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robbie Fields-Soucy, retired park department worker, took on his wife’s maiden name when they married. So, I’m wondering if Bob Kalat’s wife, Patti, was a Kalat before getting hitched to Bob. He’d be Bob Kalat-Kalat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this, Bob would introduce himself to others as Bob Kalat-Kalat, and the person Bob is talking to would think he had a stutter. Oh, I’m so bad, hang in there with<em> me! (P.S. My</em> personal nickname for Patti is Debbie.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My late friend Bev Strong could sign her name as B(e) Strong, of which she was. A dedicated wife to the late Ralph, a Bristol tennis icon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don Goranson was using the pen name of Don Gordon while working up the Bristol Press ladder to become its editor. I was going to use Robert W. Montgomery as my writing name, before choosing Bob Montgomey. Robert W. here sounded too uppity.</p>

<p>Channel 3 had a short segment on the UConn football team for this coming season with the coach and one player being interviewed. The player was third-year starter Victor Rosa from Bristol. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
