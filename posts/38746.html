<p>BRISTOL - Every girls scholastic basketball program needs a player like Bristol Eastern’s Lauren Ayotte.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know the type: invested in the program, does a little of everything, and while she’s not the star player, Ayotte does whatever it takes to snatch victory from defeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to date, the senior has helped the Kingstreeters go 2-0, off to a tremendous start to the 2023-24 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lauren Ayotte, from the beginning of the season to now has been the glue of this team,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “She plays hard every day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte’s numbers don’t jump off the page, but her impact is felt in every game none-the-less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, Ayotte averages 2.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte doesn’t look for her own offense as her job is to get others on the squad into the offensive groove, such as screening for Autumn Udoh, or passing the ball off to Vanessa Drury for an open 3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel has been the recipient of several dishes by Ayotte and she’s been helping to guide a host of talented freshmen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s nothing flashy about her game once you see her operate on the court as she’s a bit of a throwback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One night, Ayotte’s guarding one of the best players in the state like she did in the 79-51 win over Tiara Tyson and Manchester on opening night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On another night, an Eastern triumph over Avon (41-39), Ayotte posted a career-high 11 rebounds while setting several quality picks and screens for her teammates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offense is glamorous but her job, which provides plenty of support off the ball, isn’t so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it truly doesn’t matter to the third year varsity contributor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s a hard worker,” said Floyd. “She’s that blue collar worker. She makes some shots, she gets rebounds, she plays the best player defensively and she hits big shots.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the good things about Ayotte is she doesn’t try to play too much above her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, even if she ever does, there’s nothing wrong with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that nail bitter against Avon, Ayotte attempted a late outside jumper -- a great sign for her because if she can hit one or two of those shots a game, everything on the court will open up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And her effort against Manchester of five points, three rebounds and five assists speaks volumes of all the little things she does on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are there more talented players swirling around Ayotte on a nightly basis?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course but Ayotte is such a big picture player, all that other stuff is simply just white noise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte has helped fuel the chemistry on the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team over the years and her role is as invaluable as it gets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every team would welcome Ayotte’s poise, leadership and timely contributions in a heartbeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t say enough about her because she just does all those little things that you don’t get credit for,” said Floyd.&nbsp;</p>
