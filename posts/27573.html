<p>MIDDLETOWN - The Senior American Legion Baseball program from RCP &nbsp;has been a thorn in the side of Bristol over the last decade or so – especially in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Thursday night, the 17U teams from both programs squared off from Xavier High School in regular season action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the score wasn’t even close as Post 2 ripped up a huge 22-5 victory over RCP to move to 6-0 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win propelled Bristol to first place in the Zone 3 standings while RCP dropped to 2-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of scoring, Post 2 actually trailed out the gate by a 1-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, RCP allowed Bristol to score runs over innings two though five with disastrous results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 zipped up eight runs in the second stanza, a half-dozen more in the third, one over the fourth and when Bristol scooped up seven runs in the fifth to seize its tremendous 22-run push, the showdown was all but over.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five players from the Mum City had multi-hit games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White (six RBI) and Brian Grabowski (two RBI) each tallied three hits while Caleb Simard, Drew Martineau (four RBI) and Mason Harris (five RBI) all added two hits apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Colvin, Jonathan Montgomery and Tate Stevens each blasted out a hit to pace the Bristol offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the game, Bristol batted .405 (15-of-37) while on the flip side, RCP just couldn’t solve Post 2’s pitching staff despite a four-run fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery won the contest for Bristol over three innings and threw just 57 pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colvin and Caleb Molinsky also threw an inning apiece for the winners as Bristol remained undefeated to that point of the campaign..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>On Friday, Bristol completed its suspended game against Tri-County which was stuck at 8-8 before darkness shutdown it down after seven innings. The game was completed at East Hampton High School as Tri-County had a runner on first base. A botched pickoff play sent the man to third and moments later, a passed ball the runner as Bristol fell for the first time this season by a 9-8 final. Post 2 ended the night at 6-1 and had, going into the top of the seventh, an 8-5 lead over Tri-County before three runs foiled the game.</p>
