<p>After a tremendous start to the Connecticut American Legion Baseball 17U campaign in 2023, the squad from Bristol hit a bit of a rough patch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of that was due to call-ups to the Senior level, injuries caught the team a bit and just general bad luck stalled out the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 ended up 11-8 overall but that meant the locals were going to be in the postseason mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even after losing its first game of the 17U State Tournament this past Tuesday, eleventh ranked Bristol bounced right back - riding its pitching to the Connecticut Super Regional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the program is one of the final eight teams left standing - one of several from Zone 3, Bristol’s home division - in the state with most of its pitching eligible to throw starting on Monday from Pat Kinney Field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How far can Post 2 go in the Connecticut Super Regional?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the sky is the limit for this outstanding group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol went 2-1 to start postseason play</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 just couldn’t get a hit in its opening round loss against No. 6 Milford last Tuesday night, falling 2-0 from Jonathan Law High School in Milford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol squad allowed two unearned runs and just couldn't tally a hit that would have made all the difference in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Jonathan Montgomery went the distance for Bristol, throwing 95 pitches and stayed in the game until the very end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the tournament was a double elimination format and Post 2 was in it to win it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days later, this time from the friendly confines of Muzzy Field, Bristol eliminated 14th ranked RCP by a 11-1 mercy ruled final over six frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky won the game on the hill for Post 2, needing only 2.2 innings worth of work to keep RCP off the board for most of the encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was a 7-0 contest before Brian Grabowski, Drew Martineau and Jack Erickson all joined the party on the mound, keeping Molinsky ready to pitch this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the plate, Gabe White (2-for-3, two runs), Molinsky (2-for-4, two RBI), Tate Stevens (3-for-3, four RBI) and Grabowski (two hits) all produced something to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Bristol scooped in 14 total hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as Stamford defeated Milford that same night, it led to a winner-take-all mega event on Friday evening with a rematch between Bristol against Milford on the road - both 1-1 in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, with the rain holding off just enough, Post 2 was able to zip up a huge 6-5 win over Milford from the beautiful field at Jonathan Law High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scooped up six runs in the top of the third tilt and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Gavin Colvin dishing from the hill, Milford ended up playing catch-up the entire evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Milford might have finished the contest on a 5-0 jaunt, but it wasn’t enough to spoil an amazing complete game effort by Colvin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went the full seven innings, using just 87 pitches, as Post 2 moved on in tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 17U Regional Tournament bracket was not set in stone as of Sunday morning with the Tri-County/Waterford showdown still hanging in the balance on Sunday due to Friday’s wet weather in most parts of the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the bracket is split into two groupings: Region A and Region B.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is lumped with Torrington, Farmington - all members of Zone 3. - along with Naugatuck to make up the Regional B bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games from this division will be played from Pat Kidney Field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol and Naugatuck were the two squads that advanced from Pod C competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of the bracket, the winner of Tri-County/Waterford links up with West Hartford, South Windsor and Danbury in the Regional A grouping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those contests will be contested from Rotary Field in South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The adventures don’t end</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol battles Torrington to open the regional on Monday at 4:30 p.m. in the double elimination fray from Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, midway through the season, those two squads were battling for the Zone 3 championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 38 ended up winning the zone with a ledger of 15-3-2, scoring 150 runs this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2, at 11-8, finished 4.5 games behind the division leader in seventh place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams were 1-1 against each other this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 17, Bristol shutout Torrington by a 2-0 final from Riley Field while in the rematch (July 8), Post 2 dropped a tough 15-7 decision to Post 38, also from Riley Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol led 7-1 after two innings in the second showdown but the squad simply ran out of gas in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Win or lose against the Zone 3 winner, Bristol will be back in action at either 4:30 or 7 p.m. on Tuesday, depending on Monday’s results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winners will advance into Thursday and Championship Friday will determine which program advances to the state finals.</p>
