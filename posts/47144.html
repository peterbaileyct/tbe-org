<p>I received a phone call from Tom Shopay last Saturday. Tom and I are friends who were classmates at both Stafford and Bristol Eastern High schools here. We have these chats a few times a year, and we enjoy talking about kids from the past we sometimes still see. Among them are cousins Neil Fries and Tom Zipp. Tom has seen each in Florida.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our connections with these two are special and family members of each cross paths here, whether it be at the golf course, real estate or what have you. Tom Shopay’s brother, Dave, incidentally, lives only 30 minutes from him. Dave was a stalwart in baseball, too.</p>

<p>Other folks we recalled were Howard Anderson, Steve Sergey, Paul Witkowski and others. Some were neighborhood friends here, Forestville Little League players at the field off King Street. Then there’s the late Sam Schular who had the little store down the street, where he would give an ice cream popsicle to any Forestville Little Leaguer who hit a home run that day. A soft-hitting right fielder who saw a lot of strikes go by him, I never earned one Mr. Anderson, now a Dr. Anderson, whiffed me many times as a hurler for the Forestville Little League Indians, a team that his pal Tom Shopay also played for.</p>

<p><strong>This and that</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was correct last week when I wrote that Dan Hurley would stay with UConn. If he ever goes to the NBA, wouldn’t it be something if Donovan Clingan was a member of his team. I recall years ago when the late Celtic’s coach and guard K.C. Jones was here singing at the Carousel Museum. He was married to Bristol High graduate Ellen Della Bitta. Her brother, David, was the center of the 1962 Bristol Eastern basketball team, state champions that year under Burr Carlson, a former UConn standout.</p>

<p><strong>Harwinton</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the towns bordering Bristol is Harwinton, edged between Plymouh and Burlington. It was founded in 1737 and its name comes from the words Hartford and Windsor with the addition of “ton” as in town. It’s a quiet area and there are many buildings showcasing its past. A drive down Rt. 4 and the surrounding area is a pleasant one.</p>

<p><strong>Virginia Rodgers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I received a birthday call from former Bristol Press co-worker Virginia Rodgers and that was a pleasant surprise. Now long retired and living in Florida, she was up here for a mini-class reunion. I’m sure that those who crossed paths with her at the newspaper realized that she was a “sweetie.” Her call last week made my day.</p>

<p><strong>Don Zurell</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don, a former supervisor of maintenance at Hartford Hospital, is on the board of directors at the Bristol Historical Society. A 1964 graduate of Bristol Eastern, he’s an easy-going problem solver who is a true gentleman. He’s done me many favors through the years.</p>

<p><strong>Remembering Tony Savino</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tony, who left us some years ago, did a lot for Bristol. In fact, the bridge entering Rt. 72 highway once known as Pine Street in Forestville, is named in his honor. I know I recall him as I pass over the bridge, and hope others do too. His widow, Deanna Savino, recently passed away. Tony’s contributions of time included the Army National Guard, city government and sports.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
