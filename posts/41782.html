<p id="isPasted">Liens will be placed on all outstanding real estate taxes for the Grand List 2022 beginning March 1, according to City of Bristol Tax Collector, Ann Bednaz in a release announcing the deadlines. These liens will be placed on the City of Bristol Land Records March 1. Real Estate taxes became delinquent after Feb. 1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Payments may be made in person no later than Feb. 29, at 111 North Main Street or postmarked no later than Feb. 29, by United States Postal Service mail. Mail payments to the Tax Collector’s Office, P.O. Box 1040, Bristol, CT 06011-1040.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residents may view taxes and/or make a payment online at: <a href="http://www.bristolct.gov/">www.bristolct.gov</a>, under "Quick Links," "Pay Online," "Tax Payments."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If real estate taxes are not paid but are included in an escrow payment, the office recommends contacting the mortgage company immediately.</p>

<p>When liens are placed on a property, it prevents properties from being transferred or sold. Taxes must also be paid in full before building permits may be issued.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
