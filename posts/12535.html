<p> Wheeler Clinic announced today that it has received a $100,000 gift supporting its campaign for a new health center in Bristol, as well as numerous programs benefiting students at Northwest Village School in Plainville.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The gift is from the estate of Hall "Cap" Adams, Jr., a longtime philanthropic investor in Wheeler’s work. Adams passed away in Illinois in June 2020 after a notable and generous life, including a nationally recognized career in advertising. Working with his estate, two priorities quickly emerged that honored his life’s legacy and passion for providing others with opportunities for good health and quality education.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Half of Adams’ gift supports Wheeler’s fundraising campaign in Bristol, helping to fund the construction of a new community health center and administrative headquarters. <br></p>

<p>The other half will support students at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wheelerclinic.org/your-student/northwest-village-school" target="_blank">Northwest Village School (NVS)</a> in Plainville, a therapeutic day school serving students K-12th grade and a post-graduation transition program for students up to age 21. At NVS, Cap’s legacy will carry on through an outdoor fitness trail for students, as well as through the Samuel Marszycki Scholarship, which supports graduating seniors pursuing post-secondary education.</p>

<p> Finally, the gift supports the Basic Needs Fund at the school, which provides immediate help for the basic needs of life for students and their families, providing support that is not available through other means.  </p>

<p>“Cap’s life was devoted to helping others achieve educational and health goals,” said Sabrina Trocchi, PhD, MPA, Wheeler’s president and CEO. “We’re honored that his legacy lives on in our work helping patients stay healthy and well and helping students and their families thrive. It’s the perfect representation of what he lived for.”</p>
