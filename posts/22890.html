<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central wrestling program got the better of its counterparts from Bristol Eastern on Wednesday evening, securing a 40-31 city series win, as the showdown was in doubt until the final match results were tallied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s all you can ask for over an exciting night of action between the two tremendous programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Coming into it, we knew we were banged up, missing guys,” said Central coach Matt Boissonneault. “[Eastern’s] banged up, missing guys. You know in a rivalry match, not just who you’re wrestling, [but] you know exactly what they do and how they wrestle. On both sides, it made matches closer, individual bouts closer than maybe it looked like on paper. But that’s why it’s fun and that’s why before we came in, I told the kids to enjoy the experience because they work hard and usually most of the wrestling - the hard work [they] do - and even the competition isn’t in front of a gym [atmosphere] like this.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve privileged to have that opportunity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To close the meet, which the home team was winning by three points (34-31), Central’s Julian Colon (126) ended up pinning Alex Szynal in 3:15 to turn a slim three-point match into a 40-31 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the result could have swung the other way had Eastern (6-9 overall) could have stolen some of the swing matches against Central (10-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a great, great match,” said Eastern coach Todd Krolikowski. “We knew it was going to be tight. I’m very proud of everybody. I’m very proud of all our wrestlers. Every match was great. There were no dull moments in that entire bout.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All 14 matches were great.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start things off, Eastern’s Michael Roalf ended up getting the better of Connor Kish via a 14-4 major decision but the Central grappler, battling a crazy nosebleed, refused to yield as the bout went the full six minutes - setting the tone of the evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Kish] busted his nose a minute into the match,” said Boissonneault. “He was bleeding, we gave him a mask, he was bleeding more, he was going [and] that set the tone right there. And we said [to the team] ‘if the rest of you don’t want it as badly as Connor does, then we’re not going to get it done.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Even though we lost that match, that was probably one of the key matches.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central then picked up consecutive wins as Derek Sedlak (138) pinned Gianluca Morello in just over three minutes while Landon Dionne (145) was able to earn a pin-fall victory over feisty Joshua Aubin in 1:58.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Landon Dionne, he’s our senior captain, and he’s one of the top wrestlers in the state,” said Boissonneault. “He was wrestling one of Eastern’s more experienced wrestlers and to get a pin there was big.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then at 152, Central grappler Lincoln Archibald (152) was pushed to the limit against Rocco Barbino.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald led 6-0 eight seconds into the second period but Barbino just kept battling - trimming the deficit to 6-5 going into the third and final tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lincoln wouldn’t let Barbino escape over the final two minutes as the Rams earned a big 6-5 decision to push up a 15-4 edge in the match.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everybody knows what you’re doing [and] he got caught in a bad position,” said Boissonneault of Archibald. “He fought off his back and still won a close match.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in a competitive showdown at 160, Eastern’s Ryan Zavecz and Central’s Ayden Pratt battled into the third period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a late takedown by Zavecz, the grappler pinned Pratt (5:01) with just under a minute remaining in regulation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You can see his growth,” said Krolikowski of Ryan Zavecz. “He wrestled [Pratt] at the BC Tournament at the beginning of the year, one of the first tournaments we had. He was losing 9-2 to the kid and he ended up pining him the first time. So, he had the confidence, he knew he could go out there and wrestle hard and he had control of that match the entire time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Jayden Colon (170) topped Jaiden Fore over a 9-1 major decision and then Eastern’s Adam Zavecz (180) needed just forty seconds to pin Jomar Lopez - trimming the deficit to 19-16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He went out there and did his job,” said Krolikowski of Adam Zavecz. “Obviously, the two brothers, who grew up and love the sport, I’m very proud of both of them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Johnny Rios (195) was leading Owen Broyles 7-2 midway through the second frame before securing the pin in 3:44 as the Rams scooped up a 25-16 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Johnny Rios, he wrestled another quality wrestler,” said Boissonneault. “He knew what his opponent was good at. He stayed away from those positions and got the pin.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Rio Fernandez (220) beat the first period horn with a pin in 1:56 over Esteban Vazquez while at 285, Central’s Andrew Sarkis won via pin in 1:26 over Nuon Sovannara as the home team led by nine once again (31-22).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 106, Eastern’s Soph Um was a forfeit victor without an opponent to face and quickly, Eastern was trailing by just three points once again (31-28).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then at 113, Central’s Kaden Dragon ended up shutting out Andrew Brown by a 5-0 decision but did not make it easy while the showdown at 120 went to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Luke Viens - fighting a scoreless match 5:30 in - was able to snare a huge takedown on Joseph Niek 30 seconds remaining, holding on to an eventual 2-1 decision as the deficit in the match was chopped to 34-31 with one bout to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Luke is very aggressive,” said Krolikowski of Viens. “He was trying to do more, and I know he wanted the pin and he wanted to do more. [Niek] did a great job keeping the match tight and slowing it down and tying him up. It was a good match.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know he’s a little disappointed that he didn’t win by more or get the pin, but he did a good job. He’s only a sophomore and he’ll be a star here for the next couple of years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to zip up the win, Colon (126) earned the pinfall win over Szynal as the Rams held off the Lancers for a 40-31 victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Really, up and down the line-up, wins and losses, I was happy the way we performed,” said Boissonneault of Central.</p>
