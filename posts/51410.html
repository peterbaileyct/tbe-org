<p>The Carousel Museum is set to host the "Girls in STEAM" event next month, inviting young women and girls to explore their potential in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM).&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The Girls in STEAM event integrates STEAM with the historical and artistic significance of carousels," education manager Bonnie Plourde said. “This idea is in perfect line with the Museum’s educational mission, and carousels are more than just pretty figures."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"By highlighting the complex engineering and craftsmanship behind these beautiful machines, attendees will walk away with an appreciation of the value of preserving these one-of-a-kind pieces of cultural history," she said.&nbsp;"We also hope to inspire a new generation to study STEAM and cultural arts fields in unique and diverse ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants will engage in a variety of interactive activities designed to highlight the fun and practical applications of STEAM. Planned activities include creative arts projects, engineering challenges, interactive science experiments and mathematical games.</p>

<p>A special demonstration by the Bristol Fire Department will feature the mechanics of firetrucks. Each participant will receive a diploma at the end of the event to celebrate their accomplishments and encourage further exploration in STEAM disciplines.</p>

<p>‘I think guests will enjoy the hands-on and collaborative activities! Learning with friends is always more fun," she said. “We can’t wait to see everyone at The Carousel Museum; where learning becomes an exhilarating ride.”</p>

<p>Girls in STEAM will take place on Sunday, Oct. 13, from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Carousel Museum, located at 95 Riverside Ave. The free event is sponsored by the Women and Girls Fund at the Main Street Community Foundation and aims to ignite interest in STEAM fields among attendees.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
