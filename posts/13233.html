<p>The Bristol Eastern softball squad is suddenly on fire, winning four straight contests as tournament time approaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just as quickly, the Lancers have become road warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The streak continued on Friday as Eastern dropped Plainville by a 12-3 final in a CCC South bout from the Blue Devils’ softball turf diamond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an offensive show by the Kingstreeters as Sam Policki etched up four hits to lead the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace D’Amato sent a ball over the fence in Plainville for her third homer of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also added two hits while Janessa Gonzalez, Ashley Serafin, Emily Valentine, and Alex Shorette all etched up multiple hits to defeat the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ pitching sensation, Ali Tellier, collected 15 strikeouts to earn the win. Off that outstanding performance, Tellier has fanned over 300 batters for her career at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, the Lancers were leading 9-0 over the Blue Devils and the Kingstreeters never relented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, who was 5-7 after a tough 3-1 loss at Bristol Central back on May 6, are now 9-7 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The previous day, the Lancers sent non-conference challenger Pomperaug packing over an 8-2 triumph from the Thunderdome on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette had a hit and two RBI, Jazmyn Brown tallied three hits and scored twice while Gonzalez nabbed a couple hits and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Eastern has a chance to visit the pay window four times as the locals battle Lewis Mills on Monday in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, it’s three straight contests from King Street to wrap up the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, Manchester comes to town for a CCC Interdivisional showdown and then Wednesday sees Maloney invade the softball field at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, its city series time and a chance for Eastern to draw even with Bristol Central this year - attempting to split the season series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All four games commence at 3:45 p.m.</p>
