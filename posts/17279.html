<p>Golfers, sponsors, and volunteers took part in Wheeler's 37th Annual Golf Classic, presented by<br>Mutual of America Financial Group, on September 14 at The Country Club of Farmington, and the event grossed an unprecedented $100,000 to support individuals and families in care through Wheeler's Basic Needs Fund.<br><br>The total amount raised through this event is more than $1.3 million since its inception in 1986.<br><br>"We're so humbled by the overwhelming support of our event sponsors, donors, players, and volunteers, without whom we could not meet the most basic needs of the individuals and families we serve," said Sabrina Trocchi, PhD, MPA, president and chief executive officer, Wheeler.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As economic challenges persist, we must continue to support our most vulnerable populations with items such as food, clothing, transportation, linkage to services, and by addressing other factors<br>that interfere with our patients' health and well-being," Trocchi added.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler's Basic Needs Fund addresses a range of environmental and social factors that interfere with a patient's health and well-being, but which are not addressed by other means of funding. This fund allows the organization's community health workers to address environmental conditions in homes, neighborhoods, and communities of Family Health &amp; Wellness Center patients, which might lead to poor health outcomes. It also provides resources to address basic needs such as food, transportation, clothing, shelter, medications, or other items or activities that cannot be accessed through a patient's own resources and/or community-based programs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2018, the Basic Needs Fund has supported more than 5,500 patients and families with immediate, responsive help to meet basic needs. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
