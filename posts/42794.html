<p>The topic of geese management on Memorial Boulevard will be discussed at the Board of Park Commissioners meeting on this Wednesday, March 20 at 6 p.m. at City Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Park Superintendent Joshua Medeiros, geese management on the Boulevard has been an on-going challenge and over the years a number of methods have been tried that have proven unsuccessful in the long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These include employing fake swans and initiating a management program that involved addling the eggs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The topic has been recently re-introduced at the Parks Board and they are exploring a variety of approaches, in consultation with the State of Connecticut DEEP (Department of Energy and Environmental Protection) up to and including a round-up program. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Wednesday's meeting, Medeiros is anticipating more discussion and potentially a vote on a direction but explained that no action would be taken until a geese management plan is developed and adopted by the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parks Board Chairperson Bob Fiorito agreed with Medeiros that up to now, no effective strategy has been found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As you know everyone wants to find a solution. At times, you can't walk the boulevard,” Fiorito said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fiorito described a program which is done with the approval from state DEEP that gives the city a permit to hire a company that comes in and rounds the geese up and humanely euthanizes them, after which the geese are then used for food. <br><br>This approach is supposed to be effective because geese only come back to where they were born. <br><br>The Board had discussions at last month’s meeting, but Fiorito stated that he is doubtful there is the will to endure the public outcry that this approach would cause by some in the community.</p>

<p> “I believe the state is looking for a community willing to try,” said the board chair.</p>
