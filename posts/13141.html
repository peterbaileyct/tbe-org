<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball squad never got into its game against Rocky Hill on Monday, suffering a 9-5 setback in a CCC Interdivisional contest from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocky Hill moved to 10-4 over the winning effort while Eastern dropped to 3-8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Terriers led 9-0 through six innings, eventually holding on for the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers flipped up five runs in the bottom of the seventh to make things interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern was foiled by allowing 10 walks and four hit batters, committing a half-dozen errors, and a balk that led to several runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the game, Rocky Hill tallied only six hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conor McCormick and Elliot Norris led the Eastern offense with two hits apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocky Hill starting pitcher Ben Centurelli pitched a strong six innings, allowing only three singles and eight strikeouts with no walks to earn the win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern chucker Anthony Nocera started for the Lancers, giving up two runs in the first frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the bases loaded, an error scored a run and a base-on-balls forced in the other, making it a 2-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless second stanza, the Terriers scooped up a couple in the third inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two Eastern infield errors, sandwiched around a single, saw the bases loaded once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nocera hit a batter that scored a run, making way for reliever Ben D’Amato to take the hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He walked the next batter to force in a second run, and then etched up three strikeouts to end the third - propelling Rocky Hill to a 4-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato did not allow any additional offense in the fourth and fifth frames but in the sixth, the Terriers went for five more runs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk, a double, and two singles led to two more runs for Rocky Hill, making it a 6-0 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Kyle Babin then came into pitch, issuing a walk and hit a batter for the third run of the frame, making it 7-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris relived Babin, walking the first two batters for two additional runs and a 9-0 deficit ensued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the seventh, the first seven Eastern batters reached base against Centurelli.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A double by Ryan Maglio, a single from Mike Roalf, and a walk loaded the bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCormick smashed out an RBI single, Jaydon Churchill added an RBI walk, and an RBI single by Cole Latko chopped the deficit to 9-3 with more runs to come.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On more RBI base hit, this time by Norris, ended Centurelli's day on the mound with Rocky Hill leading 9-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Carlstrom relieved Centurelli, retiring the final three batters and allowing a single run, as Eastern lost by a 9-5 final.&nbsp;</p>
