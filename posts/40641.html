<p>The verdict is still out, but the eagle that had been stolen earlier in December and replaced subsequently through a donation, is missing a wing either from damage sustained in a snowstorm or through mischief, according to American Legion Post 209 commander Brian Avery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Unfortunately, in early parts of January 2024 during the snowstorm either the eagle was vandalized again or snow fell on the wing and broke their wing off," Avery said. "American Legion Post 209 is looking into the cost of fixing the wing. If the wing could be fixed it will be replaced if not the eagle will be removed."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 209 has played a significant role in renovating the Quinlan Park where the eagle sits atop a monument honoring veterans from Bristol and Forestville and surrounding cities and towns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in December 2023 the monument was vandalized and the original eagle stolen. It was replaced on Dec. 22, 2023, through a donation from the Pepin Steel, which provided the original monument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the rededication of the eagle and the Veterans Memorial Bell, the family of the late Alan Pepin, a principal with Pepin Steel and designer and manufacturer of the monument were among the honorees. Pepin Steel and its workers donated and installed the replacement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avery said the Post could not keep replacing the eagle or fixing it, either after being vandalized or damaged. The Post has the damaged wing in its possession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are considering our options at this point," he said, "and we'll move forward with the best decision for everyone shortly."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
