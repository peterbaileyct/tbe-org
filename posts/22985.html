<p>A couple of Bristol Eastern’s finest alumni were busy down in Washington DC last week.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn sophomores Tyler Martin and Jack Stavens partnered with three other business school students for the Kogod Case Competition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group had to create a business plan for Chaia Tacos in the Georgetown section of Washington DC.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to its website, ‘Chaia is an unconventional shop serving insanely delicious tacos’ which seemed like a delicious prospect for the crew from Connecticut to tackle.</p>
