<p>BRISTOL – A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the Bristol and Northeast Senior American Legion baseball squads actually got their game in on Monday evening – and an ultimate victor was determined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it didn’t go down that way in Bristol yesterday as rain disrupted, and ultimately postponed the game between the squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast was leading 7-0 through three completed frames and the contest will be completed on another day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of Bristol’s 19U games have been foiled this season, including a 6-6 tie against NCL that will continue into the 11<sup>th</sup> inning when play resumes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast (currently 2-0) was aggressive from the start, nabbing three runs in the first inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Giluly brought home Jared Wilhelm via a double and two outs later, Mason Wilson singled in Giluly – making it a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And an RBI single by Andrew McGann pushed Bristol’s deficit to 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with the bases loaded, Bristol pitcher Declan Schenck struck out Attley Stevens to end the threat with Post 2 coming to the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Elliot Norris started the bottom of the first by jamming an infield hit to deep shortstop as the home team attempted to respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris stole second with one away but never advanced as Northeast was quickly back at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors went for another three-pack of runs in the second stanza as an RBI single from Joseph Keene, a run-scoring groundout by Diego Mercado and a double off the bat of Wilson scored Keane to give Northeast a 6-0 edge through one-and-a-half frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isaac Roberge took over on the hill for Schenck in the third tilt as the rain was steadily falling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After two quick outs and a single by Wilhelm, an offering by Giluly was misplayed in left field as the lead runner scored to push the Northeast lead to 7-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the third, Bristol’s EJ Sanchez dropped in a one-out base hit to left but never advanced as a rain delay stalled out the game at 6:43 p.m. with Post 2 still trailing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About 30 minutes later, the game was called and the showdown will be completed on another date, at another time, perhaps in another galaxy far, far away (a.k.a. Tolland).</p>
