<p>BURLINGTON – After a tough two-pack of games against Middletown and Southington, it was time for the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team to get back to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Thursday night in Burlington, it was collection time for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led four points after one period of play – never looking back – as the Kingstreeters downed the Spartans by a 42-25 final from the Thunderdome on the campus of Lewis Mills High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams moved to 2-2 on the campaign as Eastern won on the road for the second time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals are 2-1 away from home this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three players scored in double-figures for the Lancers as Taigan Parent dropped in a game-high 11 points while Vanessa Drury and Autumn Udoh each chipped in 10 for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No player ended up in double figures for Mills. Cassie Martinotti&nbsp;sunk in eight for the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the first period, Udoh drained a three-point bomb at the buzzer to propel the Lancers to a two-possession edge at 10-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills just couldn’t get things moving offensively early in the second stanza and when Parent hit a hoop, coupled with a charity toss by the Spartans, it was a 12-7 score one minute in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither team netted a point over the following four minutes but a Drury hoop, followed by a trifecta by Parent, gave the Lancers a 19-11 edge at halftime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills trimmed the deficit to 19-14 at the 6:20 mark of the third period before Eastern put the thing away for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 13-0 push by the Lancers saw Udoh notching seven of those points while Drury hit a couple buckets that gave the visiting aggression a 32-15 cushion going into the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams netted 10 fourth quarter points over mop-up duty as the Lancers squared up a big 17-point win to get back to .500 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back in action in one week’s time as the Lancers will be home for a huge non-conference tilt against St. Joseph at 5 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game opens a string of four consecutive home contests for Eastern from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
