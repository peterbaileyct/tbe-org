<p>WEST HARTFORD - Friday afternoon was a tough time for the Bristol Eastern baseball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers took a quick 2-0 edge over Northwest Catholic in the top of the third frame, but the Lions came rip-roaring back with 14 unanswered runs as Northwest wrangled up a 14-2 CCC Interdivisional victory over Eastern in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was called due to the mercy rule as the Lancers fell to 2-3 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest improved to 3-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern managed only three hits in the contest, led by a double from Elliot Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singles by Owen Myers and Jaydon Churchill were the other hits for the Eastern program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D'Amato started on the hill for Eastern, walking four and hitting one batter in 2.2 innings of work to draw the loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest pitcher Jonah Balcarak chucked five innings for the win, yielding three hits, two runs - just one earned - fanning five and walking one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was a scoreless game through two frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Lancers nabbed that 2-0 edge, NWC score six times in the bottom of the third and tallied eight additional runs in the fourth to make it a 14-2 blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern made a real go of it in the top of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris led off with his double to right center, Cole Latko walked, and both runners moved up a base on a wild pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris eventually came home on a groundout and Latko scored the Lancers second run on an infield error - making it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the bottom of the third, Northwest took over for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vinny Maslauskas homered over the left field fence for the first run - chopping the deficit in half. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single by Riley Caron, who went to third on a wild pickoff attempt, later scored to tie the game on Erin Curtiss's single inside first base, making it 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a walk, followed by a single from Ethan Porter, notched the go-ahead run at 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error loaded the bases for the Lions and Caleb Molinsky came in to pitch for D'Amato. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Balcarak hit Molinsky's first pitch for a bases clearing double to deep left as Northwest etched up a 6-2 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, the Lions batted around, sending 12 batters to the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest zipped up five hits, taking advantage of two Eastern errors, two walks, and three wild pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And DH Tyler Worley belted out a grand slam over the left field fence to ice the contest - leading to the 14-2 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was immediately back in action the following day as the Lancers traveled to Lewis Mills for a CCC South tilt.</p>
