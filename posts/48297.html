<p>For the third consecutive year, the Bristol Girls Little League Softball’s Senior League squad captured the Connecticut state championship, rolling to a 20-0 triumph over Ledyard in the title game Thursday evening. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol will represent the state next week in the Eastern Regional, which will be held in&nbsp;Worcester, Mass.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s long-term consistency and dedication stands out as its key to success, according to coach Adam Whitlock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think their&nbsp;longevity speaks for itself,” Whitlock said.&nbsp;“These are kids who have been playing here since they were four, five, six years old. They have&nbsp;all&nbsp;the options in the world to play anywhere else, yet they choose to play with each other and come back here. Their success is mainly due to the&nbsp;teamwork&nbsp;and the real care and respect they have for one another, and the hard work they’ve put in for the last 11, 12 years.”</p>

<p>In the finale, Bristol quickly gained control, scoring 13 runs in the top of the first and cruising from there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooklynne Whitlock went 3-for-3 with&nbsp;an RBI&nbsp;and a walk. She was dominant in the circle, allowing just one hit and striking out eight to earn the win.&nbsp;Whitlock also threw a shutout in the round prior, striking out 12 in a 12-0 win over the same Ledyard team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Beebe smacked three hits, including a triple, scored three runs and had two RBI.&nbsp;Desiree Nickerson&nbsp;also hit a triple and scored four runs out of the leadoff spot.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corinne Sutula notched two hits, including a double, scored three runs and drove in two. Leah Webber also recorded two hits and two RBI, while Gabby Fernandez, Lyla Weigel and Leah Webber all finished with two hits apiece.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brianna Morin capped the title with a home run in the second inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pure domination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They did a very good job of being respectful while still&nbsp;playing the game correctly,” Whitlock said.&nbsp;“Not letting&nbsp;up but&nbsp;playing respectfully so not to show up anyone. I’m very proud of the individual efforts but also proud of their sportsmanship and how they treated the other team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bella Luciani, Alicea Ramirez, Haylee Harrison, Kayla Czaplicki, Kayla Webber and Sierra Albert all contributed to this title, as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You can’t take it for granted” Adam Whitlock said.&nbsp;“This is my daughter’s last season playing little league or junior league or senior league. This is it.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;I am enjoying&nbsp;every last&nbsp;moment of her happiness, her success and to see&nbsp;her&nbsp;surrounded by the kids that she chooses to spend her time with is especially rewarding. It’s a great group of young ladies. Some of them have many more years to play, some of them this is their very last year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol moves on to the Eastern Regionals, an event the team is very familiar with.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think they are excited and know what to expect,” said Whitlock, who coaches alongside Eric Beebe and Steve Albert.&nbsp;“(Many of them) have been here before and know what kind of challenge&nbsp;this is. I give them a lot of credit for preparing themselves accordingly. They are going to take last&nbsp;years’ experience&nbsp;and grow from it.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This championship capped an amazing two weeks for the Bristol softball community. The Bristol 14U squad captured both the district and sectional titles in its age group, while the Bristol 10U team won the district title Wednesday and is off to sectionals next week.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Adam Whitlock,&nbsp;who is the President of BGLLS, this week has brought an immense amount of pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s pretty incredible to see the youngest ones to the oldest ones and those in&nbsp;between have so much success in a game where they’ve put a lot of work in,” Whitlock said.&nbsp;“It’s not by mistake, it’s not by coincidence, it is the younger sisters of the older sisters. It’s the cousins, it’s the ones who have modeled themselves after their moms who played very successfully. This community grows ballplayers because there is a lot of attention and focus on the fall and the winter and the spring. These kids just come out and ball. I’m&nbsp;really happy&nbsp;for all of them.”</p>
