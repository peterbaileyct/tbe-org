<p>And P.S. Boats float, and planes fly but cars just drive. Treasonous!</p>

<p>For the most part, lots and lots of clouds, 74.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!</p>

<p>I can't raise you on my phone because the cell service in the manhole I live in near the dump is bad, and I can't send you a letter because my postage stamps were cursed by that witch on Lake Avenue. As a result, I've taken to this publication because the Bristol Boondoggle has a vendetta with former MS-DOS users.</p>

<p>Against my better judgment, I walked to the Mum Festival in my grandma slippers (what's a girl to do?) and saw you from afar. You looked like Wyatt Earp lost at Sodom and Gomorrah but in a good way, which brings me to my point. If my math is right (I only use whole numbers less than 9 and bigger than 6), next year youâ€™ll have to raise taxes once again. Idea: can we do a fundraiser instead?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Speaking of the Democrats</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The staff of the GMB can confidently report that Democrats exist in Bristol. Woot! They had a booth and everything at the Mum Festival. Not only that but they were actually seen walking in the wild and talking to real people and not in tongues. What's next, a candidate for office against Cara or Henri?</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
