<p>BERLIN - The Bristol Eastern baseball squad opened a 3-1edge just two-and-a-half innings into its game against Berlin on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But an eight run third did-in the Lancers as the Redcoats secured a 10-4 victory in a CCC South showdown from Sage Park in Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads are now 1-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had only five hits for the game, including two by Jose Feliciano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He generated a run scoring single in the first frame and added a triple in the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers notched two runs in the top of the first as Ryan Maglio singled past shortstop with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rio Fernandez was later hit by a pitch and Feliciano singled to center, scoring Ben D’Amato who reached on a fielder’s choice to make it 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky's infield single quickly loaded the bases and when Owen Myers was hit by a pitch, Fernandez came home for the second run of the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin got a run back in the second stanza when Aiden Cooney tripled to right center and scored when the ball was misplayed in the outfield, trimming the deficit to 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the third, Fernandez led off with a walk, stole second, went to third on a groundout and scored on a wild pitch - making it a 3-1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the bottom of the tilt, twelve Berlin batters marched to the plate which led to four walks and one hit batsmen - all eventually coming home to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats also scored on a passed ball and a wild pitch while managing four hits during that stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern starter Mike Roalf loaded the bases with no outs, following a leadoff single by Luke Wadstrup and two walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf got an out on a force play at the plate off a grounder to third but a walk to&nbsp;Max Weber forced in a run as Berlin cut the deficit to one at 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single to center by Will Gomes drove in the tying run but a comebacker and force play at the dish led to a second out as Eastern nearly got out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a passed ball saw Berlin score again, making it 4-3, and the Lancers were never able to draw even again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wild pitch netted another run for the Redcoats and on a single by Cooney and another base-on-balls, the bases were juiced once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Jonny Montgomery then came in to relieve Roalf but Berlin had one last hit left to generate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first batter Montgomery faced, Gavin Carubba, tripled to right center which cleared the bases and propelled Berlin to a 9-3 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fourth, Eastern’s Gabe White walked, stole second, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Connor Cyr's sac fly that made it 9-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin scored one final run in the bottom of the fourth as John O'Brien doubled to left with no outs, went to third on a wild pitch, and scored on a groundout to push the lead out to 10-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery pitched well, going 2.1 innings in relief of Roalf, giving up only two hits and single run.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky pitched a scoreless sixth in relief of Montgomery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin's Justin Eckrote threw four solid innings in relief of Nate Snyder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just two singles, one run,&nbsp;struck out four, and walked only one to pick up the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>All time, Berlin is 16-7 in 23 career games against Bristol Eastern… The Kingstreeters play their 1241st all-time game on Monday afternoon when the Lancers travel to Rocky Hill for a CCC Interdivisional tilt at 3:45 p.m.</p>
