<p>With soulful brown eyes, a calm demeanor and the training to comfort those experiencing trauma, Okee the fire dog is on duty. In just 10 short days, the 3-year-old emotional support dog has made a positive impact on Bristol residents.</p>

<p>“We took her to the parks and rec camp at Bristol Eastern last week, and she met about 150 kids,” said Bristol Fire Chief Richard Hart. “She has a better social life than most people, she’s in high demand.”</p>

<p>Okee was rescued and trained to be an emotional support dog by K9s For Warriors in Ponte Vedra Florida. The 3-year-old Shepard-Hound mix is the first fire peer support dog in the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okee arrived in Connecticut on Aug. 5.</p>

<p>Hart said Okee’s primary mission is peer support. She will join the eight firefighters on the peer support team, who help their fellow first responders to manage common behavior issues that may be affecting them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okee will also provide emotional support to Bristol residents who are experiencing traumatic events. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Okee will be available to provide emotional support after a traumatic incident. She’ll walk around the room from person to person, and her job is to make friends” said Hart. “She’s a great addition to the city, and she’s just a sweetheart.”</p>

<p>In addition to providing emotional support, Okee will play an important role in educating children on fire safety. The caring canine will visit Bristol elementary school this October to teach the kids how to stop, drop and roll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
