<p>MIDDLETOWN - The beat continues for the Bristol American Legion 17U baseball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Tuesday evening, Post 2 continued its winning ways with its 5-0 shutout of Middletown from Pat Kidney Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol moved to a Zone 3 leading 8-1 overall while the program from Middletown dropped to 4-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second shutout in a row for the team from Bristol, outscoring Torrington and Middletown over the last two games by an 8-0 push while allowing just a handful of hits during that stretch (four overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 nabbed 12 hits in the contest to stave off the home team while Middletown had more errors (three) than hits (two) that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol nabbed three runs in the third inning and added another two in the fourth to snare that 5-0 edge, never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jonathan Montgomery pitched Bristol to the win, earning the shutout behind a sterling 97 pitch performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The complete game gem by Montgomery complemented a tremendous hitting attack by the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White lead the attack from the plate, going 3-for-4 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two-way player Caleb Molinsky, Mason Harris and Montgomery all tallied two hits apiece for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Colvin, Caleb (how often does a baseball team have&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;</em>players with the first name of Caleb on their squad?) Simard, Drew Martineau, Brian Grabowski and Brayden Schenck all roped up hits for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory is the second in a row for the locals who won’t see action again until Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>All alone in first place</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top five teams in Zone 3 are separated by just two games, led by the outfit from Bristol (8-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is a perfect 5-0 at home and 3-1 on the road to compile that winning tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol team has yet to lose a game in regulation this year as the 9-8 setback to Tri-Country came over eighth inning play in what turned into a suspended affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington (6-1) is a game behind Post 2 while Waterford (6-2) sits in third place in the Zone 3 standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the mix is Ellington and Tri-County, both sitting at 5-2 and two games out of first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>They can be only one…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of records in the state, no one has a better ledger than Bristol in 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck leads Zone 2 at 7-1 while Danbury (5-1) just lost on Tuesday as Post 2 is in the driver’s seat statewide.</p>
