<p>Here we go. Another week begins.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does anyone know the answer to Friday's trivia question. We gotcha! There was no trivia question on Friday! You really need to pay closer attention.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weather for Monday</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sunny, with a few afternoon clouds. High of 74. Winds from the NE at 5 to 10 mph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enjoy a beautiful day!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On this day in history</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1906, the Wright brothers' flying machine is patented. The American aviation pioneers are credited with having performed “the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.” (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1980, the arcade game Pac-Man is released.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(The editors of TBE will leave up to you, the reader, as to which of these two events is more important. But, because we are afraid of flying, we go with Pac-Man).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Central vs. Eastern</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight, at 6 p.m., Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern play at Muzzy Field. It will be Senior Night for both teams. As the great Yankee catcher, Yogi Berra said, "Baseball is 90 percent mental. The other half is physical." That will definitely be true at Muzzy Field tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whoever loses tonight, remember the immortal words of Tom Hanks (Jimmy Dugan), "There's no crying in baseball!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Moon phase</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our final item is that tonight the moon will be beginning its waning crescent phase. Surgical operations are recommended during the Waning Moon. However, avoid surgeries of organs under the influence of the Moon Sign, specifically, the feet, toes, and the pineal gland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You're welcome, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
