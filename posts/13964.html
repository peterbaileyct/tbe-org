<p>HOLYOKE – After racing out to a 3-0 lead, the Bristol Blues were in a prime position to score its second victory of the season against the Valley Blue Sox on Wednesday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Sox scored three runs in both the fifth and sixth innings to stave off defeat as the Blues fell by a 6-3 final in a New England Collegiate Baseball League showdown from McKenzie Stadium in Holyoke, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Valley’s first win (1-1) while Bristol (1-1) fell for the first time in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues pitching staff of William Paoli, Corey Savedoff (loss, five walks, four Ks), John Farley (two strikeouts), Joseph Rios, and former Bristol Eastern standout Jagger Duquette (three Ks, one hit) allowed a combined three hits but gave up eight walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valley’s Brian Strange (five Ks) earned the win while Jordan Yoder (one walk, four Ks) took home the save for the program from Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither squad had a hit for extra bases last night but Valley’s Anthony Sherwin led the charge with a single, a base-on-balls, and three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s A.J. Gaich (2-for-3, two walks, two RBI) and Griffin Arnone (2-for-3, two runs) led the charge offensively for the locals? The Sox tallied 15 total strikeouts and allowed just three walks as Bristol’s offense dried up midway through the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues posted a run in the third and two more in the fourth to square up a 3-0 cushion through three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Sox closed out the showdown with six straight runs to snare the game away from Bristol – leading their first loss of the NECBL campaign.</p>

<p>Currently, Gaich is leading the Blues in batting average at .500 – going 2-of-4 overall with a team-leading six base-on-balls along with two RBI and a stolen base from the leadoff position in the batting order for the Blues.</p>
