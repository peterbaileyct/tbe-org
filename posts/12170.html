<h4>150 Years Ago – March 1872</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday evening there were rowdy times in the saloon neighborhood. Albro Castle, John Atkins, Eugene Lane, Wallace Allen and Sam Barnes, Jr. were in the village and had imbibed as freely as imbibers are apt to do….Two of them went to Duncan’s and called for liquor but were refused and ordered out the door. Allen punched the clerk and got knocked down for his pain. Allen was unable to get up the mountain as far as his house. One of the parties who accompanied him left him by the side of the road, considerately building a fire to keep him from freezing. The next morning he was found in the same spot, sufficiently sobered to tend to the fire but with both feet badly frosted.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse near the ME Church caught fire about 5 o’clock Tuesday afternoon. It commenced under the floor near the teacher’s desk at some distance from the stove. It is suspected that rats had accumulated some combustibles there but how they contrived to set fire to them remains a mystery. The fire was discovered by some parties who drove under the church shed to hitch their horse and was quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>The freshet on Sunday came near to carrying away the dam on Ingraham’s lower fish pond. The frost had lifted the plank raceway so when the water rose rapidly it worked its way under it and threatened to carry away the embankment. By strenuous exertion the dam was saved and no fish were lost.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a smart frost in this vicinity Monday night, the thermometer standing at 7 degrees below zero. Such weather is very unfavorable for early gardening. Persons who expect to plant potatoes or corn this week will probably need a pickaxe or a set of blasting tools. We would advise anyone to lay down the shovel and the hoe for a few days.</p>
