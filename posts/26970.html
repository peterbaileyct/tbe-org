<p>BRISTOL - When the Bristol Central softball team made its 2023 Class L postseason debut on Wednesday afternoon, the second ranked program continued to prove why it’s one of the top squads in all the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in second round play, it was a little first inning hitting and a whole lot of Central pitching sensation Sophia Torreso that shut down No. 15 Pomperaug - allowing the Rams to scoop up a 3-0 victory, moving to the quarterfinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso and Central (22-2) simply did not relent against a very good Pomperaug team despite just generating five hits and scoring its runs over just one inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Survive and advance,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “It wasn’t the prettiest game that we’ve played. [But] we need that. We need to know we can play though errors and we can play through a lack of offensive execution. We missed some signs today. We did some things we don’t traditionally do and the fact that we were still able to come out on top shows that these kids just grind it out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m proud of them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Too much Torreso (14 strikeouts) meant opportunities were few and far at the dish for the Panthers (13-9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on how the game was scored, Pomperaug was limited to just one hit - a blooper to right field that Central’s Lillian VanNostrand made one heck of an effort to track down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than that, it was all Central from start to finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It felt good,” said Torreso of the win. “My arm, it’s been a little tired, a little rough but I think just focusing on hitting my spots and that my team can play defense as well are the most important things right now, especially going into tournament time. I just have to trust they’re going to be behind me.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the showdown, Torreso collected her 500th strikeout, a tremendous accomplishment by the two-time All-Stater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central put together a slick two out rally in the bottom of the first frame, zipping up three runs to put the game away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso drew a walk and Lorelei Stancavage - catching her 800th strikeout during game play - followed up with a single to center, putting two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso scooted home via an RBI single to center by VanNostrand as Central grabbed a 1-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Mya Porrini followed with a huge base hit to center, clearing the bases, as the Rams led 3-0 through one completed frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we pull away from teams [by] a couple runs, it gives the pitcher some kind of comfort,” said Torreso. “And I’m able to work on a pitch that’s maybe not working in the first inning or isn’t moving the way I want it to. But when we have a three-run lead on a team like this, I think that it just gives me an opportunity to work on those things and to be able to put the ball into the zone so that the team can make plays behind me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There wasn’t much brewing for Pomperaug early offensively as Torreso posted three Ks against her first six batters, keeping runners off the bases and kept that 3-0 cushion intact going into the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the third, two more strikeouts from Torreso kept the Rams perfect in the field and back up to the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the frame, Central had three batters reach base without the benefit of a hit as Torreso walked, Stancavage reached on a fielder’s choice and Porrini drew a base on balls to load things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adrianna Lubrico grounded out to end the third, but the pressure was on Pomperaug, trailing 3-0, with Torreso dealing and dishing rockets to the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers finally got a runner on base in the fourth inning as Ava Hare drew a one-out walk and quickly stole second and third to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Torreso won a long battle against Alex Bisceglia, eventually earning her seventh K, ending the inning with Pomperaug still waiting for its first run - and hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s living in the moment right now,” said Hayes of Torreso. “She’s absolutely thriving and taking this team under her wings, saying, ‘Come on, let’s go.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s fun to watch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pomperaug went to Morgan Burrus in the circle to start the fourth and with one gone, Central’s Dez Nickerson cracked a single past the second baseman to start another drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She swiped second base with two outs but did not advance as Pomperaug was down three runs heading into the fifth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers were simply having a hard time keeping up with Central’s senior in the circle as Torreso zipped up two strikeouts before walking Catherine Parrott - only her second free pass of the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso eventually fanned the side to get Central to the bottom of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanNostrand ditched a single past second base for Central’s fifth hit of the showdown, and it appeared Porrini had dropped a gapper into left but a spectacular catch by Pomperaug freshmen Corinne Sartor ended the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kaley Laird made a slick catch behind second base to open the sixth stanza, but Hare made it on when her comeback to Torreso wasn’t fielded cleanly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was of little consequence because Torreso struck out Burrus for her eleventh K as Pomperaug went back into the field still hitless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lubrico reached base to start the bottom of the stanza on an error but never made it to second as the Panthers had to score three times in the top of the seventh to draw even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alexandra Bisceglia started the rally by reaching first base on an error while Santor dropped a Texas leaguer into right - putting two on without the benefit of an out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the event, Torreso fanned Julia Carter, Parrott and Alexis Mackenzie as Central pulled out a 3-0 triumph over Pomperaug to advance to quarterfinal round play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hit a rough patch at the end, but we came together, and I think we ended it in a good way,” said Torreso.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Central returns to action today at 2:30 p.m., squaring off against No. 7 St. Joseph. The Cadets were easy 16-1 winners over No. 10 Woodstock in second round action…Against Pomperaug, Mya Porrini was first to the bathroom for Central during game play, breaking Kaley Laird’s streak of 15 game consecutive games of getting to the latrine first. Lots of money was lost in Las Vegas that day.</p>
