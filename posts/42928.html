<p>Retired Bristol Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis “Fran” Murphy is a St. Patrick’s Day buff, as most who know him will attest. Fran and his wife, Maryann, sent me a St. Patrick’s Day card, and the envelope it was in included a shamrock and plastic golden coin. Fran is known for this, and I’ve received this package many times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Murphy Family and I go back. Brother Tom was in my high school class, and a friend. Fran was a few years older than us, and played varsity basketball for Bristol High, guys who I looked up to growing up in late grammar school. Maryann is Fran’s faithful partner, and they do everything together.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve known Tom’s wife, Carmen, since I was a young man working at “The AEtna” in Hartford. She’s a sweetheart, too. Not to end it there, I took pleasure in visiting Fran and Tom’s late parents on a few occasions, Francis “Hop” and Nellie Murphy. “Hop” was a standout pitcher at Bristol High in days gone by with the ball seemingly hopping around during a throw.</p>

<p><strong>This and that</strong></p>

<p>I received a phone call from Bob Barnett this week, and enjoyed a great conversation with this man, to me a legendary military and community-minded individual; I parked my car in the lower lot at Prospect United Methodist Church on Tuesday afternoon and eye-balled the first 100 vehicles that passed by. Of them, eight were pick-up trucks; Shout out to Ron Piasecki, who should be returning here soon for a summer visit from Florida. </p>

<p>Shout out to retired Bristol Fire Department driver Mark Redman; A belated Happy Birthday to Johnny Burnham, a popular former sports writer for The Bristol Press, and now affiliated with both Bristol Hospital and Greater Central Connecticut Chambers of Commerce; Christine Road is named after the builder’s daughter. The builder was Sigmund “Sig” Neumann 1924-2016. Christine was listed as Christine Neumann living in Barre, Vt., a few years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Richard 'Bob' Caron</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Richard, a real estate/insurance man who most called Bob, died on March 14. He was a standout athlete as a member of the Class of ‘48 at Bristol High. He later played in college and in adult leagues here and out of town. Afterwards, he mentored various youth sports in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recognized for his sports endeavors, he was honored by the Bristol Midget Football League in 1981 and the Bristol Tramps with the Harp Broderick Award in 1984, while inducted into the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. A family man with three daughters and grandchildren, Bob always looked much younger than he was. He was in his early 90’s.</p>

<p><strong>Hank Lodge - BSHOF</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I visited with Hank Lodge on Wednesday afternoon and the subject we discussed was the “Scrapbook” section of the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame website: <a href="http://bshof.org">bshof.org</a>. Hank has worked on this diligently in recent years and its photos and wording on different aspects of Bristol sports, teams, individuals, etc. A fun walk down memory lane going back as far as the early 1900’s.</p>

<p>One fellow I hope to put together a "bio" for as far as someone to consider for induction is Steve Allaire’s father, the late Ben Alliare, one of a standout set of brothers who took part in earlier local athletics. I spoke with Steve on this some years ago, but we never completed this mission.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Brown</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently mentioned the name of former Bristol Press Editor Bill Sarno, and the other night after going to bed the name of Bob Brown surfaced. Bob was the editor prior to Bill, and he was a great guy, also. I haven’t seen Bob in a couple of years now, so I say “Hello” and wish him the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
