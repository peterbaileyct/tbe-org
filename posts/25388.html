<p>Logan Rembish and Dom Napoletano combined to toss a one hitter as St. Paul defeated Derby 11-1 Tuesday afternoon in Bristol. Rembish pitched the first four innings, allowing just one unearned run on one hit while striking out nine to pick up his 3rd win on the season. </p>

<p>Ryan Slack picked up Derby's sole hit, a ground ball single through the infield with one out in the top of the 1st inning. A walk to Mack Neto moved Slack to 2nd, and a successful double steal put men on 2nd and 3rd with just one out. A passed ball allowed Slack to score, and Derby led 1-0.</p>

<p>For the Falcons in the bottom of the 1st, Jamie Leggett doubled with one out and came in to score on Cal Chance's RBI single. That tied the score at 1-1.</p>

<p>After Derby failed to score in the top of the 2nd, Ryan Kilpatrick singled to lead off the bottom of the frame for St Paul. Kilpatrick advanced to 2nd on a ground out, 3rd on a wild pitch, and scored on AJ Corrado's RBI single. Corrado stole 2nd, advanced to 3rd on a wild pitch, and scored on Logan Rembish's SAC fly to center. St Paul led 3-1 after two innings.</p>

<p>After failing to score in the 3rd inning, the Falcons blew the game open in the 4th. Corrado led off and was hit by the first pitch. Arden Polverari walked, and was replaced by pinch runner Tony DeSena. Rembish then bunted for a base hit, and the ball was thrown away allowing Corrado and DeSena to score. Devin Kulas was hit by a pitch to put 2 on. From here St Paul had 4 consecutive RBI hits by Chance (single, RBI), Cole Raymond (single, RBI), Kilpatrick (double, RBI), and Jonathan Remillard (single, two RBIs) to make it 10-1.</p>
