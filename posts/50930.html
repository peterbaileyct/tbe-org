<p><br>Avon (3-1-1) used a Rayhan Shameen goal to defeat Bristol Eastern (1-2-1), 1-0, in a   Friday evening contest at Bristol Eastern.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"It was a close contest, with us carrying the early momentum and Avon getting energy and a goal late in the first half," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; &nbsp;"We had many free kicks and corners, but couldn't capitalize on them."</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With twelve minutes left in the first half, Avon's Diego Garza sent a ball into the Eastern penalty area that resulted in a collision between Shameen and Lancer goalie, Connor Murtaugh.&nbsp; The ball fell loose to the ground and Shameen was able to knock it into the net for the game's only score.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Both sides had chances to score in the second half, but each side's defense was able to thwart the opponent's attack.&nbsp; Murtaugh ended with 7 saves while Avon's Jordan Beaudoin made 10 saves.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
