<p>MIDDLETOWN -- There’s a new Connecticut Senior American Legion baseball champion this year as Danbury was able to topple an offensive minded Waterford program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danbury earned a 2-0 sweep to move onto the Northeast Regional in Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The championship round, held from Palmer Field in Middletown on Friday and Saturday, saw Waterford score a total of 10 runs over two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Post 161 was no match for Danbury in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday night, Danbury won the first game in the best of three series -- grabbing a 8-5 victory to move ahead 1-0 in the tourney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford led 4-1 through one frame but was outscored 7-1 the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danbury’s Casey Katz (3.2 IP) earned the victory in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in an immediate rematch on Saturday, Danbury closed out postseason play with a 9-5 victory over Waterford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning pitcher Jack Gunzy went the distance to snare the title, throwing 97 pitches and allowing just seven hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was a 4-4 game through four innings as the squads battled tooth-and-nail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danbury then scored five straight runs to ice the game and the CT Senior American Legion Championship.</p>
