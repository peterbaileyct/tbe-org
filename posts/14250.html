<p class="has-medium-font-size">Theresa was born in Bristol, Feb. 15, 1931, the daughter of the late Alfred (Fred) and Jennie Napolitano. She remained a lifelong Bristol resident, attending all the local schools. Terry, as she was known by all her loved ones, led a life of compassion beginning at 16 by spending three years as a Nurse’s Aide at Bristol Hospital while attending Bristol High School. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">After graduation, she attended Burbank Nursing School, in Fitchburg, Mass., completing a three-year RN degree in Nursing Science. After graduating, she returned to Bristol and was employed by the Bristol Hospital until she returned to school to further her degree. The first of two Master’s Degrees from CCSU was in teaching and brought her to train others at New Britain Hospital and then Tunxis Community College. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">She went on to receive a second Master’s Degree in Marriage and Family Counseling and completed a thousand supervised hours that qualified her to take the examination to become a licensed therapist. Terry was the first CCSU Graduate to qualify for, and successfully pass the rigorous state certification test, an enormous accomplishment since it goes far beyond the Master’s level. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a graduate student, Terry received the University’s Graduate Studies Scholarship and an Honors Award from the Dept. of Psychology in recognition of outstanding research and commitment. Terry was recently presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award through her senior living residence, Farmington Station. Terry was successful in her career, as well as the beautiful family that she and Ed created. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to her husband, she is survived by her two brothers, Alfred Napolitano of Florida; John Napolitano of Bristol; her five children, Edgar (Jay) Hamel of Plano, Texas; Susan Thiem and husband Michael of Bristol; Laureen Roberts and husband Ronald of Hilton Head, S.C.; Donald Hamel and wife Maria of Norwich, Conn.; Robert Hamel and wife Joann of Plainville, Conn.; 10 grandchildren, seven great grandchildren; several nephews; a niece; cousins; and dear friends.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Terry never stopped wanting to learn. She had an on-going interest in various continuing education programs, and always made time for seminars to grow herself. She loved reading, music, gardening, and needlework. She raised, and loved so many Labradors through her life, and especially missed her last girl Lindy. Her family was her heart, and soul, and she always made time to help anyone in need.</p>
