<p>New Cambridge Project Collective's owner James Ferro has brought his brewery to Bristol to fill a gap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People in Bristol tend to stay in Bristol when it comes to shopping, entertainment,” Ferro said in a recent interview. “So, it was something that the town needed and the town wanted.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferro said he met his current partners at Twelve Percent Beer Project in North Haven. Coincidently, it was around the same time Ferro's father decided to open the brewery in Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was about June last year that my father was like, ‘Let’s open up a brewery here in Bristol,” he said. “Both Firefly and Better Half had folded.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferro worked with his father in restaurant development and said, “Beer used to be my fun job,” until he decided to go in full-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While his family is supportive of NCP and often show up as customers, Ferro said it was important for him to step out on his own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His partners are Dan Parisi, Lou Vega, Spencer Schankle and Victoria Pena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m the one here up in front in the tasting room running events, music [and] day-to-day activities,” Ferro said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said Vega is the head brewer, Schankle is the middleman and Parisi does distribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his new routine, Ferro said he arrives at NCP in between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and cleans, makes social media posts, answers emails, pays the bills and open the brewery at 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferro said NCP offers seasonal drinks like Marzins and distributes Firefly Hollow, NCP, Boondoggle, Shakespeare and Skeleton Key.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re already in distribution statewide for both the Firefly Hollow and for The New Cambridge Project brands,” Ferro said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The New Cambridge Project is located at 139 Center St. Its hours are Tuesday, 3 to 8 p.m.; Wednesday, 3 to 9 p.m.; Thursday and Friday, 3 to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 12 noon to 10 p.m.; and Sunday, 12 noon to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
