<h3>Loudest noise</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several GMB staff members are fond of noise, and they discovered that according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the loudest noise ever recorded occurred on Aug. 27, 1883, when the island volcano Krakatoa, in the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java, Indonesia,&nbsp;exploded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The noise was heard 3,100 miles away, and it is estimated that it covered 8 percent of the Earth’s surface.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
