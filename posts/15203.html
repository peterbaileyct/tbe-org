<p>Baseball slid into the Bristol Public library children’s department when members of the Bristol Blues stopped by on Thursday. Young fans were treated to a grand slam of stories before having an opportunity to meet the players.</p>

<p>First baseman Cal Parrillo started the morning off by reading “Randy Riley’s Really Big Hit,” right-handed pitcher M.T. Morrissey delighted fans with “Quacky Baseball,” and lefty John Farley recited “Baseball Ballerina.” Catcher Craig Corliss joined his teammates to sign autographs and answer baseball questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Center fielder Calvin McCall was surprised to find that Maryann Kovalski’s picture book “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” required his musical talents. When one of the characters in the book spontaneously began to sing the song of the same name, the University of Rhode Island senior followed suit.</p>

<p>“I had a blast, and this was just so much fun for me. I didn’t know I would be singing but I’m glad that I did. I really like Bristol and I hope that I can come back next summer.”</p>

<p>Blues intern Julia Simpson said that the players have had an active week in the Bristol community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yesterday we went to the Boys &amp; Girls Club, and everyone had fun. Today we’re here at the library and then we have a game against Mystic tonight.”</p>

<p>The Blues played their first home game of the week on Wednesday, where fans celebrated “Christmas in July.” As holiday classics like “Carol of the Bells” blasted through the 93-degree heat, Kris Kringle made the journey to Muzzy Field. Santa showcased his athletic side by throwing out the first pitch and running with excited children in the Stampede. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Blues have seven games remaining in their 44-game regular season, and the western division champs will enter the postseason in August. &nbsp;</p>
