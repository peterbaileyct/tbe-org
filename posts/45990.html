<p>An interim principal was appointed Tuesday to lead Ivy Drive School in the wake of the announcement that an investigation is being conducted at the school by the state for alleged testing irregularities under the former administration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sara Kulig, a K-5 Math Coach and Director of the Step Up Summer School Program, has been named to replace the former principal, effective Friday, May 24. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parents of Bristol Public School students and BPS staff were informed of the choice via an email sent through the ParentSquare communications system late on the afternoon of May 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, May 20, a day before, parents and staff were informed through the same system of alleged testing irregularities at the school and that BPS would be naming an interim shortly. The email states that the former principal was placed on administrative leave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcements followed the naming of an Acting Superintendent of Schools, Iris White, the earlier in the month after the previous Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Catherine Carbone, announced rather abruptly that she would be retiring. Carbone's last day was May 15. White began the next day.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kulig earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education and a master's degree in curriculum and instruction from the University of Connecticut," the email, signed by the acting superintendent, states, "as well as a certificate of advanced graduate studies in advanced educational leadership from the University of New England."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kulig has been a K-5 Math Coach since 2019, the email states, working with several schools in the district, including Ivy Drive. She has planned and implemented curriculum, developed building schedules and provided in-class support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kulig, the email continues, serves as the director of the Step Up Summer School Program, and previously was a first and fourth grade teacher at Greene-Hills School, a kindergarten teacher at Ellen P. Hubbell School, kindergarten and second grade teacher at O'Connell School and a special education pre-kindergarten and kindergarten teacher at Plymouth Summer School in Plymouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Mrs. Kulig brings nearly 15 years of elementary teaching experience to her new role as Interim Principal of Ivy Drive," the email states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Details of the investigation have not been released, but the BPS administration states in the email to fully cooperate with the state Department of Education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In order to preserve the integrity of the investigation and maintain student confidentiality, we cannot provide further information at this time. &nbsp;Please rest assured that the education and well-being of our students remains the districtâ€™s top priority," the email concludes.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
