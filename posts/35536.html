<p>The Bristol Eastern girls cross country team came away a huge winner at the annual City Series meet from Rockwell Park on a brilliant Thursday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only did the Lancers finally topple the program from Bristol Central, but a familiar face also took home the individual championship once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern sophomore sensation Kaelyn Gonzalez won the race for the second year in a row as the Kingstreeters downed the Rams, 27-29, to seize a tremendous victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels really good” to beat Central said Gonzalez. “We’ve been waiting for this for a long time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers also picked off St. Paul Catholic (23-36).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To complete the day, the Rams were able to top the pesky Falcons, 23-32.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Last year, really didn’t have enough [girls] to score at many meets and we had a ton girls come out” this year said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “And the culture that they have, how supportive they are of each other, it’s so great to see.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez, a winner last season on the course from St. Paul Catholic, followed it up with a stellar time of 22:51.5 to take first place once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It felt really good,” said Gonzalez of the back-to-back wins. “I’m so proud of myself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This bout was an epic challenge with Central, doing a bit of pack running, had three of the first five runners in the race cross the finish line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Gonzalez, St. Paul Catholic’s Gretchen Radcliff (23:33) took second place off a very nice showing before third place was a bit of a surprise.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central freshmen Emersyn Mazzei (23:58.7) was an impressive third place finisher while the wheelhouse for the squad - seniors Sophia Stark (24:13) and Katie Tran (24:21.5) - took fourth and fifth place, respectively, as the program was in good shape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But four of the next five runners to complete the course came from Eastern to seal the meet as Central had a little bad luck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We felt going in, we looked pretty good, but I had one girl out hurt [Lynae Lewis] who would have been in my [top] four or five,” said Central coach Stafford-Kirk. “One of girls, Ruth Smith, was running really well and something happened in the woods.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was close, it was a competitive race and that’s what we like to see.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul Catholic’s Maddie Bielecki (sixth, 24:42.5) ran extremely well to keep the program from the Naugatuck Valley League hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was all Eastern from there as the grouping of Kaydence Meyer (seventh, 25:34.9), veteran Lauren Ayotte (eighth, 25:40), Rita Gao (ninth, 26:19.7) and Calliope Gallagher (10th, 26:26) clinched it for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They really raced for each other today and I think it showed on the course,” said Ryskowski. “I’ve very proud of them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding out the top-15 were Central’s Emma Cavallari (11th, 26:54), Eastern’s Grace Steck (12th, 27:05) and St. Paul Catholic’s Alexia Akier (13th, 27:27) along with the Rams’ Johannie Juarez (14th, 27:41) and the Falcons’ Charlotte Jennings (15th, 28:10.8).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez took the lead early to begin the race and never relented, having about a 50-yard advantage over Radcliff when the duo crossed the bridge to enter the park for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was pack running with its freshmen standout and senior duo in tow while Bielecki was in eye-shot of the trio from BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Meyer/Ayotte/Gao crew wasn’t far behind as the tone of the race was set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The formation kept pace when re-entering the park from the far bridge and into the hillier terrain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the second time by the park bridge entrance, Gonzalez had pulled away and it became just a matter of when she crossed the finish line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez ended the event in 22:51.5 while Radcliff, who also gave it her all, was a little over forty seconds behind to earn the runner-up medal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the race was all over when Eastern’s four-pack of athletes took positions 7-10 as the Lancers were narrow two-point victors over their crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I hate losing but I like to see competition,” said Stafford-Kirk. “I’d much rather have a race like today where we’re pushed by Bristol Eastern and St. Paul then a race where we blew everybody away. I think it says a lot about cross country in town that the races were so competitive. I’m really happy about that”</p>
