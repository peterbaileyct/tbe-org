<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ran a women’s clinic in West Hartford in the 1980’s. At one point, about 20 percent of our clients were from Bristol. Some of you remember those days. You would come in afraid that you were pregnant or perhaps suspecting a sexually transmitted disease or maybe you just needed an annual exam.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We kept your secrets. You might meet me or another staff member on the streets of Bristol and we would not say hello or in any way divulge that we knew you. Some of you told us that you couldn’t tell your parents or perhaps, your parents were with you. Some of you came to us referred by your own doctor who didn’t perform abortions and that’s what you wanted. Some Bristol doctors referred a lot of patients to us. In some cases, trusted friends or family members were with you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You passed picketers on the way in. You may have been in the clinic on one of the days when we had to evacuate because of a bomb threat and then go back in to continue providing services.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1985, the citizens of Bristol voted on a non-binding referendum as to whether the Supreme Court’s decision on abortion should be overturned. Though not expected, Bristol’s voters supported reproductive choice and voted 56 to 44 percent to say that Roe v. Wade should stay in place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s 2022 and the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;Politicians across this country have passed laws restricting access to abortion and on other reproductive choices.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut currently has legal protections in place, but they can be replaced with restrictions by legislators with an anti-choice agenda. Currently, Rep. Cara Pavalock-Damato and Sen. Henri Martin are both opposed to and have voted against bills to protect women’s reproductive rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have alternatives this fall. On Nov. 8, I hope that if you or someone you love has had to be in the position to consider an abortion, has needed ready access to the morning after pill, IUD’s or other forms of birth control, that you vote. When you vote, please vote for people who will support a full range of choices for women. Mary Fortier, Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller and Greg Hahn all will do that. Vote Democratic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
