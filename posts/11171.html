<p>Following the excitement generated at Wednesday's Board of Education (BOE) meeting, which resulted in the BOE authoring a resolution requesting that policymaking be returned to the local boards of education, and the recent revelation that the Wheeler clinic is back in play at Center Square, all eyes will be on the City Council meeting tonight.</p>

<p>In December, while marinating in the goodwill extended to them by the public following the election, the newly elected city council stunned everyone by poo-pooing the Wheeler project in a 5-2 vote because it was, in essence, not sexy due to its non-profit status.</p>

<p>The Wheeler Five said their constituents want entertainment and shops, not non-profits.</p>

<p>Tonight, the city council has another crack at it because the Bristol Economic and Community Development Committee received revised plans for the project. Consequently, the issue is on the menu again, which will require two of the Wheeler Five to switch their votes.</p>
