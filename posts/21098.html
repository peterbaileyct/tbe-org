<p>“This highest form of recognition in governmental accounting and financial reporting represents a significant accomplishment by the City of Bristol. We hope that your example will encourage other government officials in their efforts to achieve and maintain an appropriate standard of excellence in financial reporting,” stated GFOA Director, Technical Services, Michele Mark Levine.  </p>

<p>The report was judged by an impartial panel to meet the high standards of the GFOA program, which includes demonstrating a constructive “spirit of full disclosure” to clearly communicate its financial story and motivate potential users and user groups to read the report.</p>

<p>“Financial reporting for governments has become extremely complex over the last few years with ever changing standards and reporting requirements for accountability and transparency,” stated Comptroller Diane Waldron. “Robin Manuele, Assistant Comptroller, and staff should be commended for their work to ensure Bristol meets these requirements and GFOA criteria in helping to achieve this accomplishment.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Mayor Jeff Caggiano said, “I am extremely proud of the work that our Board of Finance, and Department Heads do in collaboration with the Comptroller’s Office that enabled us to gain this recognition. Bristol has and will continue to be a fiscal leader in terms of good financial practices and ultimately that is a huge win for taxpayers.”</p>
