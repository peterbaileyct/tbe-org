<p>September's monthly meeting of the Code Enforcement Committee saw a lengthy list of properties in need of follow ups and others which will require further inspection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the way of new business, the committee started out with a property that was brought to their attention as 306 Terryville St. The complaint was left anonymously about a deck code violation. However, there is no 306 on Terryville Street, but there is a 306 on Terryville Avenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, this was pointed out to be a two-family home so the committee mentioned that it is very possible that this property in question could be 304 Terryville St. The committee decided further research needs to be completed on this complaint due to the inconclusive nature of the current information.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another property brought up for discussion was 210 Divinity St. Up to this point, this property was listed as a five-family unit, but speculation began to form that it may be hosting six families. It was discussed and has been confirmed to be hosting six families and that as a result of that, the assessor will be charged with changing the building designation and trash services will be revoked.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a quick follow up on 166 Harmony St. which had a tallgrass complaint. However, it was discussed that officials had just seen the property on Sept. 1, and it had been properly cleaned up by BARC so at this point, the property was up to code.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The property at 916 Stafford Ave., the plaza that houses Dunphy’s Ice Cream, had several violations and issues that were brought to the table. These violations included a new HVAC unit installed without permit, grease being dumped in drains and heavily stained ceiling tiles, among others. There are reports of a potential tenant looking to move into a living space at the location, among all of these ongoing issues.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A multi-family unit on 110 High St. was also brought up for having mold near the bathrooms and bedrooms of Unit 3 but also a lack of smoke and carbon dioxide detectors. The fire department did mention that they inspected this property two months ago and all units had the detectors that they needed so they will have to follow up on this. It was also mentioned that this property was built prior to 1978.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are apartments on Union Street that have had several inspections through July and August due to raw sewage leakage and cockroach infestations. The police have also responded to calls to this property several times recently about cars being broken into.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The property at 243 Riverside Ave. has been bought by developers, and they are looking to place a fuel cell there that could eventually house a data storage center.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
