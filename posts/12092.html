<p>When TBE Editor Dave Fortier announced our first ever fund-raising campaign on Sunday, the writing staff never imagined the support we would get from all over Bristol and the entire United States. Here is just a smattering of the notes and letters we received yesterday and today.</p>

<p>Dear TBE, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am writing to wish you all the best in your fund-raising launch. It is so important for Bristol to have a newspaper that tells Bristol’s stories, not New Britain’s and Southington’s. I only wish I could afford to give more, but here is my pledge for $6.00 per month.</p>

<p>Dear TBE,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was shown Dave’s request on my flight home from Poland. I wish you the best and am sending a one-time pledge of $100.00. TBE is my second read each day after the Washington Post. When I first served in the Senate, Herbert Hoover was President and $100.00 was a big deal. Good luck, TBE,</p>

<p>Dear TBE,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would be happy to support your paper, but first I have to ask you a favor. Could you pleese annonce that I was the winner of the 2020 Presidential election in Connecticut, but 600,000 votes for me were stolen in Brisdgeport. You do that, and I will gladly pledge $6,000,000.00 a week. Good luck collecting, though.</p>

<p>Dear TBE,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for the great coverage of the Bristol Central Boys Basketball state championship journey in the TBE. The articles and the photos were awesome. Also, I would like to announce that I have hired Michael Letendre as my agent to begin my college career. I pledge to donate 10% of my future earnings to TBE, of which 0% can go to Mr. Letendre to equal his present salary.</p>

<p>Dear TBE,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been a loyal reader from the start. I will be happy to send a donation. I do have to say, though, that you should publish more stories from Jack Krampitz. He is obviously a better reporter than the other shmucks on your staff. Just saying.</p>
