<p>BRISTOL - The third quarter did not go the way the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team had envisioned against Berlin on Monday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats were one point ahead of the Lancers at the half before Berlin used a 14-5 third period burst to cruise to a 45-30 victory over Eastern in a CCC South showdown from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin improved to 3-4 overall while Eastern fell to 2-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, after belting St. Joseph for 13 points, 20 rebounds and eight blocked shots last week, Autumn Udoh had another impressive showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first year talent notched a game-high tying 15 points while Taigan Parent zipped in 12 – draining four three-pointers along the way – as the duo combined for 27 of the team’s 30 total points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin’s Brooke Walker led her charges with 15 points while Emma Ellison and Kailee DeMaio each kicked in nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was close over the opening stanza as a slow start kept the score in single digits throughout the first eight minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was 6-6 after one period of play as Walker kicked in a big 3 over the closing seconds of the frame to knot things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters were down just one over the closing ticks of the second quarter before an offensive rebound and put-back by Walker gave the Redcoats a 19-16 push at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern was still in it, trailing by just a single possession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third stanza saw the visiting aggression scoop up an early eight point edge but when Parent canned one of her many three-pointers, it was just a 26-21 game as the Lancers were charging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Berlin ended the third with a 9-0 sprint and going into the final period of play, the visiting aggression was in control at 35-21 – cruising to the eventual 15-point triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back in action on Wednesday, squaring off against New Britain from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 6 p.m.</p>
