<p>Retired First Sergeant Dave Carello explained to the audience the origins of Veterans’ Day, which began with the signing of the armistice, or the cease of hostilities, between the armies involved in World War I. That document was signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, and every November 11th thereafter that event was remembered. In 1926, it officially received the title of Armistice Day, with the hope that it would help us all to remember the day the “war to end all wars” came to a close.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, only a few years later, the world was embroiled in another war. Sixteen and a half million Americans would end up participating in World War II, and 407,000 would die serving their country. <br></p>

<p>In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill that officially changed Armistice Day to Veterans Day, thus honoring all veterans from every war and era. And the tradition continues every November 11th as it did on Friday.</p>

<p>Another highlight of the ceremony was the reading of the list of Bristol veterans who died during the past year from last Veterans’ Day to now. Students from the three local high schools read a list of 157 veterans who passed away.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The anthems of all the branches of the military were played for the audience and the vets from each branch stood during their rendition to a resounding round of applause.</p>

<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano spoke briefly on the importance of the day. He reminded everyone that “We get overwhelmed by the emotions and the difficult things. We have to remember that there is a greater good, and I cannot be more proud of the way that people put on a uniform and protect strangers and fight for our freedoms and liberties.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
