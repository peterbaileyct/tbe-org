<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to the special edition article for The Bristol Edition! This one needed to be released today in order to hype up all of the July events! Get your favorite drink, cool off and get ready of a sizzling take on the debut events in Pokemon Go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokémon GO July 2024 events schedule is here, and it is one of the busiest months ever! Here are all the Events, Spotlight Hours, Raid Hours, and Community Days that take place during the month of July 2024 in Pokémon GO. We also list out all the Raid bosses and PokéStop Showcases that are available throughout the month.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As things warmup for the massive GO Fest 2024 Global event, a new threat is on the horizon: Ultra Beasts are attacking our home once again. Fight off the Ultra Beasts in this exciting Raiding focused event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During July 2024, all of the Ultra Beasts, Articuno and Tornadus will be available during different time periods. There are additional Raids that take place during the GO Fest 2024 Global weekend, July 13 and 14, but those are listed separately after this section.</p>

<p>Ultra Beasts and Necrozma caught in Raids between July 8 and July 15 may have an Ultra Wormhole-inspired Special Background, if you are lucky.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
