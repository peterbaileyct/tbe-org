<p>ENFIELD – The Enfield American Legion baseball team led wire-to-wire against Bristol over a Zone 3 clash on Monday afternoon, zipping up a 13-3 mercy-ruled finish in five innings of play from Powder Hollow Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams moved to 10-11 after the completion of the game and each program will play into the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday was the final day of American Legion regular season baseball in the state of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 just didn’t have it that afternoon in Enfield, trimming an early deficit to a one-run game before the home squad notched the final nine runs of the showdown to ice the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The team can hit a little bit,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Enfield. “They have some hitters. They have some big guys over there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braiden Alaimo smacked out a solo home run while a blistering triple by Canon Marshall turned a slim 4-3 lead into a big 7-3 push for Post 80 through two completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 never got back into contention of that huge Marshall tally but Bristol pitcher Ryan Maglio battled none-the-less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio was hampered by a bit of an injury but still went four innings, fanning five, while trying to keep things close early.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evan Daly, who won the game for Enfield, was shaky but never entirely lost his composure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Errors, a couple timely hits and aggressive baserunning fueled Enfield early as the squad notched four first inning runs to capture a quick 4-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Bristol nearly drew even in the top of the second, dropping in three runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Bristol’s Jaylen Churchill walked, Connor Cyr zipped out a single to left and off a botched pickoff play at first base, Churchill scored to trim the deficit to 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr got to third on the error and when Caleb Molinsky earned a base-on-balls, Bristol had runners on the corners – ready for the vaunted ‘Bristol pickle.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the play turned extremely sour – instead of dill – as Molinsky did a nice job dancing in-between the first and second base bags but the ball was eventually fired into home plate just in time to get a charging Cyr as the game remained a 4-1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Josh Dunne walked and with two on, Joe Dunne absolutely drained a single down the third base line – clearing the bags – to make it a 4-3 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dunne kind of stopped running going into second base and was eventually tagged out as Post 2 was in it, down by a single run through an inning-and-a-half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Dominic Kohler walked but Maglio struck out the next two batters, nearly getting out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alaimo was then intentionally walked and when Jayden Maynard also nabbed a base-on-balls, the deck was set for Marshall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marshall, a 6-foot-4 shortstop that was scooping up everything defensively, absolutely canned a three-base hit to right as the ball just kept on carrying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His triple stole the momentum of the game, scoring all three runners, as Enfield reassumed control at 7-3 through two. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We needed to play really well,” said LaPenta. “Ryan needed to be on his ‘A’ game because they can really hit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 tallied just two more hits for the rest of the way, a single to right field by Gabe White and an infield hit by speedster Elliot Norris, but the visitors were not able to tally another run on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio allowed just one walk in the third frame to keep it a 7-3 game but in the fourth, Enfield started to pull away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alaimo cracked a homer to left centerfield and an RBI single by Brandon Rowe made it a 9-3 contest heading into the fifth and final frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Dunne and Norris each threw some pitches to close the contest out but four runs later, which included RBI doubles by Tyler Nickerson and Maynard, a sac fly from Alaimo and finally, an RBI single by Rowe ended the contest as Bristol fell by the mercy rule, 13-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made a little punch back there, made it 4-3,” said LaPenta. “But I could just tell Mags didn’t have his normal stuff. And I really didn’t want to use Caleb [Molinsky] unless we got back into it because he only has three innings left to pitch with us [at the 19U level]. If he pitched more, then he couldn’t play for the juniors.”</p>

<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>After the game, the thought was Bristol was done for the season. Instead, at 10-11, Post 2 actually ended up qualifying for the postseason tournament as the 18<sup>th</sup> seed, playing in the Southern bracket. The opponent? Try a rematch against No. 15 South Windsor – a squad Bristol no-hit on Saturday but Post 2 lost 1-0. The contest between the squads takes place on Wednesday from Rotary Field in South Windsor at 6:30 p.m. Frankly, this is a no-miss event as the teams were 1-1 against one another over two chippy regular season games. And it was extremely chippy last Saturday in South Windsor by the time things were said and done.</p>
