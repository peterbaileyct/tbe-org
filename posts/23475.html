<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;Like most of the public scholastic basketball programs in town, the Bristol Eastern boys team celebrated its lone senior before the start of the Bristol Central showdown last Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters honored Nate Fries before the showdown, getting a fantastic ovation for his efforts over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries has been a solid contributor to the Lancers’ 10-10 ledger this season - a run that’s allowed the program to qualify for the state tournament for the first time since 2014-15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries has been in the starting lineup in every game he’s played, posting averages of 3.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.0 steal-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray named Fries a tri-captain, joining the junior duo of Brayden Dauphinais and Lukas Sward in that capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been one of the leaders of the squad all season long and midway through things, Eastern coach Bunty Ray made a change in regard to Fries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought of making him a captain halfway through, he earned that,” said Ray of Fries. “He earned that leadership role. He gives us a lot of effort out there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 5.0 rebounds-per-game ranks him second on the squad and the combo guard/forward has been consistent as any player who takes the floor at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries opened the season with a nine point and five rebound performance against Plainville over the Lancers 54-24 blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had more big games along the way, snaring five points and seven rebounds in Eastern’s big 61-51 win at Berlin on January 2 while draining three 3-pointers for a career-high 11 points and three steals as the Lancers fell at Platt to end the month of January.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries nabbed five big rebounds as Eastern held off scrappy&nbsp;<br>Plainville on February 10 and then roasted South Windsor for six points and nine rebounds to get Eastern its tenth victory of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his final regular season game, in Eastern’s 59-52 setback against Central, Fries scooped up five points and four rebounds - making his 20th start of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m glad to start him every night,” said Ray. “When I have to make substitutions or changes, he’s out there. He’s a great team guy and does what he can out there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fries has made an excellent accounting of himself this season at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior was able to lead his squad back to the postseason for the first time since 2015 and in the wide-open Division IV bracket, anything is possible for Fries and the Bristol Eastern boys basketball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nobody wants to lose on senior night at their last [home] game but I’ll tell you this, he’s got another game,” said Ray. “That hasn’t happened here in a long time, so you’ve got to give him some credit for that too.” <br></p>
