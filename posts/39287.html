<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - The city series confrontation between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys basketball teams is certainly an intriguing one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams meet tonight in the final game of the Bristol Central Holiday Classic for the first time in 2023-24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs have extreme similarities and, of course, multiple differences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adding a little more hype to this outstanding matchup, there’s a couple additional items to consider as game time approaches:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do the two schools have in common?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs have yet to play a game from home, believe it or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to the schedule maker, ‘Gas Guzzling’ Dave Greenleaf (you’ve earned your fate, sir), the Rams and Lancers have started all of their games on the road – six total in all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has never happened before, at least for Eastern, who won’t have a home game until January 5 against Tolland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give credit to the Bristol programs as they’ve combined for a 4-2 overall ledger through six games and are undefeated against the teams from Meriden (Maloney and Platt).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what a way for Central to make its 2023-24 home debut – squaring off against rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re going to give us their best shot,” said Eastern coach Ray of Central. “It’s going to be a different game than [the most recent one at Platt] for sure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do the two schools&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>have in common?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Eastern is an experienced crew, taking its lumps over the years and expects 2023-24 to be its year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three games, the Lancers are averaging 67.0 points-per-game – the most since 1993-94 (68.0 points-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a small sample space but at the current rate, those numbers puts the team’s scoring in line with that talented crew from Ray’s senior year (18-4 overall record, CCC South champs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Lancers allow opponents just 53.3 ppg on 37-percent shooting from the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central averages about five points less than that average but Barrette and company are going to bring the defense and expect this game to be a real mess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One last thing, when it comes to BC/BE confrontations, throw all the records out the window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, you can disregard everything that has been written about this game due to that very fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Coach Barrette will have them ready,” said Ray. “Our job is to go out and just execute, stay healthy and do the things that we need to do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be a fun game so buckle up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Streak:&nbsp;</strong>Over the last ten games, Central has won eight of those bouts. The Lancers’ two wins against the Rams have been by a combined 11 points. The programs split the season series last year, winning in the opponent’s gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here’s how the scores have gone over the past ten games between Central and Eastern:</strong></p>
