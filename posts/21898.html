<p>In the spring of 1965, a young session musician named Jeff Beck stepped into the role of lead guitar player for the Yardbirds and revolutionized the world of rock n’ roll.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During his nearly two-year tenure with the notorious blues rock band, Beck recorded some of the band’s most recognizable hits including “Shapes of Things” and “Over Under Sideways Down.” Beck’s wailing riffs and feedback-drenched solos gave the Yardbirds a groundbreaking psychedelic sound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following his departure from the Yardbirds, Beck joined forces with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood to form the Jeff Beck Group. The band released two albums: “Truth” and “Beck-Ola,” the latter of which was extremely well received by fans. The group disbanded in 1969 following their fifth U.S. Tour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beck reformed the group with four new musicians, including drummer Cozy Powell in late 1970. The band released the albums “Rough and Ready” and “Jeff Beck Group” before disbanding in 1972.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beck’s jazz fusion album “Blow by Blow” was released in 1975 to mainstream success, rocketing to #4 on the United States Billboard 200. The album, which featured “’Cause We’ve Ended As Lovers” and Freeway Jam,” is Beck’s highest-charting album of all time.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beck continued testing the limits of the guitar throughout his career, collaborating with many of the greatest rock musicians of all time.&nbsp;After more than five decades of recording, Beck died from bacterial meningitis on Jan. 10.&nbsp;His career earned him the #5 spot on Rolling Stone's <em>100 Greatest Guitarists</em>. His legendary style combined a mastery of the whammy bar, fingerpicking, oblique bends and legato phrasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
