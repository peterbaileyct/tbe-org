<p>The 11 annual Craft Fair, sponsored by the Bristol Senior Center, will be held this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 25 and 26 in the senior center gymnasium.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"What's new this year," said Jaimie Clout, BSC assistant directory, "is that we are jam packed with vendors. Not only is our gymnasium full, but our Saturday-only dining room vendor hall is nearly full as well. Meaning we have over 65 vendors, which are record numbers for BSC."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fair features unique crafts, such as, jewelry, quilts, stained glass, knitted and baked goods, Christmas items, books by area authors and gifts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our crafters here at the center represent our woodshop, knitting group, photography group, advocacy groups, as well as some of our volunteers," Clout said. "There are at least three of our members that will have vendor space in the gymnasium. Most of our 'in-house' crafts will be featured along the corridors."</p>

<p>In addition to the vendors, senior crafts will be displayed in the hallways and outside of the woodshop and knitters' room. There will be a bake sale table and the BSC coffee shop will be selling simply sandwiches.</p>

<p>Clout cautioned that parking will be limited as there is construction going on at the site.</p>

<p>"We kindly ask that those interested in visiting us to come with a friend and to be patient with us and we are doing the best we can to manage the space," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Profits from the annual event typically raise $2,500 that subsidizes programs and special events for the center's over 5,500 members, she said.</p>

<p><strong>The senior center is a busy place</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In September, the senior center held its pasta supper fundraiser, which was sold out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The annual heath and information fair, at the end of the month, was well attended as the vendors offered many areas of expertise, including free blood pressure, hearing and foot care. Many experts are available to provide information to guide you, as well as instruction pamphlets.</p>
