<p>BRISTOL - The roster for the Bristol Senior American Legion Baseball team has a good mixture of players and the ultimate goal is a Zone 1 championship by the completion of the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I like the team," said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of his squad. "There's pretty good chemistry, a good group."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s some firepower from the mound with the return of veterans like Roberto Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a bulldog who doesn’t yield much in terms of earned runs, throws strikes, and has been one of the most successful pitchers for the program in recent memory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz is one of several 19 year old’s coming back to the fold for one more go of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several of those players did not play a collegiate season this past spring but bring needed experience, talent and ability to the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar will also be one of the featured arms on the roster this year, already throwing twice for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Lozier (Avery Point, .253 batting average, four HR’s, 27 RBI) was an everyday player for the squad in Groton. He didn’t pitch collegiately but can for Post 2 while Dylan Woodsome (outfield) also can toss an inning or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron (third base), Ryan Fradette (centerfield), Dillon Hudson (shortstop/second base), Tyler Martin (second base), Chris Osuch (catcher), and Tyler Stickels (infield/outfield) are a very experienced group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the mix are players that just came off their scholastic seasons including Bristol Central’s Bryan Capezzone (outfield/second base), and Bristol Eastern’s Elliot Norris (shortstop/second base) and Jayden Churchill (infield/pitcher).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Capezzone helped the Rams get to the state tournament once again while Norris and Churchill had quality seasons for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris batted .273 with 18 hits, eight RBI, along with eight stolen bases while Churchill was one of Eastern’s top players and leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He batted .328, blasted out 22 hits – eight for extra-bases – added 12 walks, and scooped up 14 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill was the team-leader in steals (nine), brings plenty of speed to the game and on the mound, he was 2-1 with an ERA just over 5.00 for the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dual rostered players for Bristol include Michael Roalf (pitcher/shortstop), Ryan Maglio (pitcher/infield), Connor Cyr (IF/OF), and Rio Fernandez (catcher).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Counting on some pitching from Canzellarini</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta has high hopes for pitcher Alex Canzellarini, another veteran arm for the Bristol roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His broke his finger before the start of the Bristol Eastern baseball campaign in 2021 and never was able to get into the flow scholastically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last summer, Post 2 saw bits and pieces of what he could bring to the squad over several relief appearances.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I was really happy the way Alex pitched” said LaPenta of Canzellarini’s stint against West Hartford on Monday. "He threw really well. He's got stuff [to throw]. He just needs to get confidence between his ears. If we can get him to throw, because his ball moves crazy, with his fastball. He's got a two-seamer [which will help the team]."&nbsp;</p>
