<p>BRISTOL – Are the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys track teams on a collision course for a CCC South Championship showdown when May 16 rolls around?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a couple more events in between now before the Rams and Lancers meet in CCC South action but to end the month of April, the Lancers have been on a real hot streak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the winning continued on Tuesday as Eastern clipped Lewis Mills by an 85-64 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the stars came out to shine that afternoon, which included sprinting phenom Rayshon Andrews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speedster ended up seizing first place in four different events on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 100 meters in 11.07 seconds while winning the 200 meters in an incredible 22.26 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrews also took the long jump with a leap of 19 feet and half an inch while also helping Eastern capture the win in the 4x100 meter relay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum had another good day in the pit, grabbing first place in the challenging triple jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His successful make of 41 feet, 5.5 inches was the benchmark of the afternoon and in the high jump, Benjamin Kozikowski nabbed a big win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozikowski took the event with a make of five feet, four inches while also in the field, Phoenix Diaz won the discus in 113 feet, six inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Shorette dominated the javelin, hitting a mark of 125 feet, seven inches for the win while Eastern cleared victories over both the 4x100 and 4x800 meter relay events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100, the combination of Preston Poirier, Justin Sanchez, Dylan Bartucca, and Andrews finished in 45.28 seconds and in the 4x800, Dominic Tartarelli, Jase Koczur, Brendan Tartarelli and Jack Mulcunry crossed the line in 8:33.40 to snare the win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, Eastern has double-tough Middletown on Tuesday in another CCC South engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m. in Middletown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And peaking around the corner, the Central/Eastern showdown takes place on May 16 (3:45 p.m.) from the track and field at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will that be the day the CCC South championship will finally be decided?&nbsp;</p>
