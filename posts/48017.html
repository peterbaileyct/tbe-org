<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to the Go Fest edition of The Bristol Edition! This one will focus on the two biggest events for Pokémon Go this month: Go Fest New York and Global Go Fest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will share some key tips to have the best experience available!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you get to the event, make sure you Update your Pokémon GO app and download all assets while you have a Wi-Fi connection to save your data. This will help with any issues that may pop up during your events. Also, add an additional login method to your Pokémon GO account. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adding another login method will help ensure you can keep playing during the event even if there’s an issue with your regular login method. Finally, grab your tickets early and register for the event before you go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are going to travel to Randall’s Island, here are some things you need to know the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferries will depart from and return to the East 35th Street Ferry Landing located at the intersection of East 35th St. and FDR Drive. They will travel to and from Randall’s Island all weekend long, running from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Tickets are first-come, first-served, and must be purchased prior to boarding. here is no parking for personal vehicles on Randall’s Island and rideshare services will NOT be able to drop-off on Randall’s Island (if you have a satellite truck/media van, please let us know and we can make special arrangements).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now for the Pokémon! Here are the encounters you will see throughout the event:</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
