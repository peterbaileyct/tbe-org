<p>Surrounding streets may also experience a period of low water pressure. When the water is turned back, it may be discolored. If this happens, residents are asked to run an outside faucet or bathtub until the water clears.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A water filling station is located at the Water Filtration Plant and is available to any residents who are affected by an extended service interruption 24 hours a day/7 days a week. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no charge to customers affected by the water service interruption for using the water filling station. Customers will need to bring their own containers and Filtration Plant Operators will assist in filling them. </p>

<p>The Water Filtration Plant is located at 1080 Terryville Ave. and the number to the plant is (860) 583-6504. Residents are asked to call the plant in advance of arrival.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
