<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse squad went 1-1 in CCC Tournament play this past week with Class M state tournament action commencing on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second ranked Lancers opened the CCC fray with a slick 8-7 victory over No. 3 Wethersfield on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first postseason victory in school history for the Kingstreeters while Emma Stavens kept up her scoring exploits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in a hat trick while teammate Vanessa Drury added two goals to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenzie Aparo also nabbed two goals while Sarah Hartley scored as well to complete the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was some excellent defense by keeper Avery Ellis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The official tally was that Ellis stopped somewhere around a million shots, earning some big saves along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was a big deal because Wethersfield kept its collective feet on the gas until the final buzzer sounded, losing by a single goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the CCC Central Division Finals on Thursday, Eastern took on Lewis Mills for the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Spartans got the best of the Kingstreeters, snatching an 18-7 win from Lewis Mills High School in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC Tournament was a good state playoff test for the Lancers, taking on some very good competition on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens was at it again, plastering in four goals to lead the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She now has 66 goals going into Class M play which is a new single season scoring record at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury kicked in another two goals while Hartley added a goal to go along with two assists over the losing effort.</p>
