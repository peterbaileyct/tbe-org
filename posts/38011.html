<p>In Feb. 1941, C. Company 169 out of the Bristol Armory, a National Guard unit, was federalized by President Roosevelt to begin a one-year training program at Camp Blanding. The members of C Company put their lives on hold. They packed up and traveled south to begin their training leaving their family and friends behind.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They began training in case war broke out, and on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, it did. The guardsmen were activated into the regular Army. They continued to train and in August 1942 they boarded ships to the Pacific front. Those not killed or wounded were unable to return to Bristol until after the war ended.</p>

<p> Members of C. Company 169<sup>th</sup> fought in New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, and Rendova and on to Luzon.</p>

<p> The post would like to know about these individuals, what they did before the war and after the war but also to be part of the Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day ceremonies that are being planned later this week.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
