<p>The Bristol Police Department held a ceremony Friday to honor the memory of Sgt. Alex Hamzy and Lt. Dustin DeMonte, who were killed in the line of duty on Oct. 12, 2022. Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of the tragic shooting that also severely injured Officer Alec Iurato.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The door display will serve as a testament to our commitment as an agency to never forget the sacrifice that Dustin and Alex made on Oct. 12, 2022,” Police Chief Mark Morello said during the ceremony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It also serves as a reminder of the bonds that our agency has with our Bristol community. To the Demonte and Hamzy families, we hope that there's some comfort in knowing that Dustin and Alex will forever be remembered and forever in our hearts.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The memorial, prominently displayed in the department's lobby, features the preserved doors of a police cruiser that stood outside the Bristol Police station from Oct. 12, 2022, to Jan. 23, 2023. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thousands came to pay their respects to the fallen officers by surrounding the cruiser with an outpouring of flowers, cards, balloons, letters, and candles. Hundreds of residents left messages of love and gratitude for the fallen officers and the Bristol Police Department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Morello requested a moment of silence in remembrance of Lt. DeMonte, Sgt. Hamzy and all law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in service to their communities.</p>

<p>“Over the two years, I really appreciate what the community has done to come together to not only support our two families, and there are members from both those families here, so my heart and prayers still go out to the Demonte and Hamzy and families,” Caggiano said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Bristol strong community has done an unbelievable job to support those families and the rest of our police officers and I'm proud to say that they've been very resilient.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano said there is a similar memorial of the other two doors upstairs in the police training room.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s important to take time to remember these brave men,” said Bristol resident Anne-Marie Desroberts. “They’re heroes and I’m glad to see the community come together for them.”</p>
