<p>For mayor, voters have the choice between incumbent Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano (R) and challenger Scott Rosado (D). Responses to TBE questions from Rosado are listed below. Caggiano did not respond. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answers to the questions appear just as the candidate stated, with the exception of minor copy editing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Questions for incumbents are slightly different from those of challengers.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have seen the current administration putting their own personal agendas ahead of Bristol’s best interests. They constantly take credit for work done by others. Mayor Caggiano recently stated that he is the reason Wheeler Clinic is downtown. The prior administration that I was a part of brought Wheeler Clinic downtown and handed it to the current administration on a silver platter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the current administration is neglecting the work done by our prior administration. Specifically, the opioid taskforce and diversity council that have both seen a lack of support by this administration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a part of developing the diversity council and the opioid taskforce when I served on the City Council and I dedicated myself to ensuring their success. Now, the lack of support for this is a driving factor in my run for Mayor. I will ensure important commissions and boards like these are fully supported and provided with the necessary resources to positively impact our community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies you for office?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's my belief that “political credentials” are unnecessary to run for an elected office. My passion to help others and put people over politics is what makes me suited for the office of Mayor. I have over 35 years experience owning and operating businesses which provides the knowledge on managing people, budgets and operations that is needed to run the city. I grew my family’s home health business from 50 to over 700 employees. I have been actively involved in the Bristol community for years, serving as the President of the Bristol Boys &amp; Girls Club, and working with our veterans and our youth. In my time on the City Council, I served on the Aging Commission, Parks Board, Veterans Council, Opioid Taskforce, Police Commission, Diversity Council and Youth Commission. I am also a US Navy Veteran.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Bristol. I have lived here my whole life and raised my family here. That being said, I am seeing that the current administration is reaching a point with the projects our former administration started that we will soon see development halt. There are no new major projects in the pipeline to continuously drive our economic growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The prior administration that I was proud to serve on started Bristol Works which the current mayor is trying to take credit for. We started the Wheeler Health project and had it at a point where a vote and some signatures were all that were left to do but the current administration voted it down before being pressured by the public outcry to approve with minor location changes. These are just a few examples to note.</p>

<p><strong>What lies ahead for you the next two years if elected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
