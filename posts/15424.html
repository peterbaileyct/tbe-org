<p>Benedict Carmen Vetrano, Jr., 82, of Bristol, died on Friday, July 29. Ben was born April 29, 1940, in Bristol and was the only child of the late Isabel (Audiano) and Benedict C. Vetrano, Sr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben grew up in Bristol and attended St. Anthony’s School, where he graduated from high school. Ben continued his education at Villanova University and ran the family business, B. Vetrano Inc, one of the first beer distributors in Connecticut, until 2001.&nbsp;Ben married the love of his life, Catherine Marie (Conlon) Vetrano, on July 21, 1962. Nothing was more beautiful to watch than Ben’s unwavering love and complete devotion to Cathy. Ben and Cathy made their home in Bristol, celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary just last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his earlier years, Ben enjoyed playing a nightly round of golf in the evening with his son, John, and listening to music played by his daughter, Lisa. Cocktail hour was a nightly ritual with his wife, Cathy, enjoying music and sipping on Ballentine Ale. He always loved watching college sports, and you could always count on him to cheer on the Syracuse, Villanova, and Auburn teams, especially during basketball and football season. He enjoyed Sunday family dinners and cooking with his grandchildren.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ben was reliable, kind, caring, and absolutely committed to family, ensuring that all knew of his support and love in his efforts to help them achieve their highest potential. Ben could always be found doing what he loved most: spending time with&nbsp;<em>La Famiglia,&nbsp;</em>his family. </p>

Nothing gave Ben greater joy and pride than spending time with his grandchildren: Matthew Benedict, Andrew, and Jessica Vetrano of West Simsbury, and Elizabeth and Sarah Nardone of Lexington, Mass.&nbsp;</p>
