<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central softball program has an extremely busy week ahead of it - a slate of four games concluding with a crosstown battle at Bristol Eastern (Friday, 3:45 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some programs would be a bit anxious with a schedule like that but not the Rams and its ace duo in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re an opponent going up against Central, you’ll eventually have to tangle against pitchers Alex Sciarretto or Sophia Torreso - this year <em>and </em>next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whichever pitcher Central coach Monica Hayes decides to employ, it’s always a long day in the batter’s box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about what Sciarretto, a CCC South All-Conference selection last season, accomplished just against Hall last week on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to Hall by a 2-1 final but Sciarretto chucked just a four-hitter, struck out 11 - many of those batters watching strike three - while just issuing two free passes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought that she was excellent,” said Hayes about Sciarretto after the Hall game. “She’s clearly getting better. She’s improving in those tight situations and that’s good for her.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s impressive.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Errors fueled Hall’s win because Sciarretto, who truly had to deal with all the elements - including the cold - more than held her own in the one-run loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The miscues in the field were the ultimate daggers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, if Torreso was throwing instead, is that any better than Sciarretto chucking changeups by hapless batters?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso has struck out 10-plus batters on several occasions and, like her sister Gwen, she isn’t afraid of a pressure-filled situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when one pitcher isn’t throwing, the other is taking charge somewhere in the infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have two aces,” said Hayes. “We have solid pitching no matter who we throw.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, defense was the program’s calling card and not much has changed in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams entered the busy week at 7-2 and needed just one win to qualify for states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not a forgone conclusion but don’t bet against Central this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s two losses has been by a combined two runs as the lack of a big hit against Plainville and Hall foiled possible winning efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the other game we lost [at Plainville], we were one hit away in the first game of the season at Plainville,” said Hayes. “In tight games, we seemed to struggle with that. But that’s something we learned today [against Hall]. We were one hit away. We’re almost there in a tight game against a really good team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s line-up is pretty much stacked in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaley Laird is tough at shortstop while Sam Sklenka helps lead the charge in the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorelei Stancavage does a tremendous job behind the plate and there’s another talented Sklenka - this time Leah - playing in the outfield as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the bottom of the order, Sarah Romano, Mya Porrini, and Adrianna Lubrico are all invaluable contributors to the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this team has the capability to beat any squad in the Central Connecticut Conference as the Rams have a tough interdivisional slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Central opens with Manchester on Monday and then plays non-conference foe Wolcott the following day in back-to-back home games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a third straight contest, the Rams travels to Windsor for a CCC interdivisional tilt and finally, it’s Central/Eastern on Friday from King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central has a chance to run the table this week if everything works out, starting with Sciarretto and Torreso ready to pitch all the big innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In close games against quality teams, we’re competing,” said Hayes. “I like our chances against a lot of teams in the state. I like our chances against a lot of the teams in the CCC.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know we’re going to be competitive. It’s just a matter of offensively executing and defensively, we have to limit our errors and mistakes.”</p>
