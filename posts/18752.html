<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Activity in the city of Bristol basically came to a stop on Friday as everyone focused on the funeral of our two fallen heroes, Lieutenant Dustin Demonte and Sergeant Alex Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The funeral was scheduled to take place at 11:00 at Rentschler Field in East Hartford. Both officers were transported by procession from their funeral homes at  9:00, Officer Hamzy from Terryville and Officer Demonte from North Haven. The two processions merged at the Route 6 interchange in West Hartford  and combined as one to East Hartford. The line of cruisers and motorcycles seemed to stretch for miles.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thousands lined the procession route to pay their final respects to the officers, and it was estimated that more than 15,000 were expected to attend the funeral at the stadium. Police officers from all over New England and even as far south as Florida and as far west as California were in attendance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol school system closed for the day, and Bristol City Hall was also closed. During the day, more mourners gathered at the police car memorial in front of City Hall, and flowers covered the cruiser there so that it almost disappeared from sight.</p>
