<p>BRISTOL - Regardless of what happens this week, the softball program from Bristol Central has taken centerstage over postseason play and teams across the state have taken notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have been a top-five program in Class LL all season long behind two All-State level pitchers and a defense to match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the final week of scholastic softball season, Central continues to play - and compete - at an elite level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, a victory in the semifinal round against No. 1 Danbury would send Central to its sixth ever state title game and first championship contest since 2005.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at Central’s upcoming showdown against the Hatters from Danbury:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class LL Semifinal - No. 1 Danbury (23-2) versus No. 5 Bristol Central (21-4)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Deluca Field, Stratford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When: </strong>Monday, June 6</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Road to the semis (Danbury)</strong>: The top-ranked Hatters, by virtue of its 19-1 regular season record, earned a bye in Class LL first round play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two postseason games, runs have been a premium for opposing teams as Danbury allowed only three (1.5 runs allowed-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t easy as Danbury had to play extra-inning games in both the second and quarterfinal rounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 16 Shelton lost to the Hatters in eight innings (3-1) back on June 1 while two days later, No. 8 West Haven left it all on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Haven fell 5-2 in 12 innings, setting up Danbury for a seminal round war against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Road to the semis (Bristol Central)</strong>: The fifth ranked Rams have been playing like champs - even as rain tried to nix those postseason aspirations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In three playoff games, opponents are only averaging one run a game as pitchers Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto have simply been tough to generate hits off of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And credit the defense that’s been basically flawless over postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 28 Wilton (6-0) proved to be no match for Central on May 31 but two rain delays later, the Rams were able to knock off No. 12 Cheshire 3-1 and the following afternoon on Saturday, No. 13 Trumbull fell to the locals by four runs (6-2).</p>

<p><strong>Head Coaches</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Danbury - </strong>Erica Carboni</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central - </strong>Monica Hayes (a long time assistant and player for the softball program at BCHS)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Danbury - </strong>The Hatters play in the FCIAC</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central - </strong>We all know the Rams play in the ultra-competitive CCC</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll Rankings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Danbury - </strong>In the last poll from May 31, Danbury was ranked No. 6 and has been a staple in the rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central</strong> - Central wasn’t in the top-10 at all this year but did get enough votes for fourteenth place in that same poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s the Deal for the Rams?</strong> Central has the capability of beating any team when the squad is locked in defensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams sterling 21-4 ledger saw the squad lose two games (Plainville and Hall) by two combined runs while the other two setbacks were at the hands of Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central finished the regular season at 17-3 and won a share of the CCC South championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this year’s tremendous postseason run has surpassed the expectations of Hayes and her staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When the season started, I thought we were a quarterfinal team and I just said they proved me wrong,” said Hayes after the Trumbull victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team simply had a strong regular season showing with an ever-improving offense that matches it tremendous defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sklenka leads the charge in centerfield while Kaley Laird and Lorelei Stancavage spearheads the defense in the infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This postseason, Laird is batting .333 from the leadoff position while small-ball wizard Sam Sklenka is a slick 5-for-8 with four runs and has bunted the competition to death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Sklenka tallied three hits - including a big double - while Torreso batted a sterling .375 over the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the bottom of the order, Sciarretto, Sarah Romano, and Adrianna Lubrico have all produced something at the dish over the playoff run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chemistry wise, this team is playing its best ball of the season as the postseason is coming to a close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve just reached the semifinals and they’ve come together more and more as the season’s gone on,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you can put either Torreso or Sciarretto in the circle against Danbury because either pitcher could lead the Rams to the finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s the Deal for the [mad] Hatters?</strong> Danbury has dropped two of its last five games (both to Fairfield Ludlowe) as the program started the year a sizzling 18-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Kaylee Drago has been truly amazing for Danbury, hitting two consecutive game-winning home runs to help the Hatters get to the semifinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the circle, senior Haley Pucci has over 300 strikeouts while the battery is strong with Sophie Fenaroli behind the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, the combination of Fenaroli, Drago, and teammate Regan Lalor went a slick 8-for-14 against West Haven over that amazing 12-inning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the program’s first semifinal appearance since 1987 but if the Rams play a complete game, a victory over Danbury isn’t out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With its offense and defense clicking, Central is going to give Danbury fits on the field from Stratford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been able to execute more offensively,” said Hayes of the postseason run. “Defensively, we’ve been able to make more plays and be a little bit more efficient behind our pitchers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A local newspaper had Danbury, Glastonbury, Southington, and Fairfield Ludlowe picked as its final four in the Class LL bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, three out of four isn’t bad - leaving out Central (that fourth pick was Glastonbury which was a team the Rams could have faced).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are more than a worthy member of that final four and don’t be fooled: The Bristol Central softball team is ready for its turn at a Class LL title shot against Danbury.</p>
