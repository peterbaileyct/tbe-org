<p>I happened to be out and about late in January at the Bristol Bazaar. As I walked through the doors, on my left was a lovely smiling lady and her painted and created designs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graphic designer and artist Allison Munger was displaying her wood burned and painted artwork that includes blue jays, painted dogs, butterflies and digital coloring pages for all to see at a special guest vending day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was mesmerized so I struck up a conversation.</p>

<p>“I like your art,” I said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thanks,” she said and told me she creates her art in addition to working at a dentist office.&nbsp;Her art is Pop Art style with a lot of color and joy mixed together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Munger also does custom work like painting a particular dog breed upon request.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am working on a boxer.” she said and added that she mostly focuses on nature.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to her paintings, Munger said she has an idea in the works of publishing a dual coloring book--one coloring book for an adult with mandala designs, and a child’s version with a simpler picture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has digital nature coloring pages available for purchase now which includes pre-painted and unpainted single coloring pages. </p>

<p>Munger told me her digital and hand-painted art varies based on what she feels inspired to draw that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>"I listen to certain music that sort of goes with what I'm wanting to create," she said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
