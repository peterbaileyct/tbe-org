<p>WEST HARTFORD – The Bristol Swimming and Diving Coop had an excellent showing at the 2022 CIAC Class LL Championships on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the locals proved it could keep up with all the other big programs around the state in the pool from the Cornerstone Aquatics Center in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program ended the day as one of the top-10 finishers, placing ninth overall, as the team scored 245 points which was 18 better than Hamden (10<sup>th</sup> place, 227 points).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program also established a new school record along the way and some of those performers will be taking the pool on Saturday at the Connecticut State Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol’s Mikel Palaj had a tremendous day as he squared away a couple championship performances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior won the 50-yard freestyle, finishing the heat in 21 seconds to take the title and then in the 100-yard butterfly, the crafty Palaj was at it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seized the win in 50.29 seconds for the 100-yard championship as he ended the day as a dual title victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were additional top tier finishes from Bristol as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Nathan Stellmach earned third place in the 100-yard breaststroke, ending the race in under a minute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 58.69 seconds was just off the winning tally as Greenwich’s Aiden Bucaria (56.29) took the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol zipped up a sixth-place finish in the 200-yard medley relay as the combination of junior Davis Kroll, Stellmach, Palaj, and sophomore Aidan Collins ended the race in 1:41.46.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 400-yard freestyle relay, the Mum City foursome of Palaj, senior Noah Taylor, Kroll, and Stellmach placed eighth overall with a time of 3:20.39 – helping establish a new school record in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other action from around the pool, Stellmach seized ninth place in the 200-yard IM (2:00.17), junior Jedric Sutula was 19<sup>th</sup> in the diving event (241.75 points), Kroll was 18<sup>th</sup> in the 100-yard freestyle (51.17 seconds), and the combination of Collins, freshman Thomas Masotti, Taylor and Kroll scored a ninth-place finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay (1:35.68).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State swimming power Greenwich won the Class LL championship behind an 873-point showing while runner-up Ridgefield (569) was way off in the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2013, outside of the pandemic cancelled championship events, Greenwich has won every Class LL – and State Open – title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding out the top-five were Norwalk-McMahon (third, 538 points), Glastonbury (fourth, 424) and the North Haven Coop (fifth, 377).</p>
