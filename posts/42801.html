<p>The girls quickly dispatched St. James in a 42-9 rout. The team was led in scoring by Natalie Cox, while timely passing by Brooke Sattler and Ava Ricciardone led to many easy buckets. Emma Bernard played great defense on the block and in transition, and Abby Stavens had a great defensive game with many steals and pressures leading to turnovers resulting in points for St. Matthew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>St. Matt's then advanced to face Holy Trinity and emerged with an 31-14 victory. Natalie Cox, Brooke Sattlet and Ava Ricciardone led the offense, while Brielle Brayne was great in a supporting role -- playing outstanding defense. Abby Stavens again proved to be a formidable defensive player causing disruptions throughout the game.</p>

<p>The state championship game versus St James/ St Timothy out of West Hartford was a slugfest from the start. Defense by both teams made buckets hard to come by early. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually St. Timothy was able to break out with transition baskets and build a lead. St Matt's made a furious run at the start of the 4th quarter, but it was too much to overcome as the girls lost 34-19. </p>

<p>Coach John Stavens praised the girls on a tremendous effort throughout the year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The final was a tough loss after a great season. The girls were a great group and improved so much this season.”</p>
