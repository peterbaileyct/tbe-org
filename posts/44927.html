<p>The Bristol boys lacrosse Co-op program headed to Enfield Wednesday just two days after facing them at home Monday and came back home with a much closer decision in a 9-5 victory.</p>

<p>Bristol was led by Ian Reardon with three goals and six ground balls.&nbsp;In the process  Reardon came away with his 100th career point, coming on the heels of Brady Bell getting his 100th career point, a great accomplishment for both boys.</p>

<p>The Bristol squad was down four starters for the game, missing goalie Nick Martino, Aidan Collins, Chase Dauphinee and Dylan Brown.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A bunch of younger players stepped up in their absence, especially Tyghe Collins who had an assist and four ground balls. Brayden Dwyer also stepped up with two goals, two assists, and three ground balls.&nbsp; Jayden Glasper added two goals, an assist and six ground balls. Brady Bell was once again up to the task with two goals, three assists, and four ground balls. And Matteo DiMarco was a ground ball fiend as he came away with six on the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dwyer's dominance on the face-off allowed for Bristol to control possession throughout as he won 12 of 16. Vinny Howley again provided much relief in the cage stopping eight shots!</p>

<p>Bristol improves to an impressive 8-2 with the win. The team goes right at it again this afternoon, traveling to Maloney High School for a 3:45 match against the Meriden Co-op.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
