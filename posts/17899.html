<p>On Monday, Bristol Water and Sewer Department Superintendent Robert J. Longo announced the city will be restricting water usage on a voluntary basis since reservoirs are at 70 percent capacity, a press release from the mayor's office stated. The news was also announced on the Mayor's Facebook page.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Customers are being asked to limit the amount of outside water use and to abide by the odd/even watering system: properties with odd street numbers water on odd numbered days, those with even numbers on even numbered days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the odd/even watering system, the water and sewer department is requesting voluntary water use from the city's largest customers, including Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services, Public Works, golf courses and commercial businesses.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
