<p>The Lancers, led by Vanessa Drury and Autumn Udoh, poured in 32 points in the first quarter alone, and the game was never in doubt after those first eight minutes. Eastern jumped out to a 19-0 lead over first four or five minutes of play. Shelton called two time outs to try to stem the tide but had no anwers for the Lancer onslaught.</p>

<p>Udoh&nbsp;had 14 points in the first quarter, and was basically unstoppable. And Drury scored 15 of her 20 points in the first half, including 3 three's in the second quarter to put the final nails in the Shelton coffin.</p>

<p>The game was so one-sided that Eastern Coach Tony Floyd was relatively quiet during the contest, a shocking development to all Eastern fans in attendance. And the Lancer subs got to play substantial minutes.</p>

<p>Cassie Sward added 13 points to the Lancer ledger, including 3 three's of her own.</p>
