<p>It’s the big one on Wednesday for the Bristol Central softball team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the squad (16-2), winners of nine straight games, is heading to Southington (15-1) in what could be both a CCC and CIAC postseason tournament preview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 4:45 from the Southington varsity field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams come into the game completely on a tear, carrying the third longest winning streak in Class LL play behind Fairfield Ludlowe (18-1, winners of 14 straight) and Newtown (14-3, 10 consecutive wins).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, since losing to Hall back on April 28, has allowed just 11 total runs over that nine game winning streak as pitchers Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto have been racking up the Ks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Knights are one of the top four squads in the state and its only setback is a 6-0 loss on the road to Masuk of Monroe - also one of the best in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since defeating Avon (15-6) back on April 22, Southington has allowed opponents only 12 total runs and just half of those belonged to CCC competitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is currently fourth in CIAC Class LL standings while Southington is one spot ahead in third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a CCC Interdivisional confrontation that shouldn’t be missed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The warm-up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had a tremendous week, playing just about every day - six games in a row in fact - and had plenty of momentum when the squad showed up at South Windsor on Monday, leading to a huge 6-1 victory in CCC Interdivisional play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the plate Adrianna Lubrico, Mya Porrini, Sam Sklenka and Sciarretto all made the ball fly around the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the circle, Torreso scooped up 17 strikeouts, leading to just the one run.</p>
