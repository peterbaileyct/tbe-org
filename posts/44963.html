<p><strong>Bristol on the tube</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever I see a Bristol native on TV, usually for the first time, I like to mention that fact here. Thus, today’s column talks about a young man from a very talented sports family. It’s a sophomore left-handed batter and hurler Gavin Greger, who I had mentioned before is playing for UConn after transferring from Bryant University. Welcome back to the Nutmeg State, Mr. Greger. It was neat seeing you in action on TV in last week’s re-broadcast of that game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greger is the son of Bristol firefighter Dory Greger and his wife, Sandi. Small world, Dory was an All-Star player for the Red Sox in the former Edgewood Little League. My son, Jamie, was also an All-Star for the team, coached by a Mr. Tufts. Gavin is 6-0, 190 pounds, played 39 games, batted .252, hit two homers, 21 RBI, scored 28 runs and pilfered 11 bases while wearing uniform No. 7 on his shirt. Yes, this is Bill and Fran’s grandson.</p>

<p>I’m told that there will be a convenience store, fast food drive-thru and car wash to be built on Route 6 here across from Taco Bell. It has been an open field, perhaps once a part of Larson’s Farm or neighbor to it?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> I’m reminiscing about the old Route 6 here, as well as Pine Street in Forestville. </p>

<p>Shout out to Sheila Roberts, the smiling young lady who works for Cousins Oil. She’s what you’d call a “peach of a gal!!”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Name game</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maple Avenue was known as Edgewood Street back in the late 1800’s. Gavin (Gauvin? - seen it spelled both ways) Greger, who is mentioned atop today’s column, likely was given his first name to honor his late grandmother, Agnes (Gavin) Greger. Also, was Gavin related to the late John Gavin, once the superintendent of Bristol’s Public Works Department? John was a good man, and I was proud to know him.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Boudreau</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came across Bob Boudreau on Thursday afternoon when I went to City True Value Hardware to purchase potting soil. I didn’t know it at the time, but Bob was a brand-new employee of the store. In fact, he upgraded my purchase to a larger bag of dirt while there. Son of a gun, a good salesman is this talented fellow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob and his sidekicks, known as “B.B.K." include Bob Alim and Kevin Prior, a trio who arrived in town about 18 years ago. They are known as community benefactors, and I believe Mr. Boudreau is their lead man. Joe Englert and Co. got a good one in Bob Boudreau.</p>

<p><strong>Donovan Court II</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a Donovan Court in Bristol, and it’s appropriately named after Joseph Donovan of Donovan Realtors, done so in the late 1940’s. I know I’m too early on this, but that would be nice to name a street after Donovan Clingan. The idea of a court is perfect, such as basketball court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Park Department project or housing development? How about a small-circled street with about six houses and a basketball hoop set up in front of each home? More ideas to follow!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
