<p>MIDDLETOWN – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team could not keep up with an aggressive Middletown squad on Tuesday, falling by a 66-48 final on the road in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons (8-2) reached the halfway point of the season while the Lancers (3-4) fell a game under .500 after previously winning three of their last four games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown’s Tyah Pettaway notched most of her game-high 26 points over the first and third quarters of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outstanding athlete dropped 11 points in the first frame and added ten in the third to keep Eastern at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shalyn Smith netted 14 points while Shadae Bushay scored 12 for the home team over a very balanced attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s All-Stater Ciara Collins collected her first ever 20-20 game and it was an impressive showing against an outstanding Middletown defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in 25 points, a career-high 21 rebounds and added five assists and five steals over one heck of an effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury&nbsp;also had a career day, looking more and more comfortable on the court by the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She canned 11 points, her career-high, while scooping up two assists and two steals – hitting 5-of-9 field goals overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent zipped up eight points – two of her hoops were three-point bombs – to go along with six rebounds and five assists, Janessa Gonzalez wrangled up four points, seven rebounds and rejected three shots while Lauren Ayotte contributed a half-dozen rebounds off the pine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Piendak, Madison Charette, Leah Roy and Gracie LaMar all saw action for the Lancers that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t all one-sided that night as Eastern made a game of it in the second stanza – chopping a double-figure first period deficit to nine points at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals stayed in it early in the third tilt but Middletown drained 10 of its first 16 field goals to etch up a 24-point cushion, never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons used its full-court pressing tactics to force miscues and turnovers early but two free throws by Gonzalez chopped the deficit to 8-2 midway through the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the home team ended the quarter with a 14-8 burst as Middletown led 22-10 through eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins and Drury each canned six points over a 19-point second period attack and at the half, Eastern was in it – trailing 38-29.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still a single-digit affair early in the third tilt but Eastern was outscored 24-9 and trailed 62-38 through three completed frames – falling by 18 in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the schedule holds, Eastern is slated to play Conard today at Bristol Eastern (6:45 p.m.) while the Lancers battle Bristol Central – from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium – on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in the first match-up between the programs this year.</p>
