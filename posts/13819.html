<p>EAST HAVEN - The Bristol Eastern softball squad is making fools out of the rankings in the CIAC Class L division bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are rated No. 21 in the fray but are hardly playing like a program that finished the regular season at 10-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe CCC softball is better than you think because after upsetting No. 12 Brookfield (5-2) and No. 5 Jonathan Law (5-4) over the first two rounds of state tournament play, did the Kingstreeters have anything left in the tank when the squad battled No. 4 East Haven in a quarterfinal round showdown on Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer was a resounding yes as Eastern defeated the Yellowjackets, 9-7, on the road - continuing in the big dance towards a possible state championship date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re dancing!” said Eastern coach Tyler Catlin via Twitter after the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that victory, the Lancers (13-10) will be playing over the final week of the scholastic season - drawing No. 1 Mask (23-1) in an epic semifinal showdown on either Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Epic is the word to use because through seven innings against East Haven, the game was tied at 7-7 and, once again, Alex Shorette smacked out the game-winning hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the eighth frame proved to be the dagger as Grace D’Amato (two doubles, two RBI) doubled while Emily Valentine was plunked by a pitch and quickly, ducks were on the pond for the ultra-talented Shorette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Shorette made the Yellowjackets pay as her single plated two RBI and in a wink of an eye, Eastern led it by two which ended up being the final difference in the encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alex Shorette played hero again with two RBI in the top of the eighth to give the Lancers a 9-7 lead,” said Catlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The East Haven program (23-3) was ranked fifth in the latest GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll as another top-ranked program bit the dust via the Lancers’ postseason burst.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Gracie Brown added a big hit along the way while Ali Tellier and Ashley Serafin cranked out home runs to make it a 4-0 contest through nearly three innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Yellowjackets were forced to play catch-up the entire afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier actually booted two homers and collected three RBI while giving East Haven all sorts of problems from the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She collected nine strikeouts but it was a total team effort that earned Eastern another postseason win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hailey Beebe made some clutch plays at second base in her varsity debut,” added Catlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, standing in the way of a Class L final berth is Masuk - one of the state’s top teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of the bracket, No. 7 Waterford advanced to the Class L semis with a 6-1 upset over No. 2 Ellington while No. 6 Avon - another member of the CCC - shutout No. 14 Fitch over a 3-0 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters are on the cusp of something very big and the last time Eastern was in this position came back during the 2010 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those Lancers went to the Class L title game but fell to Waterford, 3-2, from DeLuca Field in Stratford on June 12.</p>
