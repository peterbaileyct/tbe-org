<p>BRISTOL - The annual boys Bristol Middle School Cross Country championship, held this past Wednesday from the course at Page Park, was another competitive bout.</p>

<p>The outstanding eighth grader took the event in 13:06 - seizing the championship and establishing the course record in the process.</p>

<p>For West Bristol, Dean Stark (3rd, 13:37) was the top finisher of the winning program.</p>
