<p>BRISTOL - There’s always a loud cheer from the crowd at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium when Bristol Eastern super sophomore Zaveyn Tate is doing his thing, whether it’s snaring a tackle for loss in football or blocking an opponent’s shot in basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tate’s are a basketball family and a number of athletes from that clan have suited up for the Lancers on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Darieyn was an athletic guard for the program in the mid-2000’s followed by the IQ of younger brother Camryn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, after getting a little sampling of what Zaveyn could do on the court as a freshman last season, his role increased for his sophomore campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made his season debut last Thursday in the starting line-up, competing at the power forward/center position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against an overwhelmed Plainville squad, Tate was on the money over Eastern’s 54-24 blitzing of the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tate etched up seven points on 3-of-4 shooting from the field, nabbed three of his team-high 11 rebounds on the offensive glass, rejected three shots and had three steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all first varsity starts are supposed to go that way but Tate pushed all the right buttons over the thirty-point triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s ahead of his years,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray of Tate. “I sometimes have to remember that he is a sophomore and that’s his first varsity experience kind of getting out there. But I don’t treat him that way and he doesn’t want to be treated that way. That’s the good thing about him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He wants to be pushed and he wants to be the best he could be.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make no mistake about it, this guy is a varsity athlete, ready for the prime time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time Tate does something well on the court, a loud cheer erupts from the crowd as his family is into every loose ball he scoops up or shot he rejects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tate is strong and athletic and causes all sorts of mismatch problems on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s show a willingness to bang with anyone inside while shooting a couple shots from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His dribbling ability will help the Lancers get out of several possible jams this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a dual threat at that position,” said Ray. “He can put the ball on the floor. Sometimes he’s going a little fast but that’s just being youthful.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tate can also pass the ball with the best of them as his basketball IQ is backed up by his athleticism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect Tate to lead the squad in rebounding and blocked shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once his offensive game catches up to his defensive prowess, he will command attention from opponents as the season rolls along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He gives us some rebounding, he can pass,” said Ray. “He’s a problem out there for some teams.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scary thing is Tate could just be scratching the surface in terms of ability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bigger games are in store for the multi-talented sophomore and expect the cheers to grow louder as the season, and years, go on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The more we play to him and I’m trying to get him involved, the better we’re going to be,” said Ray.</p>
