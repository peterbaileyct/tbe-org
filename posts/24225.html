<h3>Speaking of Spring</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today is the first day of spring. Therefore, the mayor will be cutting a ribbon and having his picture taken because he created spring.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ha, ha, ha. He, he, he. Ho, ho, ho.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democrats were invited, but because they had seen their shadow since November, they will not be there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ha, ha, ha. He, he, he. Ho, ho, ho.</p>

<h3>Hark! Did someone say, Route 72</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was announced on this date in 1963 that it would be 12 years before Rt 72 came through Bristol. Due to a lack of funds and the time required for plans and acquisition of rights-of-way, the earliest that expansion could be expected was 1975. Uh-huh.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
