<p>An evening of side-splitting laughs is coming to the Rockwell Theater on Saturday with Downtown Live's third show of the season, "Funny Women of a Certain Age."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are excited to have these talented females come to our theater for an entertaining and hilarious evening,” BPRYCS Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said. “We invite everyone who hasn’t been to check out this amazing show at the Rockwell Theater.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Headlining "Funny Women of a Certain Age" is the show’s host and creator Carole Montgomery ("Comics Unleashed"), who has worked in stand-up comedy for more than 40 years, Jane Condon ("Last Comic Standing") and Leighann Lord ("Def Comedy Jam 25th Anniversary Special").</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery created the show to give older female comics a chance to be seen and heard. The many topics the performers bring their unique humor to include aging, parenting and navigating today’s technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought it would be a good fit because this comedy series was featured on Showtime and I wanted to bring something really great to Bristol,” Therriault said. “Jane actually lives in Connecticut, and Carole and Leighann are from NY originally, so it’s nice to have great local talent make their way to Bristol.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery had a vision of&nbsp;showcasing a rotating crew of older female comedians. In 2019, she joined some of the most respected names in comedy to film the Showtime special “Funny Women of a Certain Age.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The special was a huge success, becoming the highest-rated premiere standup show for the network that year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the heels of the show’s success, Showtime filmed two follow-up specials: “More Funny Women of a Certain Age” (2020) and “Even More Funny Women of a Certain Age” (2021). The show is currently touring the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's a comedy show with some brilliant women who will certainly make you laugh,” said Therriault. “Approximately 400 tickets have been sold.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Funny Women of a Certain Age" will be held Saturday, March 9, at 7 p.m. at the Rockwell Theater. The doors will open at 6 p.m., tickets are $40.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
