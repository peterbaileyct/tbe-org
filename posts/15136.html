<p>WATERFORD -- What more could be said about Bristol’s Senior American Legion baseball’s state tournament game against Waterford on Sunday afternoon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you force the top-seed into extra innings over a scoreless game, that’s getting the job done on the defense end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of offense, Post 2 was one Jayden Churchill theft of home plate away from snaring a huge Pod C victory over one of the best team’s in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People thought Bristol would be walked over last Sunday in Waterford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that assessment proved to be incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a well played game,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “I’m sure it was awesome to watch. [But] it was stressful to be in.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result, a 1-0 loss at the hands of Waterford, proved that the locals could hang with any team in the state when Bristol’s pitching and defense are in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Roberto Cruz lost for the first time this season, falling to 4-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you lose a game allowing just a solo run off six hits, that’s doing everything you can to help your team win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol had three or four possible hits snatched away against a very good infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford is unofficially ranked fourth in the last Connecticut 19U Team poll back on July 20, and while Bristol stumbled against West Hartford four times this past summer, the locals looked poised, focused and knew the task at hand over that second tournament game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, that’s been a staple of Bristol baseball in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the stakes are at their highest, Post 2 usually responds to the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It started on Saturday with a 6-0 shutout of Northeast and while Bristol fell at Waterford the following day, the postseason continues for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if Bristol gets by Enfield in an elimination game on Tuesday (6:30 p.m. from Muzzy Field), a trip back to Waterford is in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that first game against Waterford won’t be soon forgotten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a great game,” said LaPenta. “They shouldn’t be ashamed of anything. They played hard so it was good.”</p>

<h3>Pitching</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Woodsome looks to be a good possibility to start from the mound on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After making all those putouts in right field at Waterford, he was warming up and was ready to go if Cruz ran out of pitches that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His off-speed stuff will trick some batters, helping slow down an offensive Enfield program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Tuesday and Wednesday in Pod C</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford is a lock for the championship game in the pod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it will be up to Bristol to defeat Enfield on Tuesday to keep the postseason rolling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victor from Muzzy Field travels to Waterford on Wednesday for the final game -- or games -- in Pod C.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the visitor can pick off Waterford at the 5:30 p.m. attraction, an immediate rematch will take place and the winner moves on to the Super Regionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In simple terms, if Waterford wins the first contest on Wednesday, the program will advance in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning a game of chess would be easier at this point…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Zone 1 around the state</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top seed in postseason play, West Hartford of Pod A, lost on Sunday to Ellington (4-0) from Hall High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ellington moved on to the championship round while Post 96 will have to beat that squad twice if it can top the NCL/Windsor Locks team on Tuesday in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Pod D, Simsbury opened play with a 9-0 loss to RCP before rebounding against Tri-County - 6-2 on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 84 moved on to an elimination game on Tuesday in a rematch with RCP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Torrington is the surprise of Pod B as it picked off Danielson 6-5 in opening round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 38 fell to Middletown 12-2 on Sunday -- forcing Torrington into a loser’s bracket showdown against Tri-Town on Tuesday.</p>
