<p>BRISTOL - The girls city series track and field meet between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern went down to the wire on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads held the edge at the highly anticipated showdown with the Lancers leading by 13 points midway through things before completely losing that edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, in what turned into the most competitive bout between the programs in years, Eastern scored critical first and second place tallies late as the Lancers squared up a 76-74 victory over the Rams in a CCC South bout from the track and field at Bristol Central High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a great team effort,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “Those kids cheered each other on, they came together this season and they’ve just been getting better every week.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory came late for the Lancers in the 4x400 meter relay as the crew of Julia Armington, Princess Priscilla Dilone, Emily Piendak and Kaydence Meyer&nbsp;ended up winning the race in a time of 4:13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led wire to wire though in the final leg of the relay, Central’s Lynae Lewis closed the gap on Meyer over the final lap but finished just four seconds behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Those four kids won the meet in the end,” said Floyd of his 4x400 relay squad. “And they showed a lot of guts on that 4x400 meter relay and won it. They pushed it to another level which they finished through and helped us a lot.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Zephaniah Foote won the shot put with a toss of 26 feet, three inches while the Rams’ combination of Christina Brown, Rebecca Litwinczyk, Francesca Amara, and Emily Blanchette finished first in the 4x100 relay (52.3 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blanchette won the 100 hurdles (17.9 seconds) as Eastern’s Amanda Noel (18.0) was just a hair behind the winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kylee Barnes earned first place in the high jump with a make of five feet, two inches and when Lewis placed first in the 100 meters (13.1 seconds), beating out the times by Dilone (13.2) and Braccia (13.5), the home team was leading by four points (25-21).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Marjorie Moliengo earned the victory in the pole vault (seven feet, six inches), the Lancers’ twosome of Cecelia Gilbert (5:44) and Kaelyn Gonzalez (5:45) were 1-2 in the 1600 meters while in the discus, Foote’s heave of 77 feet, 11 inches won the athlete the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 400 meters was won by Lewis in 1:00.3 while teammate Nicole Riemer was tremendous in the 300 hurdles, seizing the win in a sterling 53.8 seconds.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the long jump, Barnes was at it again and her make of 17 feet, two inches was able to top teammate Lily Kirk’s great finish (second place, 15 feet, 10 3/4 inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the challenging 800 meters, Central’s Sophia Stark was the winner in 2:23, seven seconds in front of Gilbert (2:30), while Dilone was the winner in the 200 meters (27.4 seconds) as Eastern nabbed big points late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The sprinters have been consistent for us all season,” said Floyd. “They did a good job today.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern continued to perform well in the field which included a big showing in the javelin by Lauren Ayotte.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dominated the event, winning with a successful make of 91 feet even.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ayotte won the javelin,” said Floyd. “Foote won the shot put and discus and that was the key. Those kids did a great job for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte and company also won the 4x800 relay with Gilbert, Gonzalez, and Piendak taking the race in 10:53.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters went 1-2 in the challenging 3200 meters as the combo of Gonzalez (13:02) and Gilbert (13:31) dominated the race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central was able to topple all the competition in the triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central trio of Barnes (32 feet, 10.5 inches), Christina Browne (31-7.25) and Lewis (30-11) earned the squad the sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it was a huge victory for the Lancers on the road with its two-point triumph from BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think it was a great team effort by everybody,” said Floyd of the winning effort.</p>
