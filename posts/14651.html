<p>The Top-10 poll for the 19U of Connecticut American Legion Baseball was recently released for the week ending July 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one member of Zone 1 made a big jump up the rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of the ten teams ranked, nine programs were in the previous poll while North Haven from Zone 2 reappeared in the top-10 rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RCP was number one last week but got booted as two new challengers took the top two spots in the standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown, at a sterling 14-1, is the new number one team in the Top-10 while Zone 1 leader West Hartford (11-0) jumped from fifth place to second - making a strong case for the No. 1 spot in the next poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford is comfortably in front of Bristol (5-4) for the lead in Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol could tie for the zone lead if West Hartford was to suddenly go on a season-ending losing streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a bit of a shake-up, RCP (13-2) dropped to number three in the newest poll</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 30, Middletown spun RCP by a 5-4 push and then on July 1, in a huge showdown from Palmer Field, Post 75 was a winner again - sinking RCP 7-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Southern Division of Zone 3, RCP trails Middletown for the league lead by a half game going into Monday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greenwich (11-2) jumped from seventh to fourth while Willimantic (14-3) moved to fifth place after being eighth the previous week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But four of the five programs in the bottom-half of the poll dropped a couple positions while North Haven hopped back into the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Haven (11-3) fell from fourth place to sixth, Stamford (12-4) dropped to seventh - after being third to end June - while Waterford (13-3) came in eighth, falling from the sixth position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 9 North Haven (7-2) is new to the poll this week while Danbury (9-5) dropped one position from ninth to tenth to complete the rankings.</p>
