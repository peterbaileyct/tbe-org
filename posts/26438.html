<p>BRISTOL – It’s time for the city series rematch in scholastic softball as Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern lock horns one more time in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs are coming in with a little momentum since last competing at Page Park back on May 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is 18-1 overall while Eastern is a very good 11-8 as the squads compete for the final time over regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a ton riding on the line today as the Rams look to maintain their top state tournament ranking while the Lancers will also be in the playoff mix this season, win or lose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the two Bristol programs coming into the clash as Central and Eastern lock horns:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Game: </strong>Bristol Eastern (11-8) at Bristol Central (18-1)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>The contest is set for 4:15 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Bristol Central High School softball field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s on the line: </strong>Eastern is looking to improve its playoff positioning with a win while Central is nearly a lock for the second seed in the Class L field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coaches: </strong>Eastern’s Tyler Caitlin (second season) has his squad battle tested and ready to roll against the Rams. On the flip side, Monica Hayes has built herself quite an impressive program since taking charge in 2015. The Rams have always been a solid state tournament contender but the coach has the squad on the cusp of something much bigger over the past two years.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A quick look at…Bristol Eastern</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have gotten to the pay window several times over the second half of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 11-8 ledger is an excellent one by Catlin and his crew, playing very well from the softball field over on King Street this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio of seniors for the squad, shortstop Jazmyn Browne, catcher Sarah Lacouture and pitcher Ashley Serafin, have been an excellent assortment of leaders for the program and 11 wins in the always competitive Central Connecticut Conference is a tremendous accomplishment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this program will also rely on Kayla and Leah Webber, Emily Valentine, Makayla Antunes, Hailey Beebe, and Gracie Lamar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe the pitching trio of Brooklynn Whitlock, Bella Arborio and Beebe even gets a chance to throw in the circle. Who knows?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Streak</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has beaten some very good teams as of late, scoring huge triumphs against Plainville (11-8) and Tolland (6-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since losing three in a row midseason, the Lancers have seized victory in six of seven games, coming into the Central tilt with a two-game surge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-3 start, Eastern is 10-5 and remains the squad no one really want to play because of its ability to grind out a win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>State Tournament status</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will be in a very familiar place, hovering around the 20<sup>th</sup> seed in terms of the Class L tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And we all remember what happened last season when the Lancers were rated around that seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No. 21 ranked program went all the way to the semifinals to give top ranked Masuk a bit of a scare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anything is possible for this program if it can play error free ball and with the likes of the law offices of Browne &amp; Browne – making play after play in the infield – this squad has elite defense around the horn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, in terms of legal fees, Browne &amp; Browne only collect if your team wins!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Game</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers nabbed a huge 12-7 victory against Conard on Wednesday, getting a little momentum for the showdown versus Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lacouture dropped in two hits and three RBI, Jaz Browne added two hits, Lamar picked up an RBI tally, and Beebe smacked out a home run to pace the offense against the Red Wolves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beebe and Whitlock saw time on the hill for Eastern as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect today from BE…</strong>What is there to lose?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, Eastern can play a bit more at ease because this is a contest that Central should be a monster favorite to win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who is the pressure on here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Lancers team has been full of surprises lately, playing for each other and the team, and that’s a great position to be in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would it be any kind of real surprise if Eastern rolls out to an early lead?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the challenge will be stern against one of the top pitchers in all the state, dishing from the circle today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is looking to make some noise today on the opposite side of the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A quick look at…Bristol Central</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will look a little different at certain positions in the rematch against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The details aren’t important because this squad simply hasn’t skipped a beat in terms of wins and losses along with off the page chemistry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The changes in batting order and in the defensive lineup will be tested today but this Central program, led by the senior core of Sophia Torreso, Lorelei Stancavage, Kaley Laird, and Adrianna Lubrico, will keep a couple nervous youngsters poised throughout the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team is 19-1 for a reason and remains a favorite when Class L tournament action starts to heat up in June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Streak</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has won six straight games since dropping that tough 3-0 decision to top-ranked Southington back on May 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad has been playing defense at an elite level and over that six game stretch, the Rams allowed less than a run per game (0.9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of offense, the magic scoring number has been four to five runs scored by Central recently and with that stellar defense, that’s been enough to continue knocking off opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>State Tournament status</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless North Haven falls apart at Lyman Hall today, that squad should be the No. 1 seed in the Class L field with Central following in second place with the lone loss to Southington – assuming the Rams beat the Lancers this afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masuk just lost to Newtown on Wednesday (8-2) while Jonathan Law also hangs around in third and fourth place, respectively at 17-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Game</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams snuck out a 4-3 decision over a tremendous Windsor team (16-3) on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big time bout and a huge victory by the locals and all the stars came out to shine over a bit of a close call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird led the offense with a two-RBI triple and a run scored and then in the circle, Torreso was at it again; dishing, wheeling and dealing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso collected 13 Ks as she won another showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect today from BC…</strong>probably a lot of energy from Laird (drop the probably portion of that sentence) and the entire group which will included a couple young players getting their first starting assignments in a BC/BE varsity showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The veterans on this squad (Torreso, Stancavage, Laird, Lubrico) will help the team stay focused over the final game of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even those underclassmen like Mya Porrini, Sierra Messier, Tori Hogan, Emma Kulak, Dez Nickerson and Lillian VanNostrand have been ready for every challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 19-1 record to end the regular season is the goal and Central will look to end it early against Eastern with Torreso dealing in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s undefeated and looks to end her final regular season game in style with another triumph from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running mate Stancavage will be helping her behind the dish to close the contest out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CCC Tournament positioning is also on the line and a win by the home team keeps Central as a top seed when tournament play commences on May 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget it’s Central ‘Senior Day’ and that emotion could spill over in the game quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the ability to sweep the Lancers once again this season with a win at home in what could be a very good game…at least early.</p>
