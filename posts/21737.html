<p>ROCKY HILL –&nbsp;Winning a bit on the ugly side is better than the alternative of not generating a win at all.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s the scenario the boys basketball squad over at Bristol Eastern faced at Rocky Hill on Monday night, taking the Terriers best shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers nabbed the lead for good with 3:46 remaining in the first quarter and Rocky Hill – though still pesky – had to play catch-up the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got the job, earning a trip to the pay window in the process with its 58-39 triumph on the road in a CCC Interdivisional bout, winning its fifth straight game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers (6-1) truly had to fend off the Terriers (1-6) despite the home team trailing for most of the showdown. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our execution tonight in the first half was non-existent. There was too much one-on-one,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “I think they thought they could go to the basket whenever they wanted. I told them they had to be careful. [Rocky Hill] was a hungry team playing on their home court.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They had one win and was looking for their second against us. We were kind of playing into their hands.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zaveyn Tate (game-high 18 points, three rebounds, three assists) notched 11 of his team-leading total over Eastern’s 13-0 fourth period run and what was just an eight point spread became a 52-31 deficit with 3:10 left in regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tate finished at the hoop with zest, draining 8-of-11 field goals, and simply overwhelmed the opposition with his outstanding execution in the paint. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First half, [he] was non-existent. Second half, [he was the] MVP,” said Ray of Tate. “But that’s when we made a concerted effort to get the ball in there. We were trying to get him touches early and he was kind of being passive with the ball. I told him he had to score a little bit more. He took only two shots in the first half. He’s got to touch the ball and he’s got to score or at least collapse the defense.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the second half, when they went to go change their match-ups, it was his time to shine.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest commenced as a see-saw battle and it took the Lancers nearly 3:30 minutes to post its first points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Sward (15 points) helped cue an 8-0 run as he notched six points over the jaunt with his steal and lay-up at the 3:07 mark of the first quarter making it an 8-3 game.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers never trailed again from that point on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lukas in a game like that, pretty much can create his own offense,” said Ray of Sward. “So if he’s going to score, he’s going to score. [Brayden] Dauphinais was off a little tonight, he wasn’t his normal self and did not knock down as many shots. He wasn’t getting to the rim so we have other options.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers led 13-9 through one period before some halfcourt pressure defense led to a little Eastern offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jordan Chisholm (eight points, two assists) sank home a 3 and when Nate Fries (five points, three rebounds, four assists) canned a free throw with 5:10 left before the half, it was a 17-9 game. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We put a little press on them but we’re not that kind of team,” said Ray. “We’re not going to live or die by that but it allowed us to get a little bit of a lead. And then we went basket-for-basket. As long as we limited the runs, it was fine.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D’Amato and Chisholm hit threes over the mid and tail-end of the second period and when the latter drained his with just seconds to play before the half, Eastern scooped up a 25-15 lead – the first double-figure edge by the visitors that evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern pushed the deficit out to 12 early in the third quarter off a put-back from Brayden Dauphinais (seven points, 10 rebounds) but the Terriers chopped the deficit to seven off an and-1 by Tyler Carlstrom as the Terriers were down just 34-27 with 2:41 to go in the stanza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dauphinais proceeded to hit a free throw with no time left on the clock in the third tilt as Eastern was holding a 38-29 edge going into the final quarter. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A flip shot by Rocky Hill’s Casey Robinson (10 points) with 7:20 to play in regulation chopped the deficit to 39-31 but with Naseem Walker causing havoc defensively with his quickness and the superior interior passing by the Lancers to get Tate several early looks, Rocky Hill was all of a sudden trailing by 21 off that 13-0 Eastern spurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Walker again was able to come in and contain their guards and do things he needed to do,” said Ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two free throws by Rocky Hill’s Yaz Aftab (10 points) trimmed the deficit to 17 with 1:59 left but it was too little, too late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the Eastern scoring, Sward chucked in two charity tosses, Chisholm found Tate for an easy lay-up and Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum (two points, three rebounds) flipped in one final hoop to propel the Kingstreeters to a 58-39 triumph with a huge showdown against Platt (Thursday, 6:45 p.m. at BEHS) on deck. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We walked into the locker room [after the game] not playing our best but I was still happy,” said Ray. “I can’t say I’d feel like that in year’s past but I’m going to let every win be enjoyable because I know what it’s like. [Rocky Hill] was a hungry team playing at home trying to get a win.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve been there. We just didn’t let them win.” &nbsp;</p>
