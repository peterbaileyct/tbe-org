<p>It’s time for the first installment of the Bristol Central/Bristol Eastern softball city series bout, taking place on Friday from the softball field at BCHS - weather permitting - at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern’s first-year coach is looking forward to the challenge and the rivalry that always seems to bring the best out of Bristol’s top players.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I’m] pumped,” said Eastern coach Tyler Catlin of the game. “I’ve been part of some rivalry games in my past. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a tale of two seasons for the Lancers in 2022, in terms of games played on King Street - Eastern’s home base - and the contests from the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are perfect (5-0) from home at the Thunderdome, scoring at least 11 runs in each of those five victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the road has been a bit tougher as the Lancers are 0-6 against the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Kingstreeters haven’t been playing ham-and-eggers either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of those losses, a 3-2 setback to Berlin to open the campaign and a 2-1 loss a Glastonbury on April 18, were close as close could be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And last Friday, Eastern lost at Newington by only two runs (7-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other losses were to Hall, Maloney, and Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Central/Eastern showdown is something completely different - throw out the record books, get ready for the grind, and anything can happen in city series play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just hope these girls bring the intensity and the energy,” said Catlin. “That’s all I’m asking for, just to leave it all out there. I’ve got six seniors out there. It’s their season. I’m trying to get them prepared the best I can, and I want them to leave it out there and don’t leave anything out there to regret.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That senior core, featuring Grace D’Amato, Sam Policki, Sarah Snedeker, Alex Shorette, and the excellent battery of Ali Tellier and Janessa Gonzalez, are ready for this challenge - attempting to nab their first road victory of the season in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other featured players from Eastern that will take the field on Friday includes junior standout Jazmyn Brown, junior Ashley Serafin, freshmen Emily Valentine and Grace Browne along with sophomore Makayla Antunes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Same but different</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Central has only played once since absorbing a tough 2-1 loss at home to Hall last Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams battled Windsor last night, picking up a huge 9-5 victory from the road, and have two studs in the circle that could go up against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So who will be throwing for Central on Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will it be the smooth throwing Sophia Torreso or will stud Alex Sciarretto get the nod?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both choices are no-brainers, have tallied a couple games of 10-plus Ks, and helped the Rams to a sterling 8-2 ledger this season with just two one-run losses on their docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a good team and, once again, that pitching duo is surrounded by tremendous defensive talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorelei Stancavage is the other part of that winning battery while Kaley Laird (shortstop), Mya Porrini (third base), and Adrianna Lubrico (second base) man the infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam and Leah Sklenka are standouts in the outfield as is senior Ryleigh Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Sarah Romano will also take a couple swings at the dish for the Rams as the squad is ready for the crosstown battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, Central’s win at Windsor gave the locals instant playoff qualification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would have made the BC/BE showdown even more interesting if Central was still stuck on seven victories, needing a win over the Lancers for a playoff berth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Same but different</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the things that will be different about the BC/BE game this season will be the new coach from Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catlin took over for longtime coach Scott Redman and assistant Nate Jandreau who saw their team get a win or two along the way against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman, Jandreau, and Hayes are peers, on and off the field, and watching the pros go to battle with their respective squads was always a treat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is always a sense of pride when competing against (or coaching with) homegrown talent,” said Hayes. “The fact that so many of our Central and Eastern coaches in general are products of Bristol allows a lot of us to have those fun and competitive experiences, while also helping to continue to grow the Bristol sports tradition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman was fiery from the third base coaches' box, sometimes wearing a ridiculous hat, and shorts, even Chuck Norris would not dare put on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hayes will miss watching ‘Redeye’ get red in the face over a blown call and Jandreau yelling from the bench but the Central mentor is looking forward to battling Catlin - starting with Friday’s confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Central/Eastern matchups always have an extra sense of motivation or interest as a coach when you play each other and it's against someone you've known forever,’ said Hayes. “Eastern lost a good tandem in Redman and Jandreau. Having said that, I look forward to battling a new staff and wish them well.”</p>
