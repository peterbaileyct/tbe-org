<p>WOODBURY – There weren’t many upsets in the first round of the CIAC Class L girls softball field on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is except for a certain program from Bristol that seemingly loves to cause havoc in the bracket, year in and year out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the No. 22 rated Lancers continued to be the team no one wants to play in the postseason, holding off No. 11 Nonnewaug by a 6-5 final from Woodbury.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the 12th win of the campaign for the Kingstreeters (12-9 overall) as the team made huge plays late to stave off elimination.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the decision hanging in the balance in the bottom of the seventh in a 6-5 game and two outs on the board, Class L All-Stater Emily Valentine threw out the tying runner at the plate to end the game in style.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big time play by the sophomore (Valentine will be competing in the first Annual Sophomore All-Star game in Storrs after the completion of the tournament), helping the Eastern squad move on into the second round.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before that game-saving effort, Eastern catcher Sarah Lacouture threw out a runner attempting to steal third base as the Lancers simply made big play after big play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Lacouture (2-for-3, double, RBI), Hailey Beebe (two RBI) and Jazmyn Browne all tallied big two-out hits for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kayla Webber, Makayla Antunes and Ashley Serafin all zipped up hits for the winning program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Madi Charette scored two runs while Gracie Browne added a steal to Eastern’s offensive effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin earned the victory for Eastern over another complete game effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She allowed just three earned runs, 10 hits, walked just two and fanned three to tally the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Chiefs’ Allysa Calabrese went 3-of-4 at the plate but the home team could not notch a final couple runs to topple the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This contest went back and forth from the start as the Class L rankings were immediately tossed out the window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonnewaug scored two runs in the first inning but Eastern responded with three in the top of the third to snare a 3-2 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was 3-3 through three, 4-4 after four before the visiting aggression notched single runs in both the fifth and sixth stanzas to snare a 6-4 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nonnewaug scored a late run in the sixth but just couldn’t get one more run across, thanks in part to excellent Eastern defense in the seventh, to fall by a single run in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will be back in action on Wednesday in second round competition against another highly ranked foe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers travel to Vernon to square off against No. 6 Rockville – the former high school of BE’s own John Stavens.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 4 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
