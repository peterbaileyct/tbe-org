<p>Free samples for the taking abound at this sweet spot, Famiglia Tedesco at the Bristol Bazaar. There are cheesecake samples, samples of <em>tres leches</em> and brittle, but there are no chocolate samples, and there may be a good reason for that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>La Famiglia Tedesco owner Jeff Tedesco said it takes 12 to 16 hours to make chocolate. He said he refined his own chocolate by using cocoa beans from Ecuador to create his chocolate bars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whatever we make, we use quality ingredients and time-honored methods to produce our products,” Tedesco said. “Almost everything is done from scratch.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tedesco, who works alongside head pastry chef Nayomi Figueroa Collazo, said all desserts from flan to fudge are done by hand which is the way they are supposed to be. He said they take inspiration for several recipes from "The Cake Bible" by Rose Levy Beranbaum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collazo said about the partners that they balance each other out in the business and teach one another things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We try to focus on quality over trying to mass produce a lot,” Collazo said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tedesco said he wanted to start his own business after he retired. About three years later, a spin off called Jeff’s Kitchen at Rose Hill was formed. Located in Waterbury, the spin off features Tedesco’s handcrafted confections and Collazo’s baked specialties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collazo said Jeff’s Kitchen at Rose Hill also does catering so that occupies their time and requires teamwork, cooking and baking side-by-side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen,” Collazo said. “That’s how I started. I got more into cooking than baking.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said now she loves cooking as more of a hobby after she fell in love with baking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>La Famiglia Tedesco at the Bristol Bazaar, an indoor makers' market, is one of many artisan shops with their wares for sale. The Bazaar, which also houses Yellow King Bristol, a coffee cocktail lounge, is located on Race Street and is open Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
