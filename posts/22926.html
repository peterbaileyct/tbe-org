<p>Ernest Henry Bayer, Sr., 84, beloved husband of Patricia Ann (Duperry) Bayer passed peacefully into his eternal home on Tuesday, Dec. 7, 2022. Ernie was born on January 7, 1938, to the late John Bayer and Ottilie (Tiede) Bayer of Bristol. He was a graduate of Bristol High School. </p>

<p>Ernie met and married the love of his life, Patricia Ann Duperry on Oct. 24, 1959, and they enjoyed 63 years of love and adventure together. He was a kind, gentle and loving father to his four children: Jeffrey Bayer, Ernest Bayer, Jr, Kevin Bayer, and Wendy Bayer Dillon. He was also an amazing grandfather to Emily Mae Bayer, Alexia Bayer, Nicholas Bayer, Patrick Dillon and Rebecca Dillon.  </p>

<p>Ernie spent most of his life in Bristol. However, he and Pat took their family on a great adventure to Durango, Colo., where they lived for four-and-a-half years (1974-78). Ernie loved Colorado, where he learned how to ski, ride horses, and enjoy the beauty of the mountains. Life circumstances brought Ernie and his family back to Connecticut in 1978, but they never lost their love for Colorado. </p>

<p>After Ernest Jr. and Wendy’s family moved to Steamboat Springs, Colo., Ernie and Pat decided to take another adventure. They sold their house and moved to Steamboat Springs in 2016 at the ages of 78 and 76! They lived independently for five-and-a-half years, then spent the last eight months at Casey’s Pond Senior Living Center in Steamboat Springs. It was a blessing that Ernie lived the last of his golden years in the Colorado beauty with some of his children and grandchildren. </p>

<p>Ernie will be remembered most for the love of his wife and family, his kind heart, his calm and peaceful presence, his sense of humor, his incredible work ethic, and his perseverance in times of hardship. He will be greatly missed, but we are confident that he is in a place of eternal peace and love.</p>

<p>Ernie is survived by his wife of 63 years, Patricia D. Bayer, his children and grandchildren (mentioned above), his sister Sharon (Bayer) Butler, his brother Paul Bayer, and many nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his brothers John Bayer and Robert Bayer, and his sisters Louise (Bayer) Swanson and Carol (Bayer) McCorriston.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
