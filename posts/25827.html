<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central baseball program is in the midst of one of its best seasons since 2013.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That year, Central went 19-0 before dropping its final regular season game to Simsbury (8-5), going 20-2 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, the Rams are 11-0 but the squad has a huge showdown against Bristol Eastern in a big city series showdown at 7 p.m. on Friday from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s just a small preview of the contest between the Rams and the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central has yet to taste defeat:&nbsp;</strong>Geez, where do you begin?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are on fire as of late, a perfect 11-0 to date with several more wins left to be had on its docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a nine inning showdown against Enfield on Thursday, the only real trouble the Rams have faced this season, what will the encore be for the program?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What pitcher gets that starting assignment from Central?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All depending on who Coach Bunty Ray threw against Enfield, and then in relief, the Lancers could see a number of arms take the hill on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will it be Franky Spirito IV, Nate Pirog, Aiden Lopez or even Oscar Kuzniar?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those chuckers are undefeated with ERA’s that couldn’t buy Bristol Central math teacher Dave Greenleaf a cup of watered down Sanka (Sanka: Enjoy your coffee and enjoy yourself. How did the advertisers of Sanka get away with that slogan back in the day?).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s bats could be silenced by any number of those throwers who have given up a combined nine runs. That’s right&nbsp;<em>nine&nbsp;</em>runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the plate catching for the pitching staff is the incomparable - and highly intelligent - Ryan Ring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And out of the first six of those runs scored against the Rams, only two were of the earned variety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s the bottom line here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is that pitching staff the likes of Craig Lejeune (25-3 all-time at Central, 1.19 ERA over 193.7 innings pitched) or Matt Blandino (10-0 as a senior, 135 Ks, nine walks, three earned runs, 0.27 ERA) from days gone by?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s probably an unfair comparison because those two players ended up Division I pitchers (Spirito will show that fight at UConn next year).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this pitching rotation is gritty and will fight, scratch and claw its way to the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, we all know about Central’s one-through-nine batting order could be tweaked at a moment’s notice by Ray, a master of the human game of chess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Centerfielder Joe Gratta has been a pleasant surprise at leadoff followed by Anthony Santilli, Kuzniar, and the big man - Spirito at clean-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add in Ring and then a mix-and-match combination of Aiden Lopez, Mike Allan, Mikey McMahon and Christian Stafford to an already explosive line-up towards the bottom of the order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into last week, the program was batting .331 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to say chuck the records out the window and get ready for an up and down affair between the Rams and Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central is the team to beat in the biggest contest for the program to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is Bristol Central going to make it 12 straight with CCC South triumph over Bristol Eastern?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come down to Muzzy Field to watch UCONN National Basketball Champion Donovan Clingan throw out the first pitch and then enjoy all the fireworks that the BC/BE baseball confrontation will provide.</p>
