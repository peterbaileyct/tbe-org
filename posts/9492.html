<p>The Bristol Central football team was a successful operation over the first six years of the 2000s against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But once Timmy Washington and the Hernandez boys (D.J. and Aaron) moved on to compete collegiately, the games on Thanksgiving started to swing in the favor of the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The turning point came on Thanksgiving 2006 when Central, at 8-1, needed to beat Eastern to qualify for state tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, the teams went to a 14-14 draw, the Rams did not make the playoffs and the Lancers started to enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday much more than in previous campaigns.</p>

<p>Let the reading commence…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2000 - Bristol Central, 39-0:</strong> Five touchdowns and 353 rushing yards by All-State talent Timmy Washington saw Central win easily over Eastern. The five Thanksgiving Day TD’s and 353 rushing yards were a holiday record. Central’s Ron Davis made a 64-yard punt return, another record on Thanksgiving, as the Rams’ dominated in all facets of the showdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2001 - Bristol Central, 36-12:</strong> Washington notched four touchdowns – going for 242 yards on 22 rushes – as the Rams won again. However, Central missed out on a playoff berth but came away with a share of the CCC South Championship. Eastern’s Brian Walker had 105 yards on 15 carries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2002 - Bristol Central, 38-0:</strong> Eastern doesn’t generate a point over the next three Thanksgiving Day games as D.J. Hernandez and Breyone Evans combined for 256 yards on 36 carries over another blowout victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2003 - Bristol Central, 20-0:</strong> D.J. Hernandez was back at it as he rushed for 142 yards on 29 carries and two touchdowns in another shutout victory for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2004 - Bristol Central, 20-0:</strong> Central quarterback Cory Brown (10 passes, 107 yards) found Sean Ware (four catches, 78 yards) for several big connections while Steve Ziogas took in 126 yards on 18 carries for a third straight shutout over the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2005 - Bristol Central, 20-7:</strong> On a very cold evening, Aaron Hernandez had his finest Thanksgiving showing as he made seven catches for 112 yards and a touchdown as Central won over Eastern again. Quarterback Matt Coyne made 20 passes for the Rams while Dustin Tucker had 20 rushes for 102 yards.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2006 - Tie, 14-14:</strong> On a messy day with wind, snow, and rain – and Central needing a victory to qualify for the playoffs – Eastern held Aaron Hernandez in check as the teams drew a 14-14 stalemate and left the Rams hanging at 8-1-1 on the year – just out of the state tournament picture. The teams shared the bell, and it was the first time since 1998 that the Lancers enjoyed their Turkey Day effort. Eastern committed 10 fumbles in the showdown but still managed to keep pace with Central.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2007 - Bristol Eastern, 42-14: </strong>David Casanova racked up just under 200 total yards of offense as Eastern finished the regular season at 10-0 and easily picked off the Rams. The Lancers’ Chris Hazelton had six PATs while Casanova rushed for 181 yards on 14 carries. Eastern earned a Class M semifinal playoff berth, losing to Berlin by a 35-28 final from Muzzy Field. The Eastern squad was only the second public school team in Bristol history to finish undefeated during the regular season.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2008 - Bristol Eastern, 34-28:</strong> With Central threatening, Tyrell Holmes made a huge late game pickoff as the Lancers hung on to win the contest by six. Central’s Dymetric Maisonet added 118 yards on 21 rushes while Eastern’s Mike Zeigler went for 109 yards on 27 carries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2009 - Bristol Eastern, 46-13:</strong> Notching a series best 46 points against the Rams, Eastern easily downed Central as quarterback Mat Yopp zipped out 10-of-12 passes for 176 yards while Ray Ortiz had a career day (six catches, 127 yards) to lead the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
