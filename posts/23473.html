<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;There’s absolutely no doubting that Bristol Central senior Julius Powell would have made a huge difference on the fortunes for the boys basketball program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, an injury during the football season derailed any of those plans for Central and longtime head coach Tim Barrette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Division I play, would a 6-foot-8 giant have been of any help this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absolutely as Barrette was going use Powell in a twin towers approach with fellow senior Jayeson VanBeveren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Wouldn’t this been nice all year to have those two horses” playing together said Barrette of Powell and VanBeveneren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Powell was able to suit up against crosstown Bristol Eastern this past Monday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a pre-game arrangement, Powell was able to tally Central’s first hoop of the game, hitting a quick lay-up, in a fitting tribute to the squad’s fallen big man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that ceremonial basket led to something even bigger that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That hoop led to 17 straight points by Central as the team held off Eastern by a 59-52 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win helped Central break a nine-game losing streak after a decent 5-4 start to the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell and VanBeveren (12.9 points-per-game) would have been tough in Central’s high-low offensive schemes and defensively, there wouldn’t have been that many loose ball rebounds to collect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It changed a lot for us this year,” said Barrette of Powell’s injury. “Julius, single handily, was probably going to be a difference of four to six wins. You’re looking at a team that could have been 12-8 or 10-10 instead of 6-14.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams lost four games this season by five points or less, including a one-point setback at Berlin followed by a narrow 45-43 defeat to Conard in West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central lost to Xavier 52-49 but an aggressive center in the mix for the Rams - with Powell leading the charge - probably could have staved off defeat in just about all of those games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Powell would have been a factor in showdowns against Middletown, Farmington and rival Bristol Eastern the first time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that tough schedule was going to produce losses for the Rams no matter who took the floor for Central this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Showdowns against Windsor and East and Northwest Catholic would have challenged all the elite programs in the state of Connecticut and opposing coaches knew that very fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Central has one of the toughest schedules around,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what’s the bottom line for Powell?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last two seasons, Central is a perfect 27-0 when Powell takes the hardwood for the Rams - adding a state championship along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of his most memorable games, Powell had that huge stint against East Catholic last season during the Rams’ second regular season game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell notched eight huge points and kept Central afloat before starting center Donovan Clingan came back into the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won that showdown over the Eagles by a 74-59 final from Mohegan Sun Arena on December 21, 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were a perfect 28-0 last season and that’s a truly impressive legacy Powell is leaving the BCHS boys basketball team despite the injury setback this year.<br></p>
