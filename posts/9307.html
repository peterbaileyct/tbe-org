<p>PLAINVILLE – The Bristol Central football team battled Plainville in a primetime CCC Tier 3 showdown on Friday night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams were on a mission to keep their playoff hopes alive and by the completion of forty-eight minutes, it was clear that the Rams are ready for a postseason berth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind a slick defensive display, Central derailed Plainville by a 46-0 blitzing from Tinty Track and Field in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of the weekend, the Rams (8-1) were still fifth in the Class L rankings while the Blue Devils (6-3) were out of tournament qualification but slotted back to eighth by the completion of action on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turnovers, miscues, and a guy by the name of Victor Rosa was simply too much for Plainville to handle as the Rams led 28-0 at the half and forced running time late in the encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa, who had 2,071 yards coming into the game - as well as 33 rushing touchdowns - collected 245 yards, scoring three touchdowns, and then passed for 75 yards as the senior put on a huge show in the CCC showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He now has 2,316 rushing yards this year and that total is good for third overall in terms of single season yardage at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now he’s a half-dozen rushing touchdowns away from tying Central’s single season record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Central stopped an excellent Plainville offense with Anthony Paulino making a critical interception of a Michael Bakaysa pass as the visiting aggression did not allow the home team a single point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the Tolland victory, the Rams have been playing defense with inspiration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a combined 98 points against Hartford Public and Tolland, Central held Edwin O. Smith, RHAM and Plainville to 28 total points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a great way for the defense to go into its Thanksgiving Day war against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Plainville, Rosa scored the first three touchdowns of the evening off jaunts of four, four, and 37 yards to help the Rams scoop up a 20-0 push midway through the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damion Glasper ended the first half with a 59 yard sprint for a score and with just over two minutes remaining, Central’s edge grew to 28-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, Ashton Zabka caught a 31 yard pass from Rosa for a TD and when Justin Despins made a one-yard plunge into the end zone with 1:56 left in the third, it was a 40-0 romp as the game clock went to running time due to Central’s lead being over 35 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And late in the game, the Rams’ Nik Salinas barreled into the Plainville goal off a 63 yard touchdown rush and with 2:11 remaining, Central scooped up a 46-0 cushion to seal the deal.</p>
