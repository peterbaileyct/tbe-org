<p>I assure you, loyal and earnest readers of the Bristol Edition; as dry and boring as the next seven paragraphs will be, the resulting announcement will bring joy to every boy and girl (and all obese 70 year olds). It will answer a question that has haunted Bristolites since the late 1970's. <strong><em>So please keep on reading.</em></strong> Don't go back to your Wordle game.</p>

<p>The City of Bristol Zoning Board was about to review application #2422 on the agenda at their December 8th meeting. Application #2422  was a Site Plan for a fast food restaurant and drive-up facilities at 454 Farmington Avenue; Assessor’s Map 37, Lot 79; BG (General Business) zone. The applicant was Hashimi Management Corporation. This public hearing was actually continued from November 10, 2021.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attorney James Ziogas, 104 Bellevue Ave., representing the applicant, explained that at the November meeting most of the application was reviewed. The Commission approved the Special Permit for a fast-food restaurant with a drive thru window. At that time there were Site Plan Committee comments, and the applicant responded, but the City had not had the time to review the revised plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the comments were in regard to needed fencing around the restaurant's building and parking lots. The applicant's response seemed to satisfy all questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were other inquiries about long waiting lines at the drive-thru. James Ferro of the Hashimi, Management Corporation, explained that servicing customers was approximately 90 seconds at the drive thru window, and if there is a long vehicle line, employees would go out and take paper orders. Attorney Ziogas noted there was a 14-vehicle queue possible on the property.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the zoning commissioners noted that he had not received comments from the Water Department, but he speaks with them frequently, and if approved, the plan would be subject to remaining Staff comments. The Staff was satisfied with the plans. No one else spoke in favor of the application.<br>No one spoke against the application.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hearing was then closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a motion was made that Application #2422 – a Site Plan for fast food restaurant and drive-up facilities at 454 Farmington Ave.; Assessor’s Map 37, Lot 79; BG (General Business) zone be approved with stipulations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Now, here is the question that all Bristolites have wanted answered for the past 50 years. Why can't we have a Dairy Queen in Bristol?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, now we know the answer is, finally, yes. On Farmington Avenue, just above Kentucky Fried Chicken, three houses will be razed, and in that spot will rise A Dairy Queen. Yes, a Dairy Queen, the royalty of all soft ice cream establishments, the Holy Grail of ice cream lovers, the answer to an old man's prayer. </p>

<p>You may say I have gone insane. My answer to you is a question, have you ever had a Blizzard? Until you have, do not pass judgement.</p>
