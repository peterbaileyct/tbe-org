<p>BRISTOL - At 18-4, the Bristol Central softball team has competed against a very strong CCC slate of games during regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, it’s reward time as the Rams begin the Class LL fray as the fifth ranked squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means a couple home games could be in the cards if the locals can move on and keep advancing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central drew No. 28 Wilton in first round play this coming Tuesday at 4 p.m. in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do the Warriors deal with either of the two-headed monster on the squad of pitching sensations Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two juniors present problems, problems, and even more problems for opponents at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And things won’t change in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether it’s one of the Sklenka’s - Samantha or Leah in the outfield – or pesky Kaley Laird at shortstop bringing superior defense, Wilton is going to have its collective hands full on both sides of the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central advances, round two would bring another home showdown against either No. 12 Cheshire or No. 21 Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither one of the possible opponents played the Rams this season but Cheshire fell to Southington (14-1) back on March 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that note, half of Central’s losses were to Southington this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all the top seeds continue to qualify, Central could square off against No. 4 Glastonbury in quarterfinal round play on June 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Simsbury, Central has yet to tangle against Glastonbury – another strong CCC competitor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the Rams, the top five teams in the Class LL bracket includes Danbury (No. 1 seed, 19-1 overall), Southington (No. 2, 19-1) and Fairfield Ludlowe (No. 3, 19-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three of those programs are championship worthy but Central belongs right in that conversation as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how the Class LL breaks out in 2022:</p>
