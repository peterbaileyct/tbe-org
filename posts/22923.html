<h2>The City of Bristol Water Department made the following announcement this week: </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the warmer temperatures this year, we have elected to begin our annual hydrant flushing program, earlier than normal. Unfortunately, due to last year's drought conditions we were unable to complete the entire city, so we do anticipate an increased water decolorization as we flush. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We greatly appreciate everyone's patience as we get through this program and will post daily the areas which will be flushed. Please be advised that areas may change day to day. To stay up to date with all notices please sign up for Notify Me on our new website. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Information on the flushing program will also be posted on the Bristol Water Department Facebook page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday's schedule will be on the following streets:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Karen Road, Moody Street, King Street, Carpenter Avenue, Jennifer Road, Morris Avenue, Concetta Lane, Regency Court, Lynn Road, Vantana Road, Spark Avenue, Bristol Eastern High School, Stonecrest Drive, Castle Road, Madison Drive, Gayle Drive, Topview Terrace, Garfield Road, Cobble Hill Drive, West Washington Street, <a></a>Posa Drive, Artisan Street, Root Avenue, and Brook Street, and the surrounding areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will flush hydrants on these streets and the adjacent areas through Thursday, February 16, 2023, starting at 8:30 a.m. and ending at 4:00 p.m. Low pressure and discolored water is to be expected during flushing and for short periods afterwards. We recommend you refrain from washing clothes during this period. You should run an outside faucet or the cold water in your bathtub until the water runs clear.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
