<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In its most recent email newsletter, Thomaston Savings Bank issues an alert regarding back-to-school related scams. In particular, the newsletter names student tax scams, scholarship scams and student loan forgiveness scams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Don't be fooled, there is no such thing as a student tax," the newsletter states. These scams come by email, text or phone, with the person on the initiating end claiming to be with the IRS, which never makes an initial contact through any of these.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scholarship scams may arrive via an email or text claiming that a student has won a scholarship and now need to pay an application fee. "Remember, there are no legitimate scholarship providers that will require you to pay a fee."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Erasing student loan debt for an offer that should set off an alarm. These arrive through an email or text and are directed to students or their parents. "Once the victim has sent over funds, the student loan debt remains. Remember to never work with a private company to reduce or eliminate student loan debt. Legitimate companies do not charge fees for their service."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
