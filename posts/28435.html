<p>SIMSBURY - The Bristol American Legion Senior baseball program is starting to roll just at just the right time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a tough start, a few postponements and a backlog of games to be played, Post 2 is putting everything together over its playoff push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winning continued into Tuesday when Bristol knocked off Simsbury by a 3-1 final from Memorial Field in Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory evened the season series between the squads at 1-1, avenging a 10-1 loss to Simsbury back on June 11 from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Bristol attacked from the start, scoring single runs over the second, third and seventh frames to take a huge two run win – earning the program’s ninth victory of the campaign.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a good baseball game, well played,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 improved to 9-7-3 overall, slotting into third place of the Zone 3 American division standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss pushed Simsbury, now at .500, into a bit of a backlog towards the bottom of the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 84 fell to 9-9 overall and is in a fourth place tie with South Windsor and Tri-County.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast is currently 8-9-1, at the bottom of the standings with two games against Bristol remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s certainly going to be an entertaining ride to the regular season finish line between Bristol and all those squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pitching wins games</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Post 2 has allowed just three runs over its past two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s off the power of a surprise start by Jayden Churchill at Ridgefield (complete game, four hits, 74 pitches, 1-0 overall record) along with a tremendous four innings by Declan Schenck (64 pitches, 1-1) while Ryan Maglio (4-1) threw a three-inning, one hit, 34 pitch save against Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are huge performances which has helped keep Bristol from taxing its depleted roster too much as the locals are rolling into a possible postseason berth with a little zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The whole goal has been to play our best baseball at the end of the year,” said LaPenta. “We’ve now won four out of our last five.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s more to come over a full slate of road games this week with only one day off (Thursday) on tap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Molinsky good to go on Wednesday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Bristol travels to Torrington for a continuation game from Fuessenich Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington leads by two runs (3-1) through three-and-a-half innings with batters five through seven due up in the bottom of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schenck started the contest on the mound in that late June game and was hanging in until the skies opened up – postponing the contest due to saturated field conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when the game recommences on Tuesday, Caleb Molinsky (3-1 overall), coming back from a bit of a knee injury, will take the mound, hoping to keep Torrington off the boards while Bristol plays catch-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s going to start [Wednesday] in the suspended game,” said LaPenta of Molinsky. “He won’t have to throw a ton of pitches either way so that will be perfect.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just like Molinsky did in Bristol’s 3-2 win over Middletown on July 5, it’s a chance for the chucker to get Schenck off the hook for the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, this is a game Post 2 can turn and with Torrington (6-13-1) struggling a bit, now is the time to pick the squad off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have three innings to score two runs and we’ll get another win,” said LaPenta. “We then get a day off and have to go up to Enfield and Tolland.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[But] it will be a nice ride home tonight [from Simsbury] anyways.”</p>
