<p>At the NAACP scholarship breakfast on Monday, local chapter president Tim Camerl invited the former local chapter president Lexie Mangum to join him on the podium to make a special request.</p>

<p>"Since COVID came, the choir stopped," Mangum said about the organization's youth choir. "We want to get that back."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"But first of all," he said, "we are looking for people that can leave the attitude at the door," a comment which drew laughter and applause from the crowd of 150 people.</p>

<p>The scholarship breakfast officially named the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rev. Dr. E.C. Whitehead Scholarship Breakfast, is held annually on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday at Bristol Eastern High School. It is sponsored by the Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP.</p>

<p>This year's speaker, 2019 Conn. Teacher of the Year and retired performing arts teacher Sheena Graham, addressed "Preparing Minds for Future," which included Graham singing an original song at the conclusion of her talk.</p>

<p>"Now I didn't say anything about a black choir," Mangum said. "I said a choir. All right, we are looking for people, don't worry about how good your voice is."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members of the youth choir are from 5- to 14-years-old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If you can leave your attitude at the door and come in with a positive disposition about you and willing to learn to sing and wanting to sing, we are looking for you," he said. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
