<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern football program has some big plans for the 2023 campaign and if the squad can remain healthy, the Lancers are going to cause a little havoc on the gridiron in the coming months. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters are looking to improve upon their 3-7 ledger (2-5 CCC Tier 3 games) from 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of class size, Eastern remains in Class MM and a member of the Central Connecticut Conference, Tier 3 division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, some expected players will return to the fold at Eastern while a few others have transferred out and will be playing elsewhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, don’t sleep on Eastern this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are in the same boat in terms of their 10-pack of games as last season with one non-conference opponent to tackle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the second year in a row, the Lancers will hit the road for their CT Connecticut Alliance Football challenge – needing a little extra gas money to get to that exotic destination.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike last season, Eastern will get plenty of time on its home field in September, squaring off against opponents on Thursday, Friday and Saturday showdowns this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of Eastern’s home games take place from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School, commencing at 6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Weeks 1 and 2 will feature games from Bristol as the locals debut against Farmington on September 9 and exactly one week later, Hartford Public comes to town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s 2023 CT Alliance Football game commences at Hillhouse High School in New Haven on September 22 (6 p.m.). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Academics finished last season at 3-7 overall, losing its crossover game at Middletown by a 34-6 final on September 23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers end the month with a showdown against always competitive South Windsor from home (Friday, September 29).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern plays three times in October, starting with a quick trip to Rocky Hill High School on Thursday, October 5 (6:30 p.m.) before the bye week (October 12) gives the program a midseason break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 20, Eastern hosts Platt of Meriden in a CCC challenge and then the Lancers hit the road eight days later on Saturday, October 28 for a trip to RHAM in Hebron (the lights have not been installed on its football field yet?).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since the CCC schedule maker hadn’t already spent all of Eastern’s fuel budget to that point of the season, a trip to Edwin O. Smith is in order on Friday, November 3 at 6 p.m. – using any remaining drops of gas that program cobbled together for the 2023 school year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have their final ‘home’ game of the season on Friday, November 10 – hosting Avon in another CCC clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, on November 23, Eastern and Central commence on-field warfare in what should be another memorable clash between the rival programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is looking for a little Thanksgiving Day payback as the program fell to the Rams 13-6 last year over another nip-and-tuck affair. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has won seven straight games against Eastern on Turkey Day. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters last won on Thanksgiving back in 2014 over a 20-18 triumph but have been looking to get back to the pay window against the Rams ever since.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
