<p>SIMSBURY - The Bristol Junior American Legion Baseball squad put its undefeated ledger on the line this past Sunday when it traveled to Simsbury for a Zone 3 showdown from Memorial Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, it was Post 2 seizing a huge win on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the power of a dozen base-on-balls, Bristol blasted out a 9-1 victory – moving to 4-0-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury fell to 1-3 and only scored in the final inning of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 took advantage of all those walks, as well as a little timely hitting, to remain undefeated this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steven Lodge, Caleb Simard, Caleb Molinsky, Jon Montgomery and Mason Harris all tallied hits for the Bristol squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of walks, Gavin Colvin had two, as did Brayden Schenck and Tate Stevens, while Brian Grabowski earned a total of three free passes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grabowski also netted a couple runs while Gabe White and Harris collected two RBI apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol threw a trio of pitchers out on the mound, none going above 35 pitches, to secure the victory and maintain maximum pitching availability over the ensuing games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery did not allow a run in his three innings of action while Grabowski (one inning) and Jack Ericksen (three innings) both mopped up to lead the Bristol program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 rolled out three runs in the top of the first frame and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol added two runs in the second stanza and another two in the third to make it a 7-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Single runs pushed across the plate in the sixth and seventh frames helped Post 2 pile up that 9-0 cushion as the bottom of the seventh commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury notched a run late in the fray but never threatened even after scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Post 2 zipped up a tremendous 9-1 final to remain undefeated on the campaign in 17U play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Game that will <em>never </em>end</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol still has a game to complete as the squad is deadlocked in an 8-8 tie against Tri-County.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was scheduled to finish that marathon of a game on Monday night after the Senior squad battled Northeast but the rain had a different plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new date of the makeup is currently TBD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming Contests</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol plays two of its next three games from home as Riley Field is going to see some more Junior Legion action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, Enfield comes to Bristol (5:45 p.m.) and then on Thursday, Post 2 travels to square off against undefeated RCP (5:45 p.m.) at Xavier High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally on Saturday, its Torrington’s turn to travel to the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 1 p.m.</p>
