<p>A stat’s check is in order for the Bristol Blues of the New England Collegiate Baseball League.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program, a sterling 25-9, are getting it done from both sides of the plate and aren’t that far off the best record in the league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the numbers for the squad as of Friday: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pitching&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colin McVeigh (3-0 overall) leads the squad in ERA as his 0.68 has seen the chucker allowed just two runs over 26.1 innings pitched.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jagger Duquette is second in ERA (1.55) as the former Bristol Eastern standout has thrown 29 innings of 10-run ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s fanned 25 batters while walking only four batters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paoli, Mason Ulsh, Luke Garofalo (five saves), and Matt Smith are a combined 9-0 as the Blues’ pitching staff has been on the money from the get-go.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peter Phillips (two saves) has closed a game or to for Bristol this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Offensive numbers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the plate, Chaz Myers was leading the Blues in batting average (.350), home runs (three), and second on the squad in RBI with 15.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derek Tenney (16) was Bristol’s RBI leader entering the squad’s double feature on Saturday in Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Smith is hitting .333 on the campaign, Jay Harry was just a little behind at .319 while Tenney was batting a cool .306 this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two on Saturday</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues had a back-to-back confrontation at North Adams on Saturday as one of the two games was a make-up from a rain-out earlier in July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol won the first contest, snaring a 4-3 victory in eight innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues broke a 1-1 tie in the eighth with three runs to snare the eventual win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Denney tallied three of Bristol’s seven hits - going 3-of-4 overall with a double, a run scored and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Kelley won the game for Bristol in his one inning of relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the immediate rematch, the Blues were no-hit over a 4-0 loss to drop the locals to 25-9 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ulsh was sensational over his five innings, allowing just two hits and fanning two but did not factor into the decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Back home&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Mystic Schooners pay a visit to Bristol on Thursday and to close out the week on Saturday, the Upper Valley Nighthawks invade the Mum City.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games from Muzzy Field start at 6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
