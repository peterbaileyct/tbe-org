<p>The Bristol Edition is now (four years old), and in that time we have been dedicated to give the people of Bristol accurate, timely and thorough reporting about our city.</p>

<p>With election season in full swing, we would like TBE to be available to as many readers as possible. For that reason, and many others, we have decided to remove our paywall, and make our newspaper available to all who wish to read it. There will no longer be a need to log-on to read TBE; all that will be necessary is to click on a story and you will able to see it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing is more painful for the writers and editors of TBE than to hear than when someone says, “I’ve never heard of your paper.” Ouch!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That does not mean we don’t need financial support, because we certainly are in need of funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are hopeful that free access for all will help remedy that issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We encourage all who have been faithful subscribers to continue making your monthly commitment. The only difference will be that it will become a donation instead of a subscription. We cannot exist without financial support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will also be looking for grants and donations from local and national organizations to increase our budget and enable us to hire and pay reporters for local beats.</p>
