<p>WEST HARTFORD – The Bristol boys swimming and diving co-op, combining all three of the high schools in town once again, was able to start its 2022 campaign in style – sinking Hall of West Hartford by a 94-86 final from the Cornerstone Aquatics Center Pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol contingent won seven events, taking both the 200 medley and 400 freestyle relay events over the eight-point victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>200 medley relay, the foursome of Nathan Stellmach, Davis Kroll, Mikel Palaj, and Aidan Collins won the race in 1:43.20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 400 free relay, Bristol’s collection of Stellmach, Kroll, Palaj and Collins were the winners in 3:30.54.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 200 freestyle event saw Bristol’s Noah Taylor finish in 2:00.70, good for first place, while Stellmach earned the nod in the 50 free with a time of 22.78 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Stellmach wasn’t finished as he won the 100 free in 50.08 seconds while Palaj got to the pay window in the 100 butterfly (52.07 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Collins was the victor in the 100 breaststroke, capturing the event in 1:11.28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is back in action next Tuesday as the squad makes its hometown debut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 11, Bristol battles Avon in CCC action from the pool at the Dennis Malone Aquatic Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m. and is the only home event schedule for the month of January in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Senior transfer already paying off in the pool for Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stellmach transferred into St. Paul Catholic for his senior year this past fall and is a tremendous athlete in the water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 50-yard freestyle (22.32 seconds) and 100 breaststroke (58.45 seconds) at the 2021 boys Naugatuck Valley League championships last season and now will be helping the Bristol grouping going forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a standout in multiple events including the 50 freestyle, 100 freestyle, 200 breaststroke and 200 IM.</p>
