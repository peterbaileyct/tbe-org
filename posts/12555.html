<p>The pastor, Rev. Theodore Beusel, was a respected and popular leader of a Lutheran parish in town. What could he have done that led to his being charged with sedition? Storm the Capital in D.C.? Take part in an assassination plot? Nothing that sinister. He actually will be charged based on a dinner conversation with ”friends.”<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is an incredible story in which Reverend Beussel will be found guilty on three counts of sedition and sentenced to 30 years in prison. As a result, he will be removed from the church, lose his home, and his US citizenship will be revoked.<br><br>What did Reverend Theodore Beussel say in a room with only three other people, resulting in his American dream being destroyed?<strong> </strong><br></p>
