<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wheeler receives $2 million federal grant to address mental health treatment following incarceration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler Adult Reentry Program is the only award recipient in New England of a five-year, $2-million federal grant aimed at helping individuals in central Connecticut after incarceration returning to their communities with behavioral health and substance use disorders, according to a release from Wheeler Family Health and Wellness Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 19, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through its Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), announced 34 awards totaling up to $13.6 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wheeler Adult Reentry Program will improve both access to health care and treatment outcomes, as well as ease community reintegration through culturally appropriate intensive care management, trauma-informed treatment, and linkages to whole-person health services at Wheeler’s community health centers, the release states. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Services will include primary care, medication for substance use disorder, mental health, dental, nurse care management, peer engagement, and more. Wheeler will collaborate closely with corrections, parole, probation, and other agencies to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with improved health outcomes, Wheeler will focus on engaging individuals in recidivism-reducing community recovery supports/resources that promote education, empowerment, self-sufficiency, and skills to support prosocial behaviors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler's Health &amp; Wellness Centers in Hartford, Bristol, and New Britain are funded in part by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an operating division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial health insurance welcome. No patient will be denied health care services due to an individual’s inability to pay for services.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler Health has exceeded its original four-year fundraising campaign goal for its new Bristol health center and administrative headquarters two years ahead of schedule and is extending its goal to celebrate and honor its 55th anniversary in 2023, according to its most recent digital newsletter.</p>

<p>Since the launch, Wheeler has received donations toward the campaign from approximately 400 individuals and organizations, ranging from under $1 to $50,000, from corporate employee giving campaigns to realized planned gifts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fundraising campaign announced in February 2022 was initiated with a pledge of $100,000 from the Barnes Group Foundation during a silent fundraising phase, as well as a $100,000 goal in gifts and pledges from Wheeler’s Board of Trustees, and $80,000 from Wheeler’s senior and executive leadership.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A supporting named brick campaign is on track to have at least 100 bricks in place when the facility opens in 2024. Bricks are available for purchase through the summer of 2023, an extension based on construction timelines for the center.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler’s 46,000-square foot community health center and administrative headquarters at One Hope Street will offer integrated primary and behavioral health care for all ages, treatment for substance use disorders and nutrition services. It is Wheeler’s first newly constructed facility since its original location in 1972.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
