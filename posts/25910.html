<p>Off the resounding 10-2 victory over Bristol Eastern on Monday evening, how did the Bristol Central softball team fare against Berlin – on the road – in a CCC South bout on Wednesday?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another shutout victory as Sophia Torreso absolutely shut down the Redcoats offense, helping Central post a 7-0 blanking of Berlin from Sage Park in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams moved to 12-0 off the victory while the Redcoats (7-5) lost for the second straight game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How untouchable was Torreso that afternoon?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She absolutely demolished the competition with 17 strikeouts while just allowing one hit overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was just an average day for the outstanding Torreso who already has a no-hitter and perfect game to her credit this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin had just as many errors as it had hits that afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso faced 23 batters that day and against one of the CCC’s most talented chuckers, 22 of those players were shut down from the dish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats batted just .045 against the All-State talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jessica Petit was the only hitter from Berlin that was able to tally a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso walked just one batter along the way while Central’s defense playing behind its pitching stud was flawless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Alex Sciarretto, Kaley Laird, and Sam and Leah Sklenka – all hovering at the top of Central’s batting order – all stood out offensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit also belonged to Lily Nostrand for her work at the dish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin pitcher Madeline Mota drew the loss, going the distance but just couldn’t slow down Central’s potent offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She allowed six earned runs, nine hits, just one walk while fanning nine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scored a single run in the first stanza, adding three more in the third and two more in the fourth to secure a 6-0 edge through four.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central tallied one final run in the seventh to take away a huge 7-0 shutout win on the road in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory set up an epic showdown between the Bristol Central and Southington softball programs - a combined 23-0 this season - in a CCC interdivisional showdown on Monday in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start time for the contest is 4:45 p.m. and is an event that simply can’t be missed.&nbsp;</p>
