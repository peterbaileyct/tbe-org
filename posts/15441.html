<p>The playoffs are upon the New England Collegiate Baseball League as the regular season was recently completed by the Bristol Blues on Saturday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the locals expect to be prime time players over postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues already clinched a first round bye in the playoffs while a victory against Danbury on Saturday would propel Bristol to the regular season title – and a number one seed in the postseason tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of the finish from Saturday, the Blues were slated to start the postseason from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>The week that was </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After starting the week with a tough 5-1 setback to Danbury on Tuesday, Bristol got right back to the pay window on Wednesday – drilling the Valley Blue Sox by a 5-2 final from McKenzie Stadium in front of 600 fans.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol notched two runs in both the second and third tilts to snare a 4-0 edge, never relinquishing the edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colin McVeigh chucked a solid 5.2 innings for Bristol, allowing just three hits and two earned runs while striking out four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luke Garofalo (1.1 innings, two hits) earned the save for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chaz Myers (run scored, stolen base) and Jack Lynch (two RBI) smoked out two hits apiece for the winners while Jay Harry smacked out his sixth double of the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacob Gaudreau had the other hit for the Blues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Thursday, July 28, Bristol had an immediate rematch against the Sox and the result was even worse for Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues wrangled up a 9-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Kelley (three strikeouts) threw four scoreless frames for Bristol but Tommy Hughes pitched a single inning in the fifth to salt away the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues out-hit the Sox 8-6 as Matt Smith and Luke Broadhurst each dropped in a pair of hits to pace the offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith went 2-of-4 with a walk while Broadhurst was also 2-of-4 but knocked in a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derek Tenney (1-for-2, BB, RBI) Carson Swank (1-for-1, two RBI) each added doubles while Griffin Arnone dropped in a home run as the Blues had won two straight games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was just a 1-0 game through four frames before Bristol unloaded for five fifth inning runs to turn a close contest into a blowout as 371 fans enjoyed the festivities from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the regular season finale from Bristol, the Blues had another one-run nailbiter as the North Adams SteepleCats traveled to the Mum City on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a close one throughout, but the Blues scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth to capture a 6-5 victory – moving to an outstanding 31-12 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 900 fans at Muzzy Field witnessed a great come from behind win as Bristol trailed 5-3 going into the fateful ninth and final frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the ninth, Joseph Rios doubled and when Ben Huber was plunked by a pitch, two runners were on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lynch ended up singling on but an error by the SteepleCats pitcher plated both Rios and Huber and quickly, the event was all tied up at 5-5 without the benefit of an out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Lynch on second base – representing the tying run – and one away, Swank was hit by a pitch and Lynch advanced to third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Smith was then intentionally walked to load the bases, putting the force on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Harry blasted a long fly ball to centerfield for the second out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the play, Lynch scored from third base as the sac fly propelled the Blues to the one-run win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry went 2-of-3 with a double and two RBI, Rios was 2-for-4 with an RBI, and Lynch had that critical single to pace the Bristol offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitcher of record for the Blues, Thomas Benincaso, threw in just the ninth inning – allowing two earned runs – but took the victory after the comeback bid by Bristol was successful. </p>
