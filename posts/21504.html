<p>Raised in Bristol, she graduated from Bristol Central High School and attended Lasell Junior College in Newton, Mass. After working as a medical secretary, she worked for many years in the office at Bristol Hospital. She was a member of St. Gregory the Great Church, Bristol. She loved playing her piano. She was a wonderful cook so she and Gerry loved entertaining and spending time with their many dear friends. They enjoyed sailing trips to the Caribbean with friends and family and spending time on Martha's Vineyard and winters at the Summerhouse in St. Augustine, Fla.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
