<p>It’s once again time to honor our scholastic athletes from Bristol and the entire state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CAS-CIAC honored and celebrated 350 statewide scholar-athletes this past Sunday at the 40th annual Scholar-Athlete Awards Banquet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The event was held at the Aqua Turf Club in Southington.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Scholar-Athlete Program annually recognizes two high school seniors from each member&nbsp;high school whose academic and athletic careers have been exemplary,&nbsp;whose personal standards and achievements are a model to others, and who&nbsp;possess high levels of integrity, self-discipline, and courage.&nbsp;</p>
