<p>The Bristol Eastern boys and girls cross country programs had a busy day of action from Page Park in Bristol last Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The girls outfit split the day against Lewis Mills and Berlin while the boys fell to both teams from the Johnie M. Floyd cross country course.</p>

<p>On the girls side, Berlin defeated Eastern 19-42 while performing well against Mills - posting a 15-50 victory.</p>

<p>In terms of the top 15 at the event, the only other Eastern runner to crack that group was veteran Lauren Ayotte who also ran extremely well up, down, and back up all the hills that the Johnie M. Floyd course provides.</p>
