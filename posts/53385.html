<p><em>Editor's note: Bristol does not have a synagogue, although it did until 2000 when Bristol's Beth Israel Synagogue closed. Many of its members joined Southington's Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregation (GSJC) which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.</em></p>

<p>The Torah, Judaism’s Holy scroll, starts with the words “in the beginning” and so we start this history of Southington’s only Jewish congregation the same way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the beginning, 1983, a Southington accountant, Hy Rosenstein, struck up a conversation with a fellow Jew, Mike Rodensky, while donating blood. There was no Jewish congregation nor community center in Southington, yet they knew that there were other Jews in the community and surrounding towns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A press release and word of mouth led to 100 people showing up for a meeting at St. Dominic’s Church.  Though there were differences of opinion, the positive energy quickly led to action. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services were held at Briarwood College and a Hebrew School was started at the YMCA with the first classes held on Sept. 9, 1984. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first filing of an official name with the then Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now known as the Union for Reform Judaism) was Greater Southington Jewish Congregation (GSJC) and thus, 40 years ago, the congregation began its formal affiliation as a Reform Jewish congregation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first year, lay members led services but the hiring of a rabbinical student for Rosh Hashanah led to having four more students lead services throughout the year before the congregation decided to hire an ordained rabbi. There have been ordained rabbis ever since including Rabbi Alana Wasserman who is the current rabbi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The congregation held services in many places until the First Congregational Church (FCC) of Southington offered GSJC a space for High Holiday services. This generous invitation led to a long-term connection between the congregations up until today. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This relationship has led to shared services and meals, swapping of clergy for sermons, putting on musicals together and so much more. In 1993, GSJC had its own sign added to the FCC sign in front of the Town Green. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A temple needs a Torah. The Torah is the scroll that contains the five books of Moses (the first five books of what Christians call the Old Testament). The Torah is the Jewish Bible. The first Torah obtained was a paper military Torah which had been used in the Korean War. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although this allowed the congregation to read from a scroll, it was not “kosher,” meaning that it wasn’t handwritten on parchment. In 1985, Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, generously “loaned” one to GSJC “permanently.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2012, the congregation took on another holy task. With Rabbi Shelley Becker’s encouragement, GSJC members raised $20,000, to become “shomrim” or guardians of a rescued Holocaust Torah scroll. Some GSJC members are descendants of Holocaust survivors making this very personal. President Obama sent a letter to the congregation recognizing this achievement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These rescued scrolls, maintained by the Memorial Scrolls Trust, all come from Eastern Europe and were hidden during World War II.&nbsp; GSJC is one of the smallest congregations which cares for one. The Torah has sections from three eras, going back to the 1600’s. It has been repaired over the decades including in the 1800’s after pogroms. This Torah was from the towns of Caslav and Golcuv-Jenikov in Bohemia, both destroyed by the Nazis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, as the congregation prepared for the anniversary, it has created a timeline on its website. Finally, many “firsts” and significant events are all listed in one place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gishrei Shalom participates actively in the Apple Harvest Festival, providing volunteer staff on Sunday mornings for the First Congregational Church booth. The Apple Harvest Festival which everyone loves, has provided some challenges for GSJC members over the years in two ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are years when Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year which includes a 25-hour fast. When the smell of apple fritters from the Lutheran booth wafts across the parking lot during the fast, it can test personal discipline. There are also years, including 2024, when Yom Kippur falls during one of the Apple Harvest weekends and the whole congregation must move the Torah, its cabinet called “the ark,” prayer books, etc. to a different location. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GSJC has always included some community-based events in its schedule and since GSJC’s congregation draws from several towns, including Bristol, New Britain and Plainville, some services are held in those towns as well.&nbsp; As an example, Chanukah celebrations have been held at a Bristol member’s home since 1994.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2006, after much discussion, GSJC adopted a new name, Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregation. Gishrei Shalom means “Bridges to Peace.” The congregation has been a member of the Southington Interfaith Clergy organization for decades and participates in the interfaith Thanksgiving Service and other interfaith initiatives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GSJC has also been an active member in providing community service from helping feed those in need on Christmas Day, first at St. Dominic’s but now at Bread for Life. The congregation also collects bags of food on Yom Kippur for Bread for Life and participates in Rise Against Hunger in addition to many other community social justice efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, as the congregation enters its fifth decade in the community, there is excitement about new initiatives and concerns about bigger issues including anti-Semitism and smaller issues such as maintaining the budget for the 35-family community. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the mood is upbeat. Current President Marc Romanow says, “Allison and I have truly enjoyed our 12 years at GSJC, more so than any previous synagogue we have been associated with. The community is caring, engaging, welcoming and inclusive. I have also been blessed with a wonderful board of directors and officers these last 5 years. Everyone pitches in, which embodies the essence of teamwork."</p>
