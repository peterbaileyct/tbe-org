<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Connecticut Residents Encouraged to Apply for Assistance Before June 30, 2022</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Governor Ned Lamont today announced the launch of a new online application for heating and water assistance programs that help income-eligible families from Connecticut pay their utility bills. Eligible residents can now apply for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) and the Low-Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) through a joint online application that is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://ct.gov/heatinghelp/apply"><strong>ct.gov/heatinghelp/apply</strong></a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The state has extended by one month the deadline by which households can apply for benefits for the 2021-2022 season from the original deadline of May 31, 2022, to the new deadline of June 30, 2022. Additionally, for qualifying households that use oil or propane, the state will pay for fuel deliveries through May 31, 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/heatinghelp/Connecticut-Energy-Assistance-Program-CEAP">CEAP</a>&nbsp;is a federally funded program that provides winter heating assistance to more than 75,000 income-eligible households every year. Eligible families can receive between $410 to $1,015 in basic benefits alone. Families may also be eligible for matching payment plans, protection from shutoffs, and replacement or repairs for heating equipment and water heaters. Both homeowners and renters are eligible, and assistance is available for natural gas and electric heat, as well as deliverable fuels like oil and propane.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DSS/Highlights/Low-Income-Household-Water-Assistance-Program-Coming-to-CT">LIHWAP</a>&nbsp;provides water assistance to the same families who are eligible for CEAP, and eligible families can receive up to $1,000 in household water and wastewater benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The programs are administered through local Community Action Agencies (CAAs) across the state. In addition to applying online at&nbsp;<a href="https://ct.gov/heatinghelp/apply"><strong>ct.gov/heatinghelp/apply</strong></a>, residents can also contact their local CAA with additional questions or to apply for assistance in-person or over the phone.
