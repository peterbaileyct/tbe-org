<p>SIMSBURY - The Bristol public high schools were in the mix at the Stratton Brook Cross Country Invitational from Simsbury on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at Stratton Brook Park, the 3.1-mile course saw Bristol Central’s girls program top Bristol Eastern while on the boys side, the Lancers were a few places better than the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a tough start to the season with the heat and practice being what it was due to the treacherous conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls side in Simsbury, the Rams finished fifth overall in the large school division while the Lancers placed seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s wheelhouse of Sophia Stark (11th, 24:07) and Katie Tran (14th, 24:44) weren’t far off the top-10 pack while teammate Emma Cavallari (22nd, 26:09) also ran well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Eastern, senior Lauren Ayotte (31st, 27:38) was the top finisher for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was followed in order by Calliope Gallagher (32nd, 27:47) and Rita Gao (33rd, 28:07).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor, with 47 points, won the girls event while Norwich Free Academy (41) earned the nod for the boys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the boys, Eastern finished sixth, two spots ahead of the Rams (eighth).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, Patrick Wininger from Central was a top-five finisher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He placed fourth overall with a stellar time of 17:55 while teammate Rowan Hennessey (35th, 20:38) and Braydan Dwyer (38th, 20:58) showed some gumption on the course.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“</strong>[It was a] good day,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “We have a long way to go but I’m encouraged by our performances, especially with a smaller team this year. Patrick Wininger had a great run finishing fourth and for the girls Sophia Stark and Katie Tran got us off to a strong start. We also had some super JV performances led by Beckham Barse.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our freshmen look strong too led by Noah Pellerin, Naythan Pellerin, and Emersyn Mazzei.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The future is once again bright for the Central cross country programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top three runners for the Lancers boys included Jase Koczur (20th, 19:32), Cole Beland (24th, 20:00) and Brendan Tartarelli (33rd, 20:34).</p>
