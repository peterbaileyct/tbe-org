<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Blues have started the season out winning three of its first five games including the last two New England Collegiate Baseball League games from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Bristol’s Colin McVeigh threw three scoreless innings in relief as the Blues sank the Danbury Westerners by a 2-1 push in the team’s home opener from Bristol on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McVeigh struck out four and did not allow a walk to nab the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starter Jack Moore threw the first four frames, allowing five hits, one earned run, and struck out three while Luke Garofalo earned a save in one inning of relief ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joseph Rios led the Bristol attack at the plate, going 2-of-3 with a double and an RBI, Cal Parrillo went 2-of-4 with a run scored and an RBI while Griffin Arnone, Jack Lynch, Carson Swank and Chaz Myers all tallied hits for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Renn Lints drew a tough luck loss for the Westerners (2-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the scoring in the showdown came during the second though fourth innings as Danbury led 1-0 through two and then the visitors gave up solitary runs in the third and fourth frames as Bristol seized the edge for good midway through the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by a run, Parrillo singled on in the bottom of the second with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He advanced to second on a passed ball and scored on the Rios double as the contest was all tied up at 1-1 through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues won it in the fourth when Lynch reached base on an error, AJ Gaich walked, and the duo each advanced a base via a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Parrillo ended the scoring with an RBI single - plating Lynch - as the unearned run made it a 2-1 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol makes it two-in-a-row with victory over Sanford</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues won again from home on Friday, posting a 5-4 win over the winless Sanford Mainers (0-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanford etched up 11 hits but only one went for extra bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Tyler Fote nabbed two of Bristol’s seven hits, going 2-of-4 with a double, a run scored and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derek Tenney went 1-of-2 with two walks and a run scored while Rio nabbed a hit, two runs, and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Farley posted the victory for Bristol, allowing six hits, a lone earned run, and tallied four Ks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sonny Fauci took the loss for the Mainers (3 IP, three walks, four Ks).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by two through one completed inning, Rios and Fote each scored on a wild pitch to tie the event up at 2-2 after two frames of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanford added single runs in the sixth innings but in the bottom of the fifth, the Blues put the event away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaich walked and Arnone singled to put two on but off a 6-4-3 double play, Bristol had a man third with two away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney then walked, stole second, as the Blues had two men in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, an error at second on a Rios offering cleared the bases - making it a 4-3 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Fote doubled - scoring Rios for the winning run - as the home team led 5-3 through five, holding on to defeat Sanford by one in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blues fall at Keene on Saturday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undefeated Swamp Bats zipped up a four run fifth as Keene fended off Bristol, 6-3 to end the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Swamp Bats (5-0) are perfect in 2022 while the Blues fell to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney had two of Bristol’s eight hits while Gaich walked three times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Kohls drew the loss over his four inning, four earned run stint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also collected four strikeouts and walked just one.</p>
