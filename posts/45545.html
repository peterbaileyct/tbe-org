<p>Freshman pitcher Coby Dagata led St. Paul to a 6-1 win over Oxford to pick up his fourth win of the season at Oxford High School yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Dagata pitched six strong innings allowing only one run on three hits while striking out 11. Dom Napoletano finished the game for St. Paul striking out all three pinch hitters to face him. Starter Cole O'Connell took the loss for Oxford.</p>

<p>St. Paul got off to a good start as lead-off hitter Keaton Kroll walked and stole second. Cal Chance got Kroll to third with a ground out. Dagata followed with a double over the left fielder's head, and St. Paul led 1-0. Dagata advanced to third on AJ Corrado's ground out, and then scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0.</p>

<p>With singles by Jake Matusovich and Brando Fletter and a walk to Tyler Bergoderi, Oxford was able to load the bases with just one out in the bottom of the first. But Oxford was unable to score as Dagata struck out the next two batters to end the threat.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
