<p>BRISTOL – A few years back, in 2019 to be precise, Bristol Eastern boys soccer coach Bill Sweet earned his 400<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;all-time victory with a dominating road win at Hartford Public High School.<br>And on Monday afternoon, Sweet moved over the 425 win total as the Lancers belted the Owls by a 5-0 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 5-2 this season while Public (0-6) has yet to hit the pay window in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a good bounce-back victory for the program after a tough loss to Berlin in the previous match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Owls hung around early but simply could not crack the Eastern defense, led by outstanding keeper Peyton Cummings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Eastern’s Matthew Cabrera nabbed a first period goal and later assisted on a score while teammate Eddie Ansah dropped in a couple late goals to ice the affair.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We took control immediately and were able to dominate play against a game Public team," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "We moved the ball quickly and found open men"&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cabrera headed in&nbsp;the first goal at the 23:58 mark of the first period as the ball was not cleared by Hartford – making it a 1-0 game midway through things.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About three minutes later, Cabrera sent a pass wide to Rocco Barbino who collected it and drilled home the second goal of the showdown to double the Lancers’ cushion. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 2-0 push held into the halftime break before the Kingstreeters ramped up three additional goals to make it a five-goal lead to end the CCC showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second half, Liam Sanchez-Barreto was fouled in the penalty area and with 31:15 remaining, he scored on the ensuing penalty kick to post the Kingstreeters to a 3-0 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the event, Ansah notched back-to-back scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah blasted in his first goal with 11:24 left after Jeshua Portillo dribbled past three players and laid off a pass to the forward for the score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, with 7:49 showing on the clock, Ansah completed the scoring after cutting in from the wing, taking a Landon Gawel pass, and hitting a hard shot inside the near post – leading to the final 5-0 score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cummings (two) and Connor Murtaugh combined for two saves for Eastern while Public keeper Juan Arreaga stopped 13 shots over a solid effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the week, the Lancers will be involved in two big matches – one that will require several gallons of gas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Eastern travels to Edwin O. Smith High School for a 4:00 p.m. game in Storrs with the campus of the University of Connecticut looming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the ultimate challenge comes on a very special Saturday double dip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern travels to the turf field at Bristol Central on Saturday at 5:00 p.m. for the first game of a boy/girl doubleheader in a huge city series bonanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown should be a good one between the two squads.&nbsp;</p>
