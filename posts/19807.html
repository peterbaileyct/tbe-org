<p>SUFFIELD - For the first time in school history, the Bristol Central volleyball team is heading to the state semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a huge bout against No. 2 Suffield on Saturday night, the seventh ranked Rams knocked off the second seeded program three games to one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game scores were 25-10, 25-8, 10-25 and 25-16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has won nine of the 10 sets through postseason play in the Class L semifinal bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after No. 3 East Lyme defeated No. 11 Bristol Eastern 3-0 on Saturday, ending the possibility of what would have been an amazing all-Bristol semifinal, the Rams have their opponent set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vikings picked off the Kingstreeters via game scores of 25-12, 25-16 and 25-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in Class L action from Saturday, top ranked Joel Barlow blanked No. 8 Platt 25-16, 25-18 and 25-10 while two Cinderellas locked horns in a Class L surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 12 Woodstock flipped No. 13 Pomperaug in straight sets (26-24, 25-14, and 25-20) over a competitive bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L semifinal set-up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both semifinal contests will commence on Wednesday but will be contested from different venues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one Class L semifinal, Woodstock battles top ranked Barlow from the gymnasium at Sports and Medical Sciences Academy at 6 p.m. (the school has one of those cool retractable volleyball nets).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Central squares off against East Lyme on the same evening and time from Cromwell High School - setting up the championship round by the end of the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless of the rankings, the Class L semifinal showdowns are going to be a good one with No. 7 Bristol in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if youâ€™re looking ahead, the title contest for the Class L championship commences on November 19 from East Haven High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central wins big</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are now an impressive 18-7 after that four-set victory over No. 2 Suffield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four players from Central tallied up nine-plus kills against the Wildcats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Valentino led a balanced offensive attack at the net, posting a team-leading 13 kills while teammate Olivia Clingan added 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Higgins cracked the double-figuring killing attack with 10 while Maddie Lodovico swung down nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman sensation Lily Kirk flashed in three kills to pace an excellent hitting attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setter Alex Rivera added three aces and on the blocking front, Clingan (five) and Kirk (four) nearly rejected a combined double figure tally in that department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lodovico also added three blocks and 17 digs to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivera tallied 46 assists and 13 digs and then there was libero Sam Sklenka - protecting the backline with zest - bumping up a team-leading 28 digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams came out of the gate against powerful Suffield blazing - outscoring the Wildcats 50-18 over the first two sets of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suffield responded with a 15-point victory in set three but in the final game, the Rams - battled tested throughout the regular season - won the last game 25-16 to punch its first ever ticket to the semifinal round.</p>
