<p>Earlier in the month, World War II veteran and Iwo Jima survivor Joe Caminiti sat down with Vietnam War veteran John Lodovico to talk about Caminiti's life, including growing up in Bristol as well as his experiences on Iwo Jima.</p>

<p>The interview, part of a TBE-Bristol Historical Center initiative, attempts to capture in the words of Bristol people moments in history. Among the memories Caminiti shares is growing up on Highland Court, which no longer exists, taking trips into New York City with friends when he was a teenager and his combat experience.</p>

<p>Caminiti turned 100 years old on Sunday, Oct 13. He was honored at the American Legion Post 2 the day before. Earlier the mayor and city council proclaimed Sunday, "Joe Caminiti Day" in Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lodovico, as things would have it, has known Caminiti, his entire life. His father and Caminiti were best of friends. Caminiti was even there the day Lodovico was born. </p>

<p>The conversation took place Tuesday, Oct. 1, in the conference room at the Bristol Historical Society. On hand were BHS's Ellen Zoppo-Sassu and American Legion Post 2 historian Neal Supranovich.</p>
