<p>After 24 years as Bristol Town &amp; City Clerk, Therese Pac was told Friday by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano that her contract will not be renewed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We will be moving in a new direction,” the mayor told The Bristol Edition Sunday. As for her replacement, he said, “We do not have an identified candidate at this point.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pac, the daughter of former New Britain Mayor Stanley Pac, was appointed by Mayor Frank Nicastro in November of 1998 and approved by the city council, following the retirement of her predecessor, Florence McAuliffe.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2012, the Institute of Municipal Clerks designated her as Master Municipal Clerk for completing training requirements and having made “significant contributions” to her community and state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As described by the state of Connecticut, town clerks are public information officers and are responsible for public records, vital statistics, and licensing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the All-Heart Bristol website, an entry from 2018 calls the office one of the busiest in City Hall with over 90,000 transactions a year. "In 2018, there were 66,150 monetary transactions with over $3.5 million in revenue collected for the City of Bristol and the State of Connecticut. The department houses more than 2 million town and vital records – marriage certificates date back to 1816, birth and death certificates start in 1852, and land records begin in 1785."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the entry says that the office was one of the earliest adopters of technology and "accepted electronic recording of land records and implemented an on-line marriage worksheet making the process of applying for a marriage license more convenient in 2014."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2011, land record indexes have been on-line, while document images and maps have been electronically available since 2013. The article anticipates that over 2,100 land record volumes dating back to 1785 would be accessible electronically by early 2020. TBE was unable to confirm the latter.</p>

<p>Among her multitude of duties associated with her position, Ms. Pac was familiar to most in her capacity as the official secretary at city council meetings.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
