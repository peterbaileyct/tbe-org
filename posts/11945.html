<p>In the upcoming Board of Finance meeting on Tuesday, the Board will consider requests from the American Rescue Plan Task Force to approve $17,105,980 in funding for groups that applied for the money under ARP criteria. <br><br>The City of Bristol will receive approximately $28 million in ARPA funding over the next five years; this is the first request of the task force for funds. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The 15-member ARPA Task Force, comprised of appointed members from the community, was formed to help determine how these funds will be distributed to benefit the Bristol community.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three subcommittees were formed to focus on the following priority areas: Nonprofit groups, Business Recovery, and City Use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The following Guiding Principles were used as the framework for the most effective deployment of these resources:</h2>
