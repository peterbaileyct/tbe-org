<p>In their award description, the CLHO wrote,&nbsp;“In this thoroughly researched and lavishly illustrated book, horology scholar Mary Jane&nbsp;Dapkus&nbsp;investigates new primary sources and court records that expand upon a previous biography of Joseph Ives. One of Connecticut’s most inventive and best-loved clockmakers, Ives made some of the first metal-geared clocks in the United States. Her examination of over 150 court cases revealed the early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century economics of&nbsp;clockmaking&nbsp;and business relationships. A crucial discovery was made about an unreliable investor who was instrumental in Ives’ struggles for financial success, which caused him to sell the rights to his patents to pay debts. The book includes an analysis&nbsp;[written b<a></a>y Peter Gosnell]&nbsp;of the looking glass clock movements and their importance to the broader context of both Connecticut’s and America’s technological history.”</p>
