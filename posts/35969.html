<p>In an exciting CCC interdivisional encounter, the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team ramped up an impressive 1-0 victory over Wethersfield on Wednesday night from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles, who entered the showdown with only one blemish on their record, fell to 7-2-4 overall while the Lancers improved to a stellar 8-4-1 with some huge matches on tap over the next week or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a make-up game from an early September rainout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters jumped on Wethersfield early, moving the ball quickly with crisp passing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 33:36 of the first half, one such combination brought the game's only goal - meaning pay window time for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Veteran Rocco Barbino took a Landon Gawel clearance and gave Liam Sanchez-Barreto a through ball that beat the Wethersfield flat back four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanchez broke in on goal and lofted a ball over Wethersfield keeper Nathan Morris into the upper right corner of the net for the game’s only score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Unlike some of our previous games, we dominated early and got the lead," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "It was a battle throughout, though, as Wethersfield overall had much of the play in the center of the field.&nbsp; Our defense kept them from getting good looks at the goal, except for a few free kicks, and Peyton Cummings, in goal, was sharp.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cummings tallied eight saves over another supreme effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Counterpart Morris nabbed five - letting just one ball get by him that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Wethersfield had more possession over second half play, it was the Lancers who just missed padding their lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goal-scoring machine Eddie Ansah had a shot just go by the post and Matt Cabrera sent a hard shot that rang the crossbar but bounced out to keep things a one possession game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, in the end, one goal was enough.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern travels to Southington on Tuesday (4:45 p.m.) for a CCC interdivisional bout against the Knights.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals close the regular season hosting Bristol Central at 7:15 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 26 in what should be a tremendous night of soccer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, the rematch will be contested from the confines of Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time the two Bristol squads squared off, the Lancers were able to topple the Rams by a 2-1 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the season becomes all about playoff positioning for the Kingstreeters with two CCC challengers remaining on the docket.</p>
