<p>Four long-time Democrats will be honored by the Democratic Town Committee at a recognition dinner in mid-June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four are Andre Dorval, who served as Judge of Probate for 26 years; Thomas O'Brien, who has been active in local politics for 40 years; John E. Smith, who recently completed his final term with the Board of Finance; and Christopher Wilson, who served for about a decade as the chair of the Board of Education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from serving as probate judge, Dorval has been an active member of the DTC, running a law office and serving as a trustee at St. Ann Church.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>O'Brien began his involvement with local politics as a councilmember, and then moved on to both the appointed and elected Board of Education, serving as chair of personnel and finance committees. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to his work guiding the city's finances, Smith served as liaison to many school building committees, culminating with the opening of the Memorial Boulevard School transformation to the Bristol Arts &amp; Innovation Magnet School and the Rockwell Theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson served as chair of the Board of Education during the time when the board transitioned to K-8 and sold three elementary schools, demolished another to rebuild and renovated the Boulevard. He has also served on the Bristol Business Education Foundation and is active at Prospect United Methodist Church. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
