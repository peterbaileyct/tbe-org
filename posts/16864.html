<p>High School football season kicks off Friday night, with fans eager to see gridiron action from the Rams and Lancers. As we look forward to a new season, here’s a look back on the past year in Bristol high school football.</p>

<h3>Bristol Central</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2021-22 season was one of historic wins and broken records for the Rams. Led by Gatorade Player of the Year Victor Rosa, Bristol Central finished their regular season 9-1. After suffering a tough 7-6 season opening loss to Bloomfield, Central went on to win all nine remaining games. Central won the 2021 Battle of the Bell on Thanksgiving Day, finishing their regular season with a 49-14 victory over Eastern. The Rams earned a trip to the Class L quarterfinals for the first time since 1987, where they fell 49-14 to Maloney.  </p>

<p>Victor Rosa was incomparable on the gridiron in 2021. The 5’11’’ 195 lbs. athlete was also named MaxPreps Player of the Year and earned All-State honors. Rosa rushed for 2,728 yards, passed for 849 yards, and scored 41 touchdowns in 11 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2021 Rams also had tremendous showings from All-State players Dan Lauretti (Offense) and Malachi Jones (Defense). The Rams’ offense had 4,443 total yards of offense, averaging 403.9 yards per game.</p>

<p>The Rams open their 2022-23 season at home against Manchester.</p>

<h3>Bristol Eastern</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The talent on the 2021-22 Lancer’s roster was far greater than their 4-6 record would have you believe. Eastern started the season hot with two straight wins, including a huge 35-6 season-opening victory over E.O. Smith. October proved to be a month of heartbreaking losses, with three games lost by 6 points or less. Their 21-15 loss to Capital Prep, 21-20 loss to Plainville and harrowing 23-22 overtime loss to South Windsor pulled Eastern’s record under .500 in a season that had the potential to go 7-3.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior running back Alex Marshall shattered a 25-year program record, becoming Eastern’s all-time single-season rushing leader. The previous record was set by Reinaldo Soto in 1996 with 1,173 yards. During his senior season, Marshall rushed for an incredible 1,728 yards, with 21 touchdowns on 290 carries.</p>
