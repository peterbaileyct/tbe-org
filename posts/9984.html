<h4>This is a recent press release from the City of Bristol.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, the Bristol Adult Resource Center (BARC) was awarded a $70,000 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) by the City of Bristol to replace the damaged roof on their Jerome Avenue facility. This capital project, funded by HUD, is part of the City’s 47-year CDBG program that provides grant funds to non-profit agencies serving low income residents or populations with special needs. The roof at BARC was damaged by high winds during a storm, and while temporary repairs prevented extensive water damage inside the building, replacement of the roof was urgently needed before any further weather events. </p>

<p>“The work done by BARC and many other non-profits is critical to many residents and their families,” stated Dawn Leger, Grants Administrator and coordinator of the CDBG program for the City. “In addition to the dozens of clients served by BARC every day, it is one of the city’s largest employers and an important resource in our community.” </p>

<p>Howard Schmelder, chairman of the CDBG Policy Committee of the Economic and Community Development Board, also praised the organization for its contributions. “BARC is a good steward of the funds they have been awarded through this program, and we are pleased to see all the good work happening here,” he said, citing the Hidden Café and Jerome Gardens greenhouse programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“On behalf of BARC’s Board of Directors, staff, and individuals served, I would like to thank the City of Bristol for this generous grant. Our roof is ready for the upcoming winter, and we are so glad to not have to worry about any potential interruption to our programs that could have arisen from our old roof. We are very grateful for the support of our community partners like the City,” stated Mary Etter, Executive Director of the Bristol Adult Resource Center.</p>

<p><strong>The Hidden Café – A “Hidden Treasure” Here in Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hidden Café, located at BARC has been in business for almost 40 years,&nbsp;serving&nbsp;lunch from 11:30 to 2:00 Monday through Friday. BARC clients are employed at the Hidden Café and have jobs of&nbsp;seating customers, setting tables, taking customer orders, delivering food, and clearing tables, which helps them&nbsp;stay focused and&nbsp;gives them the&nbsp;ability to work independently.&nbsp;It also allows them the opportunity to&nbsp;learn other skills as well like counting money and interacting with the public.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am hopeful that the Hidden Café will open for customers in late winter/early spring. Our biggest issue is that we have so many individuals in that program, and they can’t all be in the kitchen at one time. With social distancing, we take up the whole dining room for them. But we are currently open for takeout, and we are looking forward to fully utilizing the patio this spring,” stated Mary Etter,&nbsp;Executive Director of the Bristol Adult Resource Center.</p>
