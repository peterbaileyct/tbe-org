<p>The Crocodile Club returns Aug. 12 at Lake Compounce, as it has over the past decade, as a fundraiser for the Carousel Museum, this year with WTIC News Talk 1080's Brian Shactman as master of ceremonies and Special Guest Bristol native Mike Reiss, showrunner, writer and producer of The Simpsons.</p>

<p>The menu will be the traditional sheep roast from the event's inception in 1875 when founder of Lake Compounce Gad Norton sponsored the luncheon to thank state legislators for changing the Bristol's border to include the amusement park, which had been in Southington.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A draw for the event is that it attracts legislators from both sides of the aisle and includes a healthy dose of joking, oftentimes pushing the boundaries of polite repartee, for a laugh at the legislators' expense.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The $50 a person ticket includes the traditional sheep roast fare, a drink, the friendly political roast in the Crocodile Club tradition, admission to Lake Compounce, support for the Carousel Museum and a cigar.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access ten (10) articles per week.&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;</li></ul>
