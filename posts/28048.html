<p>NORWICH – Winners of four straight games, the Bristol 17U American Legion baseball squad has displayed the same dominance on the road as it has from Riley Field in town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Thursday afternoon, Post 2 foiled Norwich by a 5-1 final from the Norwich Little League Complex.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norwich, also comprised of players from Sprague, Franklin, Preston and Bozrah, had to survive a five-error game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Norwich squad was two-hit by the Bristol combination of Jonathan Montgomery and Gabe White.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery went five innings, allowing just one earned run, while White did not yield anything to Norwich over his two innings (37 pitches).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Canny drew the loss for the home program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 scooped up six hits as Luke Colfer led the charge going 2-of-3 from the plate with a double and two RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Simard, Caleb Molinsky, Mason Harris and White all tallied hits for the winners.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian Grabowski scored two runs while Brayden Schenck added another for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norwich fell to 3-6-1 and trailed 4-0 through just two innings of action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 notched two runs over both the first and second frames to snare that 4-0 push and added another tally to the scoreboard in the fourth to make it a 5-1 game which was too much for Norwich to battle back from.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entering Saturday morning, Bristol is a sterling 10-2 and is in second place in the Zone 3 standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford still hangs in third place (10-3), half-a-game in back of Bristol in third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where are they playing next?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After falling to South Windsor (4-0) from Rotary Park on Saturday, a long trip down to Waterford for a Zone 3 affair at noon on Sunday followed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That game was contested at Waterford High School - weather permitting.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
