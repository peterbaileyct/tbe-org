<p>Millions of basketball fans will tune in around the country on Saturday night to watch the 4th-seeded UConn Huskies (29-8) take on the 5th-seeded Miami Hurricanes (29-7) in the NCAA Men's Final Four.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here in Bristol, a city of 60,000 people, all eyes will be on hometown hero Donovan Clingan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan became an early season standout for the Huskies, racking up 15 points and 10 rebounds to be named tournament MVP in the championship game of the Phil Knight Invitational in November. The 7’2" center continued to play an integral role in UConn’s successful 22-23 season, boasting a 65.5 field goal percentage.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan’s high school career was one of broken records and extraordinary achievements, including winning the prestigious Gatorade Player of the Year award twice (2021 and 2022).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During his senior season, Clingan averaged 30.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 6.2 blocks per game. Throughout the 21-22 season, he scored multiple triple-doubles and set a personal record of 51 points scored in a single game, against Windsor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before a packed crowd at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium, Clingan claimed his 2,000th career point during the cross-town classic at Bristol Eastern High School. He finished his senior year as the 7th&nbsp;all-time high school Connecticut scorer.&nbsp;</p>
