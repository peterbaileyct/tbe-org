<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team finally hit the pay window last Thursday night, dropping Platt by a 6-0 final in Meriden in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, now 1-3-1, earned that first victory behind four first-half goals and cruised the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern out-shot Platt 27-0 overall and enjoyed a 13-0 advantage on shots on goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers did not give Lancer keepers Abigale Pelletier and Hailey Beebe much to sweat about that night as the home program couldn’t muster a shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern held a 6-1 edge on corner kicks while Panthers’ keeper Zaniyah Duncan tallied seven saves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens and Megan Krok each tallied two goals apiece while Maria Perrone and Kate Patterson nabbed single scores for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maddie Gonneville, Stavens, Krok, and Beebe all zipped up assists for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s first goal game ten minutes in when Stavens won a goal kick and blasted in a shot for a 1-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four minutes later, during a scramble in front of the Platt goal, Perrone found the ball at her feet and perfectly placed a chip shot over the keeper&nbsp;that made it 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens kept the pressure on two minutes later as her blast hit the post on a breakaway, but Krok was there to clean it up, which pumped the Eastern edge up to 3-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with 21 minutes to go over the first forty, Krok set up Stavens off a corner kick for a score - propelling the Lancers to a 4-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second half, with 32:00 remaining,&nbsp;Beebe received a pass in the box, passed it off to Gonneville whose shot was blocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Krok was again in the right place and buried the scraps for a 5-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, with 20 minutes showing on the clock, Patterson broke through and finished with a goal to cap the scoring, propelling the Lancers to a huge 6-0 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s next match is against another Meriden program, this time Maloney, on Tuesday from Alumni Field at 6 p.m. in Bristol.</p>
