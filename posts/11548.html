<p>Come Sunday morning, the second of three grandkids will have turned two years old, and enjoyed the big day as only a two-year-old might--pushing through, fighting that nap, lost in the bump bump bump swirl of brightly colored helium balloons, having gotten to choose one with a Disney theme, cajoling anyone and everyone at the party to join in play with new toys, and mashing the frosting from the specialty Sesame Street-themed cupcakes on to the table top, after announcing that blue playdough didn't really make tasty frosting.</p>

<p>All in all, the party was a success as was his mom's homemade meatballs and sauce, added liberally to freshly made Harvest Bakery rolls for the meal--a first attempt in what we all hope is another link in continuing family celebration with the new generation. I can remember when I was a kid there was always a pot of sauce and meatballs--or chicken or sausage or pork chops or some combination--simmering on the stove not only on special occasions but on most days. And then as the family grew, that sauce and contents being a regular at more and more of our celebrations.</p>

<p>The week started with the Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast, sponsored by the local chapter of the NAACP, and held at Bristol Eastern High School. The breakfast had been postponed from its original date on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This year's keynote speaker was Alicia Hernandez-Strong, co-founder of the New Britain Racial Justice Coalition. Her address began simply with the admonition that success is often the result of not only our efforts but as a result of the efforts of the people around us. In other words, no one gets ahead without help. </p>

<p>Of course, while TBE focuses its efforts on the local level, it goes without saying that the week will be remembered for the atrocity that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By Sunday, Russia, in another duplicitous move, engaged its nuclear arsenal as part of what it called a step towards deterring Western aggression. I am guessing that there are people with ties to the Ukraine nation here in Bristol. I would appreciate an email so that we might talk about some of the repercussions of this Russian aggression, and if possible, to share with our readers.</p>

<p>Regarding our own local effort, TBE will begin its membership program--one I announced last week but that did not get off the ground immediately because we are still working out a few details. After getting to our pages, readers will be alerted to the membership drive and asked to consider a monthly donation. Memberships are necessary if we are going to continue to grow TBE, to cover Bristol news more completely. In addition, we have incorporated as a nonprofit, the idea being we need to be a viable business to fulfill our mission rather than relying solely on volunteers.</p>
