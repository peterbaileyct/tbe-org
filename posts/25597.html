<p>BRISTOL - The game is once again upon us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s time for a city series clash as the softball squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern take center stage tonight in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs are poised to qualify for postseason play and this showdown – at least weather wise – should go off without a hitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be a special nighttime challenge which will see Eastern as the home team from Casey Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a few things to know about the teams as Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern lock horns for the first time this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol City Series Softball - CCC South Attraction</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL at BRISTOL EASTERN</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong>Casey Field</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date: </strong>Monday, May 1</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Implications:&nbsp;</strong>The visiting team, Bristol Central, is looking to keep its undefeated ledger on the line while home standing Bristol Eastern hopes to make it five wins in its last six tries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Records:&nbsp;</strong>Bristol Central 10-0 overall; Bristol Eastern 5-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coaches: </strong>Monica Hayes (Eighth year as coach at Bristol Central); Tyler Catlin (Second season at Bristol Eastern)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who to know, Bristol Central:&nbsp;</strong>Playing the Rams is like watching Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome (except with a softball twist).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s two pitchers enter and it’s either Central’s Pia Torreso or Alex Sciarretto that leaves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about the path of destruction Torreso and Sciarretto, both future NCAA Division I pitchers, have carved over the past two seasons for the program at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dominating duo have led the Rams to a 32-5 ledger of their last 37 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s an incredible record only a couple teams in the state could match over that same time frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you take the combined ERA of Sciarretto and Torreso and turn that number into money, you could possibly buy a 12 ounce soda with it (25 years ago).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catching for the dynamic duo is senior standout Lorelei Stancavage, a tremendous hand behind the plate – one of the many senior leaders in the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of leadership, second baseman Kaley Laird is a slick leadoff hitter and the queen of small ball, Sam Sklenka, nearly gets on base off every bunt she lays down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throw in senior shortstop Adrianna Lubrico into the mix and you have an experienced senior crew at the plate and around the infield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Mya Porrini is a tough third baseman and the outfield led by Sam Sklenka in center, also has sister Leah Sklenka in right and the junior has a stick at the top of the batting order to match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Desiree Nickerson in left, a hugely talented athlete, is a future star for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Lilly VanNostrand has also cracked the lineup and can smack the ball around the park towards the tail-end of the batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is experienced, talented in all the major positions and is looking for win No. 11 on Monday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Monica Hayes has been through these BC/BE wars as both a player and now a coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She is looking to get above .500 for her career against Eastern with a win tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The competition</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What competition?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going back to the ERA of the pitching studs from Central, knowing the fact that the Rams have yielded just six runs over 10 games speaks volumes about that nearly nonexistent number.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the final six games of April, Central has outscored its opponent, 62-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is even worth looking at ERAs at that point?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just last week, the Rams outscored Platt and Maloney 10-2 and that would be considered ‘close’ in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, what competition?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rankings and Record</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Rams are ranked sixth in the most recent GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only teams rated above Central are Southington, Fairfield Ludlowe, Masuk of Monroe, Newtown and the self-professed ‘future’ 2023 state champions at Woodland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who are the only two teams that are still undefeated in all the Central Connecticut Conference?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington is one and the other is from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will that change by the completion of the showdown against Bristol Eastern on Monday night?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who to know, Bristol Eastern: </strong>Don’t underestimate Eastern’s 5-4 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a city series battle in which all the statistics are thrown out the window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have the capability to hang on loss on several good programs (the team’s 2022 run to the Class L semifinals proves that very point) and should be a tough out over the back half of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers, outside of a blowout loss at home to Maloney, has been on a bit of a roll over the last couple weeks or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outfielder Emily Valentine leads the offense for the Lancers as the sophomore has blasted out 16 hits while batting a slick .533 – including 14 runs scored, four doubles and 10 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin is a dual threat whenever she takes the field or battling from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s kicked in an average of .409 with nine hits and 10 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin carried an ERA of 4.12 towards the end of April and leads the squad in strikeouts, innings pitched and wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior, who can also play over at first base as well, could be a tough assignment for Central to handle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Kayla Webber (.462 average) is tied for second on the program with 12 hits while senior Jazmyn Browne (.387) is a speedy shortstop that had a half-dozen extra base hits to her name and has seen her share of BC/BE softball battles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valentine and Browne are the leaders on the program in runs scored (14).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior catcher Sarah Lacouture (.333) can also hit the ball and junior Makayla Antunes (.292) added seven hits and batted in seven runs to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Grace Browne (.300) has nine hits and nine RBI and is another steady hand in the outfield and sophomore Hailey Beebe (.258) can play multiple positions around the diamond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s pitched a few games already this season and has ability in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Central cannot sleep on this squad as there’s too much ability here to be underestimated over a full seven inning affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head Coach Tyler Catlin has been there and done that and will have his troops ready for their biggest game of the season to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rankings and Record</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Lancers are floating just over .500 with recent wins against South Windsor (22-3 from Casey Field), St. Paul Catholic (6-5), Platt (7-1) and Manchester (5-1) this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was after a 1-3 start with two tough losses against Berlin and a close three run setback at Maloney (11-8) on April 17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two of Eastern’s five victories this year, the Kingstreeters scored 21-plus runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, however, isn’t exactly Simsbury or South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s the bottom line here?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Central and Eastern are 7-7 against each other over their last 14 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the rubber match of sorts between the programs seven years in the making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it’s a city series showdown and anything is possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, how do the Lancers compete against one (of two) NCAA Division I pitchers with perfect games and no hitters to their names already this season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why not come down to Casey Field at 6 p.m. and watch for yourself as BC and BE are on the docket Monday night, under the lights.</p>
