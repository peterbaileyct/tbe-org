<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern football team is desperately looking to finish the season at .500 and how sweet would it be to get to 5-5 with a victory over city rival Bristol Central?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams employ the best player in the state offensively but the Lancers’ senior standout, back Alex Marshall, isn’t planning on playing second fiddle that afternoon -- to anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Marshall has a chance to become Eastern’s top single season rusher in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s also other weapons out on the field wearing the blue and gray that will give Central plenty of fits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>True, Eastern has some injuries and won’t have certain quarterbacks and special team options that started the campaign available, but you’ll won’t be hearing any excuses from the Lancers’ program -- win or lose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is ready for this game, is looking forward to this extreme challenge and has a plan to stop - or at least slow down - one of the top rushing weapons in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what Turkey Day looks like from the Bristol Eastern point of view:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Anthony (never call me A.J. in print) Julius (looking for his first Thanksgiving Day victory)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date and Time of the Clash</strong>: The teams lock horns on Thanksgiving morning, 10:30 am, from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last BC showdown (2019)</strong>: In overtime, the Lancers fell to Central, 34-32 and haven’t won on Thanksgiving since a 20-18 victory back in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Eastern trails in the all-time series 36-23-2, hoping to break a five-game losing streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Series Fact</strong>: The Lancers and Rams’ game in 2019 was the third showdown that ended up tied after regulation. It was also the first one settled in overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>: Alex Marshall (sr. TB/LB); Luke Dauphinee (sr. G/NG); Nate Shorette (sr. WR/S); Conor McCormick (sr. TE/DE); Alex Vita (sr. T/T); Brady Brown (jr. QB/LB); Jeremy Kolloverja (jr. WR/LB); Austin Shorette (jr. LB); Connor Gimpl (jr. C/E); Cooper Harris (jr. T/DL); Wyatt Scarritt (so. T/DL); Joseph Arborio (jr. G/DL); Kamden Laprise (fr. QB/DB/injured); Rayshon Andrews (so. WR/DB); Kyle Babin (jr. WR/CB); Jaiden Fore (so. FB/LB); Josh Aubin (so. RB/LB); Dylan Bradley (sr. DB); Malik Sherrill (sr. DB/K); Adam Zavecz (so. LB); Chase Dauphinee (fr. K); Gavin Damboise (fr. K/injured).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Captains: </strong>Conor McCormick, Alex Marshall, Luke Dauphinee and Alex Vita.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern Team Record</strong>: 4-5 overall, winning its last game against Farmington (54-22).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Eastern will win</strong>…The Lancers have been hard to predict this season and easily could have entered Thanksgiving at 6-3 instead of 4-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last-second loss at Plainville, plus the overtime defeat to South Windsor, was by a combined two points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t shake the Lancers and this team won’t be an easy out against the Rams either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior back Alex Marshall needs just 75 yards to top Reinaldo Soto’s single season record of 1,713 yards - established during his sophomore season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of senior year rushing, no other back in Eastern program history has rushed for more yards as a senior than Marshall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not Reinaldo Soto (1,586 yards in 1998), not David Casanova (1,530 yards in 2007), not Gerry Ouellette (1,517 yards in 2014), not anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going into Thursday, Marshall has 1,638 yards on 271 carries -- good for 20 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of the Thanksgiving, Marshall is third all-time in rushing yardage at BE with 2,615 yards -- all coming over two seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s as tough as they come, craves the contact, and will just keep churning yards on the ground -- even if three or four bodies are in the way, attempting to slow him down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His average of 6.0 yards-per-carry is tremendous and Marshall leads the squad with smarts, heady play, and plenty of guile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman QB Kamden Laprise is out of action due to injury and that means junior Brady Brown will be taking the snaps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He doesn’t throw the ball a ton but Brown has only been sacked once this year, averages 4.1 yards-per-carry and is a viable second or third option to give Marshall a breather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Brown can get a pass or two off, he’ll make connections with Nate Shorette (10 catches, 130 yards, TD) and Conor McCormick (5-97-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of blocking, Julius will use tight ends, receivers, linemen, (possibly Wilbur) and everyone else not running with the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means athletes like Jeremy Kolloverja will be busy early and often blocking while sophomore Jaiden Fore has done a tremendous job all season blazing the trail for Marshall to run through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Shorette has been used in conjunction with Fore at times in Eastern’s offensive schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those reads will get tougher with Central’s athletic line on defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern’s offensive line isn’t too shabby either with Conor McCormick (he’s an excellent emergency punter as well), Wyatt Scarritt, Luke Dauphinee, Alex Vita and Joseph Arborio leading the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even with the injuries, missing personnel and what-not, the Lancers are going to have chances against a bigger and quicker Central defensive front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The X-Factor</strong>…It’s junior Rayshon Andrews.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrews, a talented junior, has been tremendous as of late and has the speed to steer clear of hungry defenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied over 200 yards on the ground in Eastern’s last contest against Farmington and averages a staggering 18.9 yards-per-carry on just 17 rushes this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have four receptions for TDs this season with Andrews (13 catches, 108 yards, two touchdowns) leading the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he gets the ball, he makes an immediate impact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s defense will also make stops and could be considered an x-factor as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Eastern’s tallied 44 tackles-for-losses, taking away 124 yards from opponents in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Shorette leads the squad in that department with 11.5 TFLs - good for 23.5 yards lost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marshall and Connor Gimpl are also leaders in that department as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has eight sacks on the season with Austin Shorette making 4.5 of those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trying to chase down Central’s Victor Rosa is going to be an epic challenge but not an impossible one with enough bodies in the way - making tackles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern can't</strong>…make this game an up-and-down affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, Hartford Public and Tolland decided not to play much defense against Central and attempted to keep up with the Rams offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that was a very bad mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public dropped in 48 points against Central while Tolland scored 50 and those two tallies, on any given Friday (or Saturday for the Owls), should have been enough to earn a win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams combined to score 120 total points against the Owls and Eagles - leading to doom and demise for those other programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone pointed to the lack of defense by Central at midseason but didn’t notice what was happening on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every stop must count if the Lancers want to beat the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s simply not a big margin for error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marshall, Eastern’s leading tackler, along with Josh Aubin, Kyle Babin, Austin Shorette, Jeremy Kolloverja, Andrews, and crew must make the initial contact stick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa will go in fifty directions at once and if he’s allowed any kind of space or room, it’s going to be a high-scoring affair in Central’s favor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern’s defense yields just 20.7 points-per-game this year - nearly identical to Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And out of the halftime gate, opponents have tallied just 28 third period points as adjustments made at the half have obviously paid off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>…This is going to be an epic challenge but not an impossible one for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern program has enjoyed its best record since 2014 when the Lancers went 7-4 and last defeated the Rams on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that season, Eastern has won just five games and can equal that total this year with a win over Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are big, athletic, and talented but the Lancers have enough in its toolbox to frustrate Central - just like Eastern did against Bloomfield a few weeks ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All eyes will be on Rosa but not paying attention to Marshall and company could be a huge mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And the winner is</strong>…Did you know that the song <em>John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt </em>originates from the United States and Canada?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a one verse tune that just repeats over, and over, and over, and over again (My kid <em>loves </em>that ridiculous song…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just like that fact that Central wins on Thanksgiving over and over and over again, Eastern is looking to change the tune on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did I answer the question?</p>
