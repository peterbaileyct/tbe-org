<p>Gerard J. A. Quintin, Sr, 95, formerly of Bristol, for 65 years, passed away on Sunday, Aug. 27. For the past 1.5 years, he and his wife Violet lived with their daughter Linda and son-in-law Bob in Old Saybrook. Jerry, as he was lovingly called, was born in 1928 in Sanford, Maine, son of the late Edmond and Clara (Bruneau) Quintin.</p>

<p>Jerry grew up on a farm in Maine and enjoyed sharing stories about his childhood. The life lessons from the farm impacted the way he lived his life, with a concern and appreciation for conservation as well as a strong work ethic. At 17 years old, toward the end of World War II, Jerry joined the U.S. Navy and served overseas in London, Morocco, and many other places. Fluent in French, one of his many jobs was being an interpreter for American soldiers. After WWII, Jerry met and married the love of his life, Violet (Lambert) Quintin, to whom he had been married to for 72 years.</p>

<p>Jerry’s favorite pastime was spending countless hours in his boat catching both fresh and saltwater fish. He also enjoyed gardening and had a green thumb, growing many crops over the years, with a special affinity for tomatoes. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
