<p>PLAINVILLE - It was mission accomplished for the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team in terms of opening night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, drawing a tough first-game assignment at Plainville, had to hold on in the end as the visiting aggression posted a big 66-51 win from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium at PHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters led wire-to-wire, never giving the Blue Devils any real traction in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had perfect balance from its starters and then timely contributions from the bench in posting that all-important first victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In past seasons, when the Plainville program made a late game run, a younger Lancers’ squad didn’t always respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of those setbacks belonged to inexperience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this current squad has experience, chemistry and has been playing together all year long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it showed over the 15-point victory on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tonight it did and it has to show as the season progresses,” said Eastern coach Bunty of the squad’s maturity and growth. “I have guys out there with a lot of minutes. They know what to do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern starting unit - Brady Bell, Zaveyn Tate, Jordan Chisholm, and captains Brayden Dauphinais and Lukas Sward - all played at least 20 minutes against the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting those types of minutes from that five-pack of athletes is critical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the bench - as it’s expected to do all season long - chipped in 38 minutes, producing double-figures in scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D’Amato was 2-of-3 in 11 minutes, Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum added three rebounds in 13 minutes and Naseem Walker (five points) was perfect from the field and free throw line over 12 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was able to go to my bench early which helped with fatigue,” said Ray. “In years past, we had guys playing too many minutes, playing tired. I thought being able to sub early really helped us late in the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s big for us. This is a physical, physical game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Plainville contest was certainly physical and Eastern had to match those physicalities as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers did exactly that and when Plainville pushed, Eastern pushed&nbsp; right back from both the starters and reserves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Every night, someone is going to be out there, banging you around, trying to get the ball from you,” said Ray. “Having our guys out there today being able to negotiate the floor, be a little bit rested and being a little calmer was helpful.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning in Plainville has not been easy over the years as the squad is usually well coached, plays with grit and is always a tough out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville lost at home to Eastern last season (64-50) as Tate toasted the squad for a team-high 16 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in 2021-22, Eastern lost at Plainville 49-30 in the Lancers’ opener back on December 16, 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, during the abbreviated pandemic campaign, the Kingstreeters dropped a tough 60-56 decision to the Blue Devils in overtime back on February 17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this Eastern program is experienced, knows how to win the close game and knows what it takes to pull out victory from the clutches of defeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect more of the same this year as the season moves along for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This place has always been tough for us,” said Ray of the Plainville gymnasium. “They play with great energy in this gym. We were not a good road team back in the day and now we’re starting to learn to prepare a little bit better, understand environments and, again, making the big play when the other team [is surging].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That run stopping basket or that run stopping defense stop, that’s the key to victory.”</p>
