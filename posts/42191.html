<p>The Bristol Eastern boys basketball team used a dominant second half performance to break open a tight contest with Pomperaug, outscoring their opponents by twenty and pulling away for a rousing 66-49 victory Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Eastern, trailing at the half 31-28, came out on fire in the third quarter and&nbsp; outscored Pomperaug 18-4 to take a 46-35 lead after three.</p>

<p>The Lancers received contributions from seemingly everyone on the floor in the third stanza. Zaveyn Tate (6 points), Jordan Chisholm (5), Lukas Sward (4), and Brayden Dauphinais (3)) all chipped in on the offensive end. And Eastern stepped up their defensive intensity and controlled the boards throughout the period.</p>

<p>Eastern's offense continued to hum in the 4th, highlighted by three 3’s from Chisholm, who tallied six treys in the game and led the Lancers with 22 points. Tate had 15 and both Sward and Dauphinais scored 12, as Eastern’s balanced attack was difficult for Pomperaug to defend.</p>

<p>The Lancers now advance to the Division IV quarterfinals and will face the #3 seed in the tournament, Innovation, in a game to be played Friday night at 7:00 at Goodwin Tech in New Britain.</p>
