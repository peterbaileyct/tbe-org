<p> 73 with clouds part of the time. The other part of the time no one knows. It's a big secret. Shhh. </p>

<p>Critics believe that if Trump were elected, he would not be tough against foreign governments. As a result, Trump recently announced that if he wins, he will immediately impose sanctions on the Hundred Acre Wood.</p>

<p>Polls show that half the country thinks President Biden stole the 2020 election.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, plans are underway for a Biden presidential library.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the books in it will be stolen from other presidential libraries.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The latest GMB poll</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latest GMB poll of Bristol voters shows that those who own a truck and a cat and enjoy Chicken Pot Pies are voting for Trump in record numbers. Substitute&nbsp;quiche and any French tart for Chicken Pot Pies and the vote brakes for Harris by a wide margin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump leads among hackers and white voters with facial hair over 60 who think his wife is hot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris leads among blacks and whites that wear progressive lenses, young voters, and people who exclusively gave out Kit Kat bars on Halloween.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The candidates are tied among South Pacific Islanders, New York Islanders fans, and people who hate the Terminator reboot.</p>
