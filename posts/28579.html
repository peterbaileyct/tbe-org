<p>Members of the business community and elected officials came together to celebrate the Bristol Bazaar's grand opening with a ribbon cutting ceremony this past Saturday. TBE thought it might be fun to learn about some of the makers and crafters at the indoor makers market located off Race Street. (For more on the Bristol Bazaar, see the article by The Edition's Laura Bailey. Click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.bristoledition.org/blog/2023/07/06/the-bristol-bazaar-provides-unique-setting-for-retail-and-art/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the moment, there are 24 crafters selling their wares at the Bristol Bazaar, the brainchild of local small business owners, Care and Eric Verikas, who brought the idea to life with a $235,000 grant from American Rescue Plan funds. The space will be able to support up to 40 artisans. It is also the site of a coffee lounge and classroom/event space.</p>

<p>Saige Hall hails from Southington where she has resided for the past 11 years, is raising her children and is a paraeducator. She is originally from Denver, Colo. She got the idea for the business from visiting out West and thought that making permanent jewelry is super cool. She said it brings out the creative side in her.</p>

<p>"It's where you come and pick your chain. It's sterling silver or 14 carat gold filled jewelry, chains. And you pick if you want a charm or if you just want a chain and then I weld it to [to fit] your wrist for a bracelet or you can do necklaces, anklets. I do rings, kind of anything you can imagine."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has been selling her work for about six months. She does holiday parties and has worked holiday bazaars for schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"My hopes for the Bristol Bazaar are that it can showcase everybody's creativity, give people a space to show off their work and just to celebrate small businesses."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wayne Malicki of Salem Wood Shop</h3>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wayner Malicki hails from Naugatuck where he has lived for the past 40 years, something that he had intended before he arrived all those years ago. Now, he is a fixture, as a regular participant on city boards and other city activities. He found out about the Bristol Bazaar while scrolling online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I was on Facebook. It was back between Christmas and New Year's. I saw a small post that Care put up. Contacted her. When I came here back then there was no sheet rock on the walls. Thought about it and said, "No." Thought about it some more, and came back, and it was one of the best things I've ever done."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started Salem Wood Shop in 2017. He had built and refinished furniture for 30 years. Took a hiatus and basically watched his grandkids. When they were out of school, he said, he decided he wanted to do something with wood working but did not want to have to lug great big pieces of wood. Sign making turned out to be the next best idea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he really hasn't had any other connection with Bristol, except to go to Lake Compounce as a kid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malicki said his hopes for the Bristol Bazaar is that Verikases expand it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I realize we are only two weeks into it. The results so far have been fantastic. Care and Eric have been great to work with. They place such attention to detail. You can see it in the sales."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from his presence at Bristol Bazaar, Malicki and Salem Wood Shop can be reached online at salemwoodshop.com.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeff Tedesco of La Familia Tedesco is from Bristol but has an eatery in Waterbury. Coincidentally, Tedesco and I used to hang around at the then Bristol Boys Club and sparred with each other under the tutelage of Pat Dyer and for a short time my dad. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tedesco makes confections, including his own chocolate, bean to bar chocolate, he called it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"My entire life I have my hand in cooking food one way or another. I have always enjoyed doing candies, always enjoyed baking," he said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired last July. Years ago, he said he was involved in baking but had been out of it for a long time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"So when I retired, I always wanted to open up my own shop."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tedesco is a Bristol Central High alum and a Bristol resident. His parents, Austin and the late Bunny Tedesco were friends of my own parents, who have since passed. Austin was involved with the Federal Hill Association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for the Bristol Bazaar, he said he thinks it a great attraction for downtown Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think that Care and Eric have done a phenomenal job putting this thing together. I think it's going to do really well for Bristol."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>La Familia Tedesco has a Facebook Page with more information about its products.</p>
