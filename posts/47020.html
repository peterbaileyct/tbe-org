<p>"We hope that these RAI systems can help children in the Bristol community and be another positive legacy of these beloved individuals.&nbsp; This is a small gesture, but it is one that we can uniquely provide," stated Timothy Gifford, founder of Movia.</p>

<p>As a small business here in Bristol, Movia has shared in the losses to the community.&nbsp; First among them is the tragic loss of young Nicholas Parenti who succumbed to a fast-moving brain tumor in August 2022.&nbsp; This was a personal loss at Movia, as Rob Parenti, who worked with us for several years, brought his whole family on board to help us in our mission to support special ability learners through Robot-Assisted Instruction.&nbsp; Margo Parenti and their two boys, Alex and Nick, were often in the office helping out.&nbsp; Nick's light and happy energy are still felt in our headquarters on Federal Hill.&nbsp; We miss Nick so much.</p>

<p>Then there was the unfathomable ambush of our finest first responders that led to the death of the two exceptional officers, Lt. Dustin DeMonte and Sgt. Alex Hamzy.&nbsp; Although we did not have the privilege to know Lt. Dustin DeMonte and Sgt. Alex Hamzy personally, we honor their presence in the community and feel the loss to the Bristol Police Department and those who knew and loved them.</p>

<p>We would like to honor these members of the community by donating the use of our Robot Assisted Instruction (RAI) systems to the community in their name.</p>

<p>"We are grateful for Movia's generous donation and their mission to support students who require special services here in Bristol in a new, fun, and engaging way," stated Amy Martino, Director of Special Services of the Bristol Public Schools.</p>
