<p>The latest 19U Connecticut American Legion Baseball poll is out, representing teams from all around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the locals from Bristol did not crack the top-10, Post 2 isn’t far off the mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight of the 10 squads in the current poll have yet to taste defeat in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, RCP – always one of the elite programs in Connecticut – is the top ranked team in the state at 7-0 followed by Middletown (6-0) in second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stamford came in at No. 3 (6-0) with Danbury (fourth, 4-0) and West Haven (fifth, 4-0) seizing the next two spots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ellington was the first team in the poll that was ranked with a loss (sixth, 6-1) while Waterford is ranked seventh at a perfect 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 1 competitor West Hartford (3-0) hangs in eighth place, North Haven is ninth (4-0) , and Westport is rated 10<sup>th</sup> (4-1) to round out the top-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is currently 3-3 overall (3-2 in Zone 1 play) and slated to compete against Simsbury on Wednesday at 5:45 p.m. in a Zone 1 tilt – weathering permitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Going for a Cruz</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the pitching rotation holds up, Bristol could be turning to Roberto Cruz on the mound against Post 84 tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz is currently 2-0 overall and last helped Post 2 to a win on Friday, spinning Simsbury by a 11-7 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is eligible to pitch tonight if the weather allows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only Bristol pitcher not eligible to throw is Matt Beaucar (1-2) who earned his first victory of the year on Saturday in Post 2’s 7-2 victory in Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just three hits to tally a badly needed win – Bristol’s second in a row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar, due to pitch count limitations, would be available to throw starting on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post has a scheduled doubleheader on Sunday against Torrington – starting at 1 p.m. from Muzzy Field in Bristol – and will probably be pressed into duty then.</p>
