<p>Juneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and U.S. General Gordon Granger stood on Texas soil and read General Orders No. 3: “The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This occurred two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, and over two months after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union Gen. Ulysses S Grant at the Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.</p>

<p>The Juneteenth, or Juneteenth National Independence Day, became an official federal holiday on June 17, 2021, and it not only honors African American freedom and achievements, it encourages self-development and respect for all cultures.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
