<p>For Brad Bonar Jr. the realization came when he was 54 years old and recently hospitalized for suicidal ideation--he'd been thinking about whether life was worth living since he was 12, he said--a serious situation which he had hidden--until he started looking for answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After talking with friends, among them health professionals, Bonar decided on a unique path to healing--he founded the comedy group, 1 Degree of Separation--which addresses depression and suicide in its "A Funny Look at Depression and Suicide," which came to the Rockwell Theater last Saturday on a bitterly cold night.</p>

<p>Bonar, who performed and emceed the evening was joined by several area comics, Stacy, Rodney and Jay, who shared their own stories in individual standup routines. Often, the routines included deep dark moments that, through comedic storytelling and terrific timing, brought both recognition of the seriousness of the subject and healing laughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After their individual standup routines, the four held a discussion around five questions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<li>What does your depression feel like?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What do others do that make it worse?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What do others do that make it better?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What do you do that makes it worse?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>What do you do that makes it better?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, as an example of the type of territory covered, Stacy was sharing her experience with recovery via a 12-step program, when Bonar, interrupted to say that he highly recommended these programs.</p>

<p>In fact, he said, if you haven't been through a program, you should get addicted to something so that you could attend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Have a lot of money?" he said. "Take up gambling."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: Not something to be taken literally, of course, but something to laugh about, together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the discussion, Bonar invited representatives from area health providers to the stage to introduce themselves. Audience members were then directed, if they chose, to get more information about mental health services at tables setup throughout the lower floor of the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The free program was one in a series of community-wide conversations sponsored by the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services in cooperation with its Downtown Live productions. </p>
