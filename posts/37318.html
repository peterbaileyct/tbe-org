<p>The following is the written text of Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano’s second inaugural address delivered on the evening of Monday, Nov. 13, at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to the Rockwell Theater. It is an honor to be in this newly remodeled theatre! Thank you to the staff here for pulling this event together and to Kirsten, Dave, and Dawn, who did most of the work behind the scenes to allow us to gather and celebrate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congratulations to all of our elected officials. It is hard to believe that we are doing this again in 2 short years . . .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you all enjoyed as much as I did hearing “Homegrown” as we came in again this year. It still rings true . . .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I got some good friends that live down the street,<br>Got a good lookin’ woman with her arms ‘round me,<br>Live in a small town where it feels like home,<br>I’ve got everything I need, and nothin’ that I don’t.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol voters spoke very clearly that they are happy with the current direction of this big small town. In another historic election year, Republicans took ALL possible seats, which this year includes a new treasurer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did we sweep? . . . We listened to those that did not vote for us two years ago and we picked up many new voters because we engaged people locally. We will continue to focus on good governance for ALL the residents of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years ago, I noted the historic change in leadership that spoke volumes about people not feeling like they had a voice . . . something that I think we changed emphatically. We have seen plenty of open debate, public participation, a Council that thinks for itself, and several new tools like ClearGov (our new online Budget Book) which is an online budget book which allows all city residents to have knowledge of the work of its government. We have 8,700 followers on our Facebook Page . . . and maybe we can add a few more tonight. (Mayor’s Office Bristol CT) . . . By the way if you are not on Facebook, you can follow us on LinkedIn, or Instagram.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, many more residents understand what is going on and I continue to encourage all to get involved in local government regardless of political party. (We have minority representation and most of our boards and commissions, and I assure you, it’s very hard to get people to serve so I do have an open door policy.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2023, Bristol voters reacted to our team demonstrating accountability for the basics in local government. We focused on Education, Public Safety and Public Infrastructure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We invested appropriately in our schools and increased our police force in the face of tragedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our greatest accomplishment however was reversing a 3 generation trend of stagnation downtown, since the beginning of Urban Renewal in 1961.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our 2021 election theme was “Building a Better Bristol,” where I stated that Bristol is an “All Heart City that is missing its soul.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now downtown is being rebuilt . . .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol WORKS! and Bristol Bazaar, were both started and completed in less than two years through the innovative ARPA Grant program . . . Yellow King is slated to open next month in the Bristol Bazaar . . . KindCare and City Hall were stated by the previous administration and completed by my administration. I am proud that we saved the Wheeler Health project by offering a questioning council alternatives that made the project much better as we crafted an agreement to share parking, reduce the size of the lot, and move the parcel. Ultimately, this created one more acre of developable land, which is the ONLY acre of the 18-acre Center Mall parcel left to be sold to a developer. Additionally, the brand NEW Hope Street Parking Garage is slated to be built next year, and the ByCarrier mixed use project, will add the first new “Live” component downtown and new “Play” options with first floor retail including 4 dedicated restaurant spaces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in Center Square, we have a new developer, PKL Enterprises from Providence, who was just approved to build a mixed-use building with 4 Work/Live spaces on the first floor facing Main Street with a total of 30 apartments on Parcel 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a handful of other projects that are in the planning stages and the heart of our city is beating again. The main focus of the work over the next two years will be to add many more new “city dwellers” in and around Centre Square to reach our goal of 3000 new residents. This smart growth of our population will support the downtown without taxing our resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leadership is hard to define in words, but action and results speak volumes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pln to continue to be a leader with grace and dignity even when those that disagree are disagreeable. I will listen to many points of view and make decisions that are best for the City of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WE will lead and finish what we have endeavored to create . . . Our administration HAS a plan for a vibrant Live, Work and Play environment downtown, in the West End, and that momentum will continue throughout the rest of the CITY. Yes, we are finally growing positively. Bristol is our hometown, and I am honored to be working for all my friends down the street, and all the citizens of this big small town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sincere thanks to the woman with her arms round me as well as my entire family and friends that allow me to give back to this city every day!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your support Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>God Bless Bristol . . . and God Bless America!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
