<p>I came across Shaun Casey, who was with his wife, Lucy, and this was at St. Joseph’s Cemetery last week. Shawn, who operates a gravestone restoration business, was doing so for the last time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shaun and I go back to high school at Bristol Eastern, where I was a year ahead of him in those Stone Age times. Shawn was always the gentleman, and it made my day in catching up with him after about two years.</p>

<p><strong>Two UConn players</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of us are following Bristol’s Donovan Clingan with the UConn men’s basketball team, national division one champions last season. In addition to Donovan, there’s another Bristol sophomore with the team, and that’s Andre Jackson, Jr.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andre, a sophomore Bristol native, played prep school ball in the state and many of us hadn’t heard of him. He became a preferred walk-on at UConn, and is on the team roster, having made a few brief game appearances.</p>

<p><strong>Notable on TV</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my last column, my initial one for this on-line enterprise, listed the names of folks from Bristol that I had seen on television recently. Add another, and that’s Steve Pikiell, head men’s basketball coach at Rutgers. </p>

<p><strong>The Savino family</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve known the Anthony Savino family for some years, starting with Tony, who left us in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I dealt with Tony through the local military community and the Tramps, a longtime sports committee he headed up of before his passing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His widow, Deanne is a wonderful lady, and their children are Anthony, Jr. and Cathy. Each is known for their endeavors, too. Anthony, Jr. is married to Rebecca and they have two daughters, Elise and Olivia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are quite a few people that I have thanked or need to, and those receiving my best today are Hailey and Josh Nelson, and Carolyn and Timothy Perkins.   </p>

<p><strong>A brief history about Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The area we now know as Bristol, Conn. -- and that includes Forestville and other old-time districts, was once a part of Farmington, Conn., which also took in other towns on its perimeters. Bristol broke away in 1785, known as New Cambridge, and included the boundaries of what are Bristol and Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Burlington would separate in 1806, and in 1911, Bristol changed to a city form of government from a borough type. The greater population resided near the center of what is known as downtown.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
