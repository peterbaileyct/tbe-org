Some of her favorite weekends were spent sifting through old pictures and turning them into beautiful pages and books that takes you on a journey down memory lane. She was a lover of Disney and enjoyed taking trips to Florida to experience the magic with her family. She was an animal lover and her cats were always more than just pets to her, loving them fiercely.</p>
