<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Blues of the New England Collegiate Baseball League have made an improbable run to the championship round this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After posting an 18-18-1 ledger near the end of the regular season, the Blues have won seven of its past eight games to represent the Western Division in the title tilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday night, with Bristol leading its series against the Sanford Mariners 1-0, the Blues qualified for the championship with a 4-2 come-from-behind victory from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re going to the championship,” said the Blues Twitter feed. “A 4-2 win over Sanford means we will play the for it all against the winner of the Newport/Danbury series!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That wasn’t exactly a given on July 28 when the Blues’ postseason future wasn’t so bright.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Bristol needed to win its final game, plus have a little luck along the way, in order to have a shot at the Fay Vincent, Sr. Cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s six run triumph at the Valley Blue Sox – coupled with some critical losses around the NECBL – meant that the Blues had a pulse going into the playoffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re in,” said the Blues’ Twitter feed. “A 10-4 win at the Valley Blue Sox and some help around the league means we are going back to the playoffs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after an epic opening loss to the Valley Blue Sox on July 31, putting Bristol behind the eight ball in its best-of-three series, the locals have not lost since – going a slick 4-0 the rest of the way and now are on the doorstep of a NECBL Championship and the cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at Bristol’s march through the quarterfinals as Bristol came from behind to steal the series away from Valley:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Game 2 – Bristol Blues 5, Valley Blue Sox 0 – Tuesday, August 1&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*In an amazing performance, former Bristol Eastern standout Jagger Duquette put together an amazing complete game shutout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette, posting a two-hitter, absolutely blitzed Valley’s batting order from start to finish – leading the Blues to a 5-0 triumph from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win tied the series up at 1-1 as Duquette was nearly untouchable that evening in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette fanned seven while walking just two as baserunners were at a premium with the stud dealing from the mound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valley stranded three runners on base but none of those athletes were in a good position to score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Connor Goodman (double, run scored), Selinsky (triple, RBI), Darius Troche and Cal Parrillo all roped out two hits apiece for Bristol while Tyler Fote (double, run, walk) added the other hit for the victors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues roped up 11 total hits as nine different players added something to the till.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively for Bristol, the squad roped up six extra base hits to score early and often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jordan Payton (2-for-5), West Hartford’s Dan Hussey, Parrillo (2-for-3) and Goodman all tallied doubles while Griffin Arnone and Joey Rios each smoked out triples to lead the Bristol contingent at the dish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
