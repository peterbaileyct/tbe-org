<p>Come Sunday morning, Hurricane Lee will have left New England behind, and even though the hurricane skirted Connecticut, we did get some terrific winds Friday. It was earlier in the week when the skies opened for two consecutive days bringing a drenching rain both times, and on the second day, flooding to the intersection of Routes 229 and 72.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Weather is weather, and unless you have to stand out in the rain to catch a school bus, it’s a matter of watching from behind a window or security of a porch as nature has its way—and nature is going to have its way.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around town and post Labor Day with an election in November candidates and town committees have their campaigns in full swing. Both the RTC and DTC had grand openings for their headquarters. The RTC is on Main Street in the store front where the Bristol Press had its offices. The DTC is located in Northside Square at the corner of North Main and Farmington Avenue in the former location of RiteAid. </p>

<p>Both parties are always looking for more volunteers, so if you are inclined stop by and find out how you can help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding voter registration, the registrar of voters is located temporarily at the old Webster Bank building on the corner of Riverside Avenue and Main Street, while Bristol City Hall is undergoing renovations. The office may be back at city hall sometime during October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online voter registration is available 24/7 at <a href="https://voterregistration.ct.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://voterregistration.ct.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week focuses on democracy, something I think about constantly. This time around it’s Sean Illing and the Gray Area podcast, entitled, “Democracy’s Existential Crisis,” featuring the author Astra Taylor, who has a new book out, “The Age of Insecurity: Coming Together as Things Fall Apart.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is just so much history in this piece that needs to be listened to and discussed because, as people who live in a democracy, we need to have an idea about the dynamics at work. This book might make a good book club subject. Either way, the podcast helps orient us so that we can take a step back from all the constant demands being placed on us ordinary people and perhaps regain some sense of personal agency.

<p>As for reading, I’ve picked up an old book on creativity, “Walking in the World: The Practical Art of Creativity,” by Julia Cameron. Cameron is famous for her 12-step book for creatives, called “The Artist’s Way.” It's an old book but it retains its freshness and I'm finding it both instructive and an inspiration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Walking in the World" proposes three “ways” to keep that creative spark going, the first two taken up earlier in "The Artist's Way": writing three pages in long-hand, preferably, every morning; making an artist date once a week; and getting out at least once a week for a walk. The book has exercises and right from the beginning, asks for a commitment in the form of a contract that you sign with yourself.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
