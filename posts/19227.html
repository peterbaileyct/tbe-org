<p>Robert “Bob” Allen Heister passed away unexpectedly at home the evening of Oct.  26. He was born Jan. 25, 1951 in Elgin, Ill., to Alfred and Mildred Heister. He graduated from Elgin High School and was educated at Northern Illinois University. A Midwesterner at heart, Bob spent his life living between various locations in Illinois, Logan, Utah and finally Bristol, Conn. </p>

<p>After five years of courtship Bob finally convinced the love of his life, Carla Fisher, to marry on Aug. 2, 1980, embarking upon a continued lifetime of love and happiness together. While he had a long history of working in academics and as a book editor, his real life’s work and joy was manifest in his two daughters, Leah Elizabeth and Ellen Clare, who will carry on his legacy. </p>

<p>He was ecstatic to become a grandfather in January, 2021, to granddaughter, Quinn Carlyle Burton, who shares an affinity for books and animals like her grandfather. His great passions in life outside of his family were literature, music and the family’s four-legged friends. He rescued countless animals throughout his lifetime and was a voracious reader. As a former percussionist, he had a deep appreciation and knowledge of jazz.</p>
