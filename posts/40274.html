<p>It could get a little slippery this morning. Snow is likely, about 2-4 inches with a chance of some freezing rain in the afternoon. The high will be about 29 with winds 5-10 m.p.h.</p>

<p>With a forecast like that, watch for the no-school announcements, and if we get 4 inches of snow (the modern definition of blizzard), schools may be closed for the rest of the week.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final episode of Bonanza aired on NBC in 1973. Bonanza was rated the 43rd greatest TV series by "T.V. Guide Magazine." Many observers of The Bristol Edition have mentioned that TBE’s Dave Fortier reminds them of Ben Cartwright, while others have noticed the uncanny resemblance of Ben’s son Hoss and TBE’s own Rit Carter.</p>

<p>On this day in 1899, the infamous gangster Al Capone was born. Capone was actually mentioned just yesterday by former President Donald Trump. Trump “bragged” that he was indicted multiple times, but Capone only had one indictment. What a slacker!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
