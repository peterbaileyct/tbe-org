<p>Public Works has opened enrollment for additional trash barrels and offers several methods for payment, it was announced earlier this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collection period for the barrels is from Jan. 1, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2024. The release recommends acquiring new barrels as soon as possible, since the $155 per barrel per calendar year, is not pro-rated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residential properties of one to five units are provided one rubbish barrel and one recycle barrel per unit.  For example, two-family homes have two rubbish barrels, five-unit homes have five rubbish barrels. Any additional rubbish barrels are $155 per barrel for the calendar year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any additional rubbish barrel will be emptied weekly, on your regular rubbish day.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
