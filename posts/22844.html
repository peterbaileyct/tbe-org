<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Central boys basketball team fell behind early in its CCC South encounter against Lewis Mills on Tuesday night, eventually absorbing a tough 75-60 loss from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>

<p>The Spartans (12-4 overall) earned a sweep over the Bristol schools after Mills squeaked by Bristol Eastern (49-48) the previous Saturday.</p>

<p>Mills dropped 21 points over first quarter play against Central (5-11 overall) and upped its advantage a bit over the following stanza.</p>

<p>Connor McAtee hit three 3-pointers on his way to 21 points while Eli Pelletier roped up 17 to lead the visiting aggression.</p>

<p>The Rams, having lost six straight by the completion of the showdown, saw sophomore shooting guard Carmelo Thompson pop off for a new career high in points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He canned 23 points, dropping in four three-pointers along the way, to lead all scorers that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense-minded Mike Allan dropped in 10 points, two off his career best, while Joey Pikiell hit three 3s on his way to 11 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey McMahon and Jayden Sokolowski each added five points while Jayeson VanBeveren notched four for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lopez also added a hoop but Central was limited to just 20 points by the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans roped up a 21-12 lead through eight minutes while outscoring the Bristol contingent 22-8 over the second stanza to scoop up a 43-20 edge at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams netted 15 points over third period play while Central won the final period 25-17 but ended up on the wrong side of a 75-60 final.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has four games left to play in the regular season this year.</p>

<p>This Thursday, the Rams travel to Berlin for a CCC South bout and on February 14, Central battles against an extremely aggressive squad from Conard in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are home for Middletown on February 17 for senior night and the following Monday, it’s Central/Eastern Part II in what should be a great back-and-forth affair from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at BEHS (6 p.m. start time).</p>
