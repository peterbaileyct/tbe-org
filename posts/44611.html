<p>Since Roy was moved to middie the ground ball advantage has been clearly on the Lancers side. Her toughness and quickness all over the field have been a big difference for Eastern. </p>

<p>The defense was anchored by three seniors, Meg Krok, Jayna Hatcher and Gabby McLay. Krok has been locking down the opponents all season while Hatcher's checks and clearances allows the Lancers to gain possession. </p>
