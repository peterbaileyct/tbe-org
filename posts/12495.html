<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League is looking for big things for the upcoming 2022 campaign. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year marks to 93<sup>rd</sup> year of GHTBL play and if the pandemic doesn’t flare up during the summer months, expect the league to hold a full slate of games for the first time since 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This season, the GHTBL will go back to its traditional format,” according to the GHTBL website. “Each franchise will play three games against every other franchise. The 24-game schedule will be the most regular season games planned by the league since 2019. Things are finally back to normal for the time being.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, almost back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be a bit of a change for the franchise from the Mum City as the Bristol Greeners, entering its second season in the GHTBL play, will have a different manager in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Mays is new coach of the Greeners, replacing long time manager AJ Lorenzetti.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays played at Bristol Eastern and helped the Bristol American Legion junior baseball program to a New England championship over his playing career.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitcher has a ton of experience and looks forward to adding a managerial component along with his playing abilities this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL will have nine franchises return to play this year: The Bristol Greeners, East Hartford Jets, Hartford Colts, M&amp;T People’s, Rainbow Graphics, Record-Journal Expos, South Windsor Phillies, Wallingford Cardinals, and a long-time member of the GHTBL, the Vernon Orioles. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, since nine teams will be competing this year, the GHTBL postseason tournament will include a ‘play-in’ game - pitting the eighth and ninth place finishers against each other in a single-elimination showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, an eight-team double-elimination tournament will commence that ‘play-in’ game. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for the players, over two-hundred athletes are expected to compete this summer in the GHTBL and plenty of returners - along with several newcomers - will be looking to seize both the regular season and postseason championships. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league expects players to travel from as far as Groton and Longmeadow, Massachusetts to contend for a GHTBL championship in 2022 - pitting athletes of various abilities on the baseball diamond. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A vast majority of GHTBL players are also current or former college players,” said the website. “A handful are ex-professionals. A few are high school prospects. They join the twilight-loop for various reasons [whether it’s] to develop into a better player, for the love of the game, [or] camaraderie with teammates. Whatever the reason, the GHTBL is grateful to remain one of most talent laden summer leagues in Connecticut.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league is extremely competitive and provides excellent family entertainment across all its platforms and games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, the GHTBL uses wood bats, abides by Major League Baseball rules, and competes over a seven-inning format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Bristol Greeners starts play on May 23 </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Greeners opens the 2022 campaign on Monday, May 23 against the South Windsor Phillies from Rotary Field. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season was the Greeners’ first in the GHTBL after a long association with the Connecticut Tri-State Baseball League. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joining the GHTBL meant a little less travel for the players on the Greeners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trips to places like Torrington and Bethlehem after work never allowed it a full complement of players to travel on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the GHTBL includes venues closer for the players from the Bristol franchise to compete within the Central Connecticut area.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muzzy Field will once again be the home field for the Greeners this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The regular season for the Greeners lasts into the final day of July with the playoffs quickly commencing in August.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The last Bristol franchise in the GHTBL</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Previously, the Bristol Merchants (2001-11) were a staple of GHTBL wars and the Greeners hope to eventually match some of those feats of the last Bristol franchise to play in the league.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Bunty Ray was the manager of the program from 2002 until 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray helped the team to back-to-back regular season titles in 2009-10 while the program won the playoff championship in 2009.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all, the program collected nine total titles under the watchful eye of Ray and a very talented roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Opening Day&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season’s Opening Day will be held at Mount Nebo Park in Manchester on Sunday, May 22.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vernon Orioles will square off against Rainbow Graphics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
