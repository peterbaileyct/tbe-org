<p>The Eastern boys basketball team took off from the opening tip, dominating Capital Prep in all areas of the game, and coasted to an 80-44 victory Monday night in the Lancer’s gym. Eastern led, 23-7, after one quarter, and Capital Prep never recovered. Zaveyn Tate scored eight, Lukas Sward six, and Jordan Chisholm five in a first period played seemingly without a ref’s whistle being heard. The Lancers drove at will through the Prep defense and scored lay-up after lay-up.</p>

<p>Coach Bunty Ray took advantage of the mismatch by playing his entire roster in the second half, mixing up the different groups on the court every few minutes. The JV group also got some valuable tournament experience in the final minutes.</p>

<p>Tate led all Lancer scorers with 17 points, followed closely by Chisholm with 15 and Sward with 12. Twelve Eastern players dented the scoring column on the night and a good time was had by all.</p>
