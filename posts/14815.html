<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Eastern standouts will take part of the 2022 Connecticut American Legion Baseball College Prospect Showcase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Central Connecticut State University in New Britain is hosting the event and the players from the Bristol American Legion squad will play for the Nation Team that morning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showcase, from Balf-Savin Field at CCSU, is a great way for scholastic players to get a little attention as several collegiate coaches and scouts will be on hand for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice for the contest will commence at 9 p.m. and approximately one hour later, the game will begin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf and Maglio helped lead the Bristol Eastern baseball team to the Class L Tournament this past spring and have been tremendous for Post 2’s Junior Legion program this year, currently sitting at 9-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf won two games for the Kingstreeters, carrying an ERA of 3.78 while Maglio went 3-4 with 37 strikeouts and a 4.20 ERA.</p>

<p>Maglio nearly batted .260 for Eastern with 15 hits and seven RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo might even be pressed into duty on Tuesday evening as the Juniors have a showdown at RCP or could be in the line-up for the Seniors in Zone 1 battle action West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
