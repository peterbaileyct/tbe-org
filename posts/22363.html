<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. - The Pace Women’s Basketball team fell behind by 18 points against Southern New Hampshire University on Saturday afternoon before the Setters and former Bristol Eastern sharpshooter Ciara Collins put tougher a huge run to nearly seize the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Penmen’s edge was chopped to one with seconds remaining but the squad hit late free throws to push the lead out as SHNU scooped up a 77-74 win from the Stan Spirou Field House in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pace (8-13 overall, 5-9 NE-10, 5-5 on the road) trailed 47-29 with 1:10 remaining in the second quarter, absorbing a sizable 49-34 deficit at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Collins netted eight points over the first 5:12 of the third quarter to make it a seven point game (54-47).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And late in the game, Collins found Mackenzie Kock (14 points) for a huge 3-point bomb and with 26 seconds remaining, the Setters were down just 75-74.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the ensuing play, Collins committed a foul on Adriana Timberlake - disqualifying herself in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The foul was a good one as Timberlake missed both throws with 22.4 seconds left but Pace was never able to draw even with a game-tying 3 - absorbing a tough three-point loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, I just think we obviously fought back and we catch ourselves in this situation a lot of times where we’re just crawling back from [being] down,” said Collins after the game. “I don’t know. It’s so hard because we come back and then there’s so much more energy and then, we have to [commit] a foul because we’re down and then they get even more ahead.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 74 points were the most Pace scored in a game this season but the squad was able to grab the lead for only 67 seconds which came off a 17-15 edge as Collins nabbed a huge offensive rebound to help her team get another hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol standout didn’t have her best shooting night, going 2-of-12 from the field and missing all four of her long range attempts, but Collins was active all over the court in other areas to give her squad a chance to steal the contest late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearly tallying a double-double, Collins went a perfect 8-of-8 from the free throw line on her way to 12 points while also snaring nine rebounds and two steals over 29 minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As usual, Collins started the game for the Setters but the Penmen shot out to a quick 7-0 cushion before the Pace went on a 17-8 burst to scoop up a 17-16 lead through 10 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SNHU (14-4 overall, 10-3 NE-10) went on a scoring spree in the second period, posting 33 points, to snare a 15-point bulge at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But to start the third quarter, Collins exploded a bit for the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She nabbed two offensive boards, eventually scoring on a scoop shot, and then drained two foul shots to trim the deficit to 51-43 with 7:24 to play in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quick breather, Collins came back in and sent down a midrange jumper and when her two charity tosses found the bottom of the net, the deficit was knocked to seven (54-47) with 4:48 to play in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An NBA range 3 by Koch got Pace within four with just over four minutes left in the third - capping a 13-3 run - but the Penmen woke back up a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins picked up her third foul seconds later and retreated to the bench and off a quarter ending 7-2 push, SNHU was up by nine at 61-52 with the fourth period on tap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The host squad never relented, Collins picked up her fourth foul with 3:27 left in the game but she was quickly reinserted into the mix - with Pace trailing 73-66.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An 8-2 Pace jaunt was highlighted by a Koch 3 off the Collins assist as the comeback was almost complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing 75-74 with 10.3 seconds left, Pace had control of the ball but a scrum led to a steal and seconds later, SHNU’s Jenna Roche dropped in two insurance free throw to make it a 77-74 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SHNU had fouls to waste late and used most of them up before one last ditch 3 by Lauren Hackett (14 points) just rimmed out as Pace dropped a heartbreaking three-point decision on the road, 77-74.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s hard to crawl back from when we’re down,” said Collins. “But we definitely made the effort which was good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>For the season, Collins has played in 20 of 21 games, making 18 starts along the way…She’s averaging 8.0 points and 3.5 rebounds-per-game… Collins has kicked in 11 three-pointers to date and remains a tremendous free throw shooter, dropping in 29-of-32 charity tosses for a slick 90.6-percent shooting clip.</p>
