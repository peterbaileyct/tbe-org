<h2>American Legion program Vietnam Day program moved from March 29 to a date to be determined</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vietnam Lapel Pin presentation along with a program honoring of the late former Mayor Art Ward has been delayed from March 29 until the display case where the items will be stored arrives, according to an email from the local American Legion Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>March 29 is when the state celebrates Vietnam Recognition Day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ward was the driving force behind finding a home for the items left at the Wall That Heals when it came to Bristol in 2016, according to Neal Supranovich. When the Wall left it did not have room to take the items with it, and American Legion Post 2 collected the items. A search for a place to call home. &nbsp;After a number of years and a few setbacks, one was found. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the items collected at the Wall in 2016 as well as in a previous visit, the display case will hold items honoring the 17 Bristolites who lost their life in the Vietnam War.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Before he passed, Ward began the fundraiser for the Vietnam program, intending to be the first to donate. The fundraiser continued with the first $100 donation in Ward's name, with the instructions that the donation would be in Ward's name. The donation was anonymous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that all other donations given were in Memory of Art Ward. The Korean Veterans Association covered the balance.</p>
