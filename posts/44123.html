<p>One of Rock &amp; Roll’s most iconic vocal groups is coming to Bristol this Saturday, when the Drifters will take the stage at the Rockwell Theater. </p>

<p>“We chose to bring the Drifters to Downtown Live because our city enjoys this era of music, and we love to see our patrons happy,” Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said.</p>

<p>The Drifters are an American doo-wop and R&amp;B group that formed in the mid 1950s, led by legendary vocalist Clyde McPhatter. The band experienced many lineup changes over the years, with lead tenors Ben E. King, Charlie Thomas, Bobby Hendricks and Johnny Moore fronting the group at different times between 1959 and 1972.</p>

<p>The soulful singing group charted 13&nbsp;<em>Billboard Hot 100</em>&nbsp;hits including “Up on the Roof,” “This Magic Moment,” “On Broadway,” and “Save the Last Dance for Me.” The Drifters were the first musical group to include string instruments into R&amp;B music with their number one hit, "There Goes My Baby," and their 1964 classic “Under the Boardwalk” ranks number 487 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.&nbsp; The Drifters were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 by Billy Joel. </p>

<p>“These performers are a class act, singing some of the best songs ever created,”&nbsp;Therriault said.&nbsp;“I think the audience will enjoy singing along and being in the moment.”</p>

<p>The upcoming performance from the American doo-wop and R&amp;B group has been highly anticipated by theater patrons, with 450 tickets already sold. Therriault stated that extra parking will be available behind the Bristol Arts and Ideas Magnet School, which houses the Rockwell Theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We suggest anyone who has difficulty walking long distances to be dropped off at the front entrance,”&nbsp;Therriault said.&nbsp;“We also encourage patrons to come to Bristol before the show to enjoy some delicious eateries in the area and stay and play around Bristol after for a night cap dessert or drink.”</p>

<p>The Drifters concert will be held Saturday, April 20, at 7 p.m. at the Rockwell Theater. Tickets are $40.&nbsp;</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
