<p>Bristol native and Bristol Central High School senior Camryn Patton was crowned Miss Connecticut’s Teen 2024 as a part of the Miss Connecticut's Teen and Miss Connecticut competitions at the Ridgefield Playhouse last Saturday, June 22.</p>

<p>Patton said she started clapping for the other finalist when the winner was announced, because she misheard and thought she was runner-up.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I don’t think it sank in until they had me face the audience and put the crown on my head,” she said.</p>

<p>Monica Fenwick of Watertown was crowned Miss Connecticut 2024.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton and Fenwick take the reins from their previous titleholders, Emily Anastacio (Teen) and Gina Carlota (Miss) and will now represent Connecticut by competing at the Miss America pageant in 2025.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Patton and Fenwick placed as first runners up in the 2023 competition at Mohegan Sun.</p>

<p>Patton started on the local pageant trail at 3-years old and has held the titles Petite Miss Forestville, Miss Southington Pre-Teen, Petite Miss Chrysanthemum, Miss Chrysanthemum and Miss Forestville’s Teen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A volunteer in many areas in Bristol over the years, Patton currently runs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, It’s-OK. The goal of It’s-OK is to bring mental health awareness to the forefront of the arts community and remind them that when they need a break, to take it.</p>

<p>As a part of her winnings, Camryn received a $1,500 college scholarship and is eligible to take advantage of a four-year grant to the University of Alabama, which has always been her dream school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fun fact, two of the last three Miss Connecticut Teens are Bristol residents, and the third, Emily Anastacio, although from Meriden, went to the pageant as Miss Bristol's Teen.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
