Their 7 years of dating consisted of many dates at Frankie's, movies, hiking, boating, lots of traveling, and more. They were married June 3, 1995.

<p>Dave was a master electrician for over 35 years. For the last 10 years, he was an integral part of Connecticut Spring and Stamping as a foreman electrician. He was known by his coworkers as always having an infectious smile and bringing a strong work ethic. Dave is and was a role model for his daughters, and the “best big brother ever,” as the oldest of 4. Dave was a kind, gentle, and fun-loving person who loved everyone in his life so dearly, including his newest furry best friend, Gracie.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
