<p>A long time ago in a city that still believed in fairy tales, this reporter informed the readers of TBE that a Dairy Queen was coming to Bristol. He did so with the innocence of an excited four-year old who still believed in the tooth fairy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The arrival was planned for a good-sized parcel on Route 6, sitting appropriately enough next to Kentucky Fried Chicken, or as they prefer these days, KFC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is the photo that hyped the new arrival.</p>

<p>Time passed, and then passed some more, and the lot was cleared but remained empty. We were told that the DQ was not dead, but there were some problems that needed to be worked out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More months went by, and the months turned into seasons, and the seasons turned into years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, sad to say, the DQ lot is for sale. DQ in Bristol is dead. Yes, Virginia, there is no Dairy Queen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What could go in that lot now? Many citizens think Bristol could use a good Vape shop. Or Dollar General could use another Bristol location. We eagerly await the next announcement.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What went wrong with DQ? We cannot say for certain, but our suspicion is that it was always intended as a cruel hoax on the innocent DQ lovers of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This embarrassed reporter has offered his resignation to the editor-in-chief of TBE, Dave Fortier, but Fortier slapped my letter away, shouting, “Why would I want the resignation of someone who isn’t even paid?!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here I sit, waiting for my next humiliation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wait, I just got a hot tip that a gas station will soon open on Route 6 near the Bingham School apartments! I’ll keep everyone posted.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
