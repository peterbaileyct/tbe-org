<p>The Community Investment Fund (CIF) is a statewide program that fosters economic development in historically underserved communities across the state, awarding up to $175 million each fiscal year to eligible municipalities. Bristol&nbsp;was awarded one of the larger CIF grants that will allow the city to enhance economic development and small business growth.</p>

<p>Rep. Mary Fortier, who served as a City Councilor from 2013 to 2021, said that the West End project has been something that city officials have been discussing for several years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you see what the place looks like now and then you see the pictures that the professionals create to show you what it could look like; these were the most transformative pictures I've ever seen in my time serving in government,” said Fortier. </p>

<p>“By trying to revitalize our downtown, making these streets beautiful again, it's going to go a long way for the businesses that are there. It’ll have other businesses looking at those vacant properties and saying this is an attractive place to set up my business.”</p>

<p>New development in the center of Bristol has expedited the need to improve roadways leading into downtown. Deputy Mayor Cheryl Thibeault said that she sees the Route 72 corridor improvements as an important part in the downtown revitalization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We recognize the heart is the small business,” said Thibeault. “Small businesses are what’s going to drive this town and now we have a way to connect them. With the new apartments going downtown with the Carrier Project, all those people and restaurants underneath; we can have a great thing going all the way down to the Sessions Building.”</p>
