<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - Bristol Central pitching stud Sophia Torreso has absolutely been dominating the softball scene for years now in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a 17-strikeout performance against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern on Thursday afternoon, she picked up an outstanding victory on senior day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That spectacular effort fueled the Rams to a 14-2 win over the Lancers from the softball field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest ended in the sixth inning via the mercy rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams finished the regular season at an excellent 19-1 overall while the Lancers were a credible 11-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso allowed just four hits and did not allow a free pass while retiring the last 16 batters she faced over another amazing outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s fantastic and I think her leadership skills are far superior to her physical abilities on the mound,” said Central coach Monica Hayes of Torreso. “That’s what I’m impressed with the most. The way that she picks her teammates up, leading them and just the example of what you want a student athlete to be.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m very impressed with her.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers brought energy and for the second time this season against Central, Eastern attacked early, getting a jump on Central during first inning play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored two quick runs thought just a half inning of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a coach, going up against one of the best pitchers in the state, you look to get on top 2-0 and then [hope] to hold that lead,” said Eastern coach Tyler Catlin. “It’s not going to be easy against a great line-up like Bristol Central though.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two away, Eastern’s Emily Valentine dropped in an infield bunt to third and then Ashley Serafin went yard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a 1-2 pitch, Serafin cracked a ball just over the fence in center, a huge, towering shot, to make it a 2-0 game with Central coming to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We delivered the first blow,” said Catlin. “That was a great hit by Ashley. Serafin caught some lightning in a bottle there. Emily [Valentine] got on there with a nice bunt single.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the first, Central was able to draw even off three hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Tori Hogan (2-for-5, two RBI) - taking advantage of extra playing time along with Emma Kulak (double, two runs) - smashed a deep-dish double that was just out of the reach of an outstretched Valentine in center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re just taking advantage of an opportunity,” said Hayes of Hogan and Kulak. “They created them for themselves with practice and the way they’ve been playing in JV and when they get into varsity games all year long. That was purposely done to give them experience throughout the year so the fact they’re taking advantage of their opportunities, I’m happy for them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And I’m not surprised in the least. That’s what life is all about, taking advantage of opportunities and I’m just so happy for them to come out here and have some fun and execute on top of it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Torreso (2-for-3, two RBI) singled Hogan in with a base hit to left, splitting the difference in the score, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorelei Stancavage (1-for-4, four RBI) reached on a fielder’s choice when the play at second base was not made, resulting in an error, while Lillian VanNostrand singled to center to load the bases up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a groundout to third base by Mya Porrini plated Torreso as the 2-2 stalemate was the score of the game as the second inning commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second, Torreso fanned the side and would do so again in three of the final four innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A groundout to Torreso by Kayla Webber to open the fifth was the only non-strikeout by the Central pitcher after first inning play over a major league effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pia is a phenomenal pitcher, holy cow,” said Catlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went for two more runs in the bottom of the second to snare a 4-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kulak reached via error, Dez Nickerson (1-for-2, two runs, three RBI) sacrificed her over to second base and Kaley Laird (4-for-5, two doubles, four runs scored, RBI) doubled to center to put two runners in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hogan then dropped in a sharp single to left, clearing the bases, as the two-RBI tally gave Central a two-run cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso was ultra quick in snaring three Ks in the third while Porrini dropped a Texas leaguer with one away in the bottom of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin pitched her way out of the jam but Eastern just couldn’t solve the riddle of Torreso as the deficit loomed big on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the completion of the fourth frame, all of Central’s putouts were via strikeouts, 10 in a row to that point of the&nbsp;game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Nickerson walked, stole second and came home to score on a Laird single to left, making it a 5-2 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hogan bunted Laird to second, took third on a passed ball and scored on a Stancavage bunt that wasn’t fielded as the RBI tally made it 6-2 through four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso gobbled up two more strikeouts, nabbing 14 in the game after five, as Central kept its four-run cushion intact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were sharp at the plate in the fifth with batters 7-8-9 due up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the frame, Abrianna Lubrico (2-for-4, run scored) snuck out a swallow hit to right and then Kulak bounced a ball of the fence in left-center to put runners on second and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Nickerson absolutely crushed a no-doubt homer over the left-field fence as the three-run shot pushed the deficit to 9-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I moved her around a little bit, dropped her down” in the lineup said Hayes of Nickerson. “She’s seeing a little bit more fastballs I think and she’s taking advantage. She’s using her speed the best way she can and I’m excited when she gets up to bat. You never know what’s going to happen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s really going to be great for Bristol Central in the next few years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird added an infield hit, Hogan reached on an error at shortstop and a single by Torreso scored Laird to give Central a 10-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Stancavage, with still no outs in the inning, sliced a sharp hit by the fielder in right as the race was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She hustled all the way home through Serafin made a great throw into the plate as the inside-the-park homer helped Central secure a 13-2 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breaking a streak of 12 straight strikeouts by Torreso in the sixth, Jaz Browne dropped a single into center to start the sixth for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso then rolled up K’s 15 through 17 as all but one out for Central was via strikeout by the All-state pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Central ended the game in the sixth stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird smacked a double with one away, advanced to third base on a grounder and off a wild pitch by Brooklyn Whitlock, the senior scooted home to tag the dish as Central ended the contest via the mercy rule, 14-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They showed some pride,” said Catlin of Eastern. “The goal is to show some pride when it was getting out of hand there at the end, tried not to get mercy ruled, stay in there, [and] stay engaged.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the seniors at Central, the foursome of Lorelei Stancavage, Kaley Laird, Adrianna Lubrico and Sophia Torreso all played in their final regular season home game, beating their rival 14-2 to close out at 19-1 as the postseason - namely the CCC Tournament - on deck.</p>
