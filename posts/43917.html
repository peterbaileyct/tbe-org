<p>An in-person meeting took place Tuesday, April 23, at Bristol Public Library. This gathering featured a charrette which is an interactive workshop that allows participants to collaborate with professionals, share ideas, and explore innovative solutions.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Naugatuck Valley Active Transportation Plan is to create a multi-modal framework that encourages and accommodates various forms of non-motorized transportation, including walking, rolling, cycling and other active modes, according to the release announcing the meeting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once completed, the plan will serve as a comprehensive roadmap to help guide future infrastructure investments that improve the access, comfort and safety of pedestrians and cyclists.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The NVCOG has released an online survey to examine habits, preferences, and challenges to walking/rolling and cycling in the community at <a href="https://arcg.is/yKyKW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://arcg.is/yKyKW</a>. Residents of the Naugatuck Valley planning region are strongly encouraged to participate.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
