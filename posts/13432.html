<p>After Foley retired the side in order to start the game, the Falcon offense scored 6 in the bottom of the frame. Devin Kulas led off with a single and came in to score the first run when Mario Izzo tripled to left. Casey Cerruto singled home Izzo and advanced to 3rd when the ball was misplayed in the outfield. Cerruto scored when Joey Tonnotti's long fly ball to center was dropped; Tonnotti took 3rd on the play. Then a throwing error on Steve Morelli's ground ball allowed Tonnotti to score making it 4-0. Morelli advanced to 3rd on Jamie Leggett's single, and came in to score on Jonathan Remillard's SAC fly to center. Cal Chance followed with a single. Then Kulas doubled driving in Leggett to make it 6-0. That would be all the cushion the Falcons needed.<br><br>St Paul added 1 in the bottom of the 2nd when Morelli tripled after Tonnotti walked, and that made it 7-0.<br></p>
