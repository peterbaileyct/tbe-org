<p>The sole run was scored in the bottom of the sixth inning. Pinch hitter Kyle Wilson beat out an infield single on a play that was very close at first. Keaton Kroll re-entered the game replacing Wilson on 1st, and advanced to 2nd on a passed ball. One out later, Leggett drove a single to left scoring Kroll, and St Paul took a 1-0 lead into the 7th.</p>
