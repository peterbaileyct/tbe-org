<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The New England Collegiate Baseball League postseason is upon us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the 2022 playoffs have the Bristol Blues in a prime-time position for a shot at the NECBL Championship, the Fay Vincent Cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three division winners, which included Bristol, are in the playoff mix, as well as three wild card teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By virtue of its outstanding 32-12 regular season record, the Blues earned the second seed and a bye into the semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vermont Mountaineers, also at 32-12, took home the top seed – getting a bye into the semifinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tie breaking criteria had Vermont take the number one seed in tournament play over Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an amazing regular season finish, both Bristol and Vermont tied the 2016 Newport Gulls for the most wins in NECBL regular season history at thirty-two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol and Vermont’s playoff opponents will be determined over a single-elimination wild card round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, seeds 3-6 will battle it out for a chance at a semifinal berth on Tuesday against one of the top programs in all the NECBL.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 3 Newport Gulls takes on No. 6 Sanford Mainers from Cardines Field in Newport, Rhode Island and in the bottom of the bracket, it’s the fourth ranked Martha Vineyard’s Sharks against No. 5 Mystic Schooners in a showdown from the Shark Tank in Martha’s Vineyard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wild card round is a single elimination event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mountaineers will battle the lowest remaining seed after the wild card round while the Blues square off against the other victor in the semifinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The semifinals (and the finals) will be best-of-three events, starting on Tuesday with the home team hosting game one and game three (if necessary).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All games during the postseason can be streamed live on the NECBL Broadcast Network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
