<p>Michael Mattioli, 59 of Bristol, passed away on Nov. 8, at home. Born on March 6, 1965, he was the son of Louis J. Mattioli and Marion Weber Mattioli. Mike Mattioli was one of a kind. He struggled with alcoholism most of his life, and the disease overtook him in most recent years. Before that, is how we will remember him.</p>

<p>Mike was frugal. Mike never wasted a penny, nickel or dime in the entirety of his life. If you were in his company, you did not waste. He was very proud of this fact, and it served him well. He brought it to his work as well as his home. He took pride in his work and enjoyed his longtime work at LJ’s, working for his favorite boss, Jim. He loved to cook, waste free of course, and was especially proud of his pasta fagioli. He made huge pots of this and would personally deliver portions to all his family. Mike loved music, all kinds, but mostly he loved rock and roll. He had extensive knowledge of artists, their history, their life stories. He also loved movies and prided himself on his thoughtful, detailed critique.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike was an uncle to many. His nieces and nephews regarded him as their favorite “cool” uncle Mike. He loved them, and they loved him. He turned his nephews on to his beloved hobby, playing disc golf. He assisted in establishing several very successful disc golf courses in his hometown of Bristol. His disc golf family was the highlight of his life. He talked incessantly about it, with great enthusiasm. They gave him a life he would not otherwise have had. We thank them all for that. His biggest love, by far, was for his only child, Tate. He was a very proud dad. Mike enjoyed the holidays with family when he could -- his Christmas gifts were always original and the talk of the day. (Remember the frugality.) Mike had a memory like no other. He could repeat, in detail, pretty much every day of his life. Which was quite astounding to all who knew him.</p>
