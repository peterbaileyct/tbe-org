<p>BRISTOL - After thrashing Windsor for its first victory of the season, what would the encore be for the Bristol Eastern softball against Lewis Mills on Tuesday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another resounding victory of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers needed just five innings to put away the Spartans, picking up a 22-0 victory from the softball field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to .500 over the winning endeavor while Mills fell to 1-2.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now at 2-2, Eastern has won back-to-back games and stays home this Friday for an out of conference attraction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pomperaug invades the famed Thunderdome at 4:15 p.m. as the Lancers look to go over .500 for the first time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be Pomperaug’s fifth game in seven days by the time the program reaches the Mum City.</p>
