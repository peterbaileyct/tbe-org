<p>There is much to learn from old burying grounds that date back to colonial and revolutionary times. And Saturday morning at The Bristol Public Library, Ruth Brown, the Founder and executive director of the Connecticut Gravestone Network spoke before a sparse crowd eager to learn about their significance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While providing a history of how cemeteries have changed, Brown also went through the process of how gravestones are cleaned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She provided images of gravestones that had been repaired and graveyards in disrepair while detailing their troubles.</p>

<p>While attendance was affected by the raw weather, it did not diminish the insightful presentation.</p>
