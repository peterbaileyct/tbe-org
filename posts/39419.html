<p>BRISTOL - For the second year in a row, the girls basketball program from Bristol Central gets its shot at the BC Holiday Classic title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams won it with relative ease in 2022, defeating Wolcott Tech 70-7 in the qualifying game and then blasted Gilbert 63-30 to seize the title victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Central battled pesky Platt to have the right to compete for another championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the locals did not disappoint, snaring a huge 69-25 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amazingly, Central - now on a two-game winning streak - took both its games against the programs from Meriden, Maloney and Platt, by scoring 69 points against each opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers, who were completely overwhelmed from start to finish, couldn’t slow down the charging Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Nicole Riemer blasted in a career-high 24 points while Arianna Rivera posted 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leilani Jackson and Myah Steiner each flashed in eight points but to get to the finals, the program is going to have to withstand all the elements against a solid Canton program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Canton (2-1) opened the season with a 49-34 loss at Suffield and has not played a home game to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High-scoring Avery Brown (23 points versus Gilbert) is a handful while Ruby Thenerge (13 points) and Ally Wire (eight) were able to overcome the high-scoring Emily Area (20 points for Gilbert).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Canton program will have its hands full agains the likes of Central’s Olivia Louis and Layman Cespedes on defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are looking for their third win in a row against an aggressive Canton program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central is certainly enjoying the spoils of their labors, looking forward to defend its holiday crown on Friday at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of our goals this year was to win this tournament,” said Riemer. “I think if we can continue to put in hard work and just play together, we can do this.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 5:30 which will follow the boys game against Capital Prep.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
