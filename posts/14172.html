<p>BRISTOL - The Central Connecticut Conference recently released its list of CCC South All-Conference performers and a large grouping of Bristol athletes, representing many of the spring sports, made the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scholastic teams from the public schools in town had various degrees of success with both the baseball, softball, and boys and girls lacrosse squads qualifying for postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In baseball, Central’s duo of Frank Spirito and J.T. Clark earned CCC South All-Conference honors while on King Street, Ben D’Amato - who never struck out in 2022 - and Jaydon Churchill took the same honors home for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed like Bristol’s public school squads in softball could have easily put over a dozen players on the CCC South All-conference team this season after the programs combined to win 35 total games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central - a Class LL finalist - saw the trio of Alex Sciarretto, Sophia Stancavage, and Lorelei Stancavage make the CCC South team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that crew, a talented core of junior standouts, will return in 2023 for an encore performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s softball squad made a mad dash to the Class L semifinals, losing to eventual state champion Mausk, as the senior battery of Janessa Gonzalez and Ali Tellier were both honored by the CCC.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three players from Bristol’s boy coop lacrosse team were selected for the 2022 All-Conference team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate Shorette, Chris Sirois, and Andrew Spina made the squad and on the flip side, eight players from the girls lacrosse teams in the Mum City were nominated as CCC South picks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s squad was tremendous this year, thanks to the group of CCC South All-Conference selections of Ava Bouchard, Emily Lowe, Alyah Rodriguez Warren, Rachel Wygant, and Maddy Secor - all putting together a tremendous season for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern also qualified for the states behind the outstanding play of Ciara Collins, Emma Stavens, and Vanessa Drury - all CCC South picks to boot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys golf, Central’s Scott Petrosky and Joey Pikiell were easy calls for the All-Conference squad in the South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky took home All-State honors while Pikiell netted a hole-in-one early in the campaign for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol boys tennis had three boys make the All-Conference squad which included Nathaniel Lund from Eastern and Beckett Hennessey and Carter Goodwin for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In girls tennis, three standouts from the Rams were All-Conference selections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grouping of Sam Chapman, Alexa Rinaldi, and Brooke Rinaldi earned honors for their play over the spring season as did Eastern senior Brooke Treannie - the top singles player for the Lancers’ young program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys track and field, Bristol Central cleaned up with eight athletes earning CCC South accolades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Rams, Tre Blair, Cassias Breland, Jarrett Boxley, Noah Conrod, Logan Jackson, Daniel Lauretti, Frankie Porrini and Victor Rosa all helped the CCC South Champions with All-Conference performances throughout the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over at Eastern, Edward Ansah, Logan Crowley, Carter Harris, Dante Marciano, Joshua Moore, Jack Mulcunry, and Dominic Tartarelli led the Lancers to pick up CCC South All-Conference awards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in girls track and field, Eastern’s Mackenzie Fitzsimons was a state champ in the javelin - making the CCC South team along with teammate Cecelia Gilbert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the Rams, Francesca Amara, Kylee Barnes, Destinee Kraft, Lynae Lewis, Rebecca Litwinczyk, and Sophia Stark all earned CCC South All-Conference honors.</p>
