<p>MANCHESTER - The Bristol Central boys cross country program made up part of an extremely loaded field at the CIAC Class L championships from Wickham Park in Manchester on Saturday morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, behind a tremendous performance from its All-American steeplechaser, Frankie Porrini, ended the day in tenth place overall in the team standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini nabbed 11th place overall at the event in 16:58 and for the third straight season, the harrier earned All-State honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Senior Captain Frankie Porrini did not have the Class L race he wanted, or we expected but that’s racing,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Even though he didn’t have his best day he placed 11th to make the All-State team for the third year in a row and earned the opportunity to race again at the State Open Championship next Friday.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teammate Chris Roy did extremely well, placing 24th overall with a time of 17:48.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That senior duo of Porrini and Roy were extremely proficient over a very busy 2022 slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, for the Rams, junior Patrick Wininger (18:10) came in 39th place, senior Lance Archibald (19:11) was 69th overall and Scott Petrosky (106th, 19:49) also ran well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our boys stepped up today to place 10th in a tough L race,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Seniors Chris Roy, Lance Archibald and Scott Petrosky ran their final race for BCXC&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>and left it all out on that course. I’m honored to have coached such wonderful boys these past four years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding up Central’s top seven were Nick DiMatteo (113th, 20:02) and Aiden Georgakopoulos (128th, 20:54).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Junior Patrick Wininger looks ready to lead a young and hungry team next year,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Sophomores Nick DiMatteo and Aiden Georgakopoulos have come such a long way this season and will step up to help us out even more next year.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier easily won the Class L title as the school’s top five athletes finished among the first 13 racers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program scored 36 points while New Milford (74) came in second place followed by Cheshire (148), Conard (162) and Shelton (176) to round out the top five.</p>

<p>The CIAC State Open event takes place on Friday, November 4 from Wickham Park at 2:45 p.m. and expect some big things from Porrini at the race.</p>

<p>The boys from Eastern competed at the Class MM Championships on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters ended up coming in 14th place overall and had several top finishers from Wickham Park.</p>

<p>The Lancers’ wheelhouse of Dominic Tartarelli (34th, 18:12), Jack Mulcunry (55th, 18:42), Brendan Tartarelli (76th, 19:13), and Aidan Tartarelli (91st, 19:46) were the top four runners from the Eastern program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also for the Lancers, Dylan Prince (112th, 20:22), Cole Beland (122nd, 20:50) and Benjamin Kozikowski (124th, 20:57) all ran well for the locals that day and over the entire 2022 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s certainly reason to be hungry for next year, but for now they should be proud of how far they’ve come,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski.</p>
