<p>BRISTOL - After Bristol Central volleyball sophomore sensation Lily Kirk tallied one final kill against Berlin on Monday night, the locals were already at the pay window ready to collective their payout over a 3-0 sweep from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 25-14, 25-17 and 25-20 in the opener for both programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kirk, slamming down just everything in her path, collected a match-high 20 kills to go along with five digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kirk, one of three captains for the Rams this season, looked sharp and certainly is one of the top sophomores to hit the courts each and every night in the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow captain Grace Higgins captured seven kills, three aces and seven digs over a busy evening while captain Alex Rivera, Central’s slick setter, roped up 27 assists, two blocks and eight digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Emily Fontaine added three kills, Leah Sklenka netted three kills and a couple blocked shots, Isabella Alves added two kills, Daigelis Figueroa bumped up 13 digs and flipped in a team-high four aces and Caitlyn Carbone had two digs to lead an outstanding opening effort by the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Redcoats, Gianna Miele and Ellie Cugno each supplied four kills, Alliana Wick added 11 digs and setter Rachel Karanda dished out 14 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an excellent start for the locals, the defending CCC South champs and Class L runners-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though the Redcoats were never able to capture a set, the visiting aggression kept things close but, in the end, Berlin was no match for a superior squad from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the Docket…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have plenty of CCC opponents to tangle with over the next week or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a big one against Maloney in Meriden on Thursday night (6 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the following week, the Rams are in action three times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It starts with a showdown against New Britain from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on Monday (6:30 p.m.) while the following day, it’s a rematch against Berlin on the road (6 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, on Friday, it’s a showdown against Class LL power Southington.</p>
