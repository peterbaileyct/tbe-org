<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May continues to load us with so many events for Pokémon Go. This one is beefy, so grab a poffin and catch some more knowledge!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Master Ball challenge is coming May 14! For those that don’t know, the Master Ball is 100 percent guarantee to catch any Pokémon as long as you throw it at the Pokémon and it touches it during capture. This rare item has only appeared two other times in the game, so here is your chance to catch another one. This event ends on May 19. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, The Daily Pokécoin Field Research Ticket is now available in Pokémon GO. The ticket will give you a field research task every day that will reward you with 20 Pokécoins every day for a total of 300 Pokécoins if you complete the tasks every day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You must buy your ticket between now and May 16. Pokecoins allow you to buy item in the shop that help you expand your storage, extra Pokéballs, avatar items, and more. You normally get these coins through purchasing them or in Gym battles. Now, you can get more coins to get ready for summer!</p>

<p>Niantic unveiled a short teaser of May 19’s Community Day, hinting at the appearance of two possible creatures. The seven-second clip starts with the shadow of a Flying-type Pokemon flying over grass, and then a Bounsweet jumps out of the bushes. This led to speculation in the community, as the shadow likely belongs to a Toucannon. Check the game for the update on which will be feature later this week.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just a reminder, from May 16 – May 23 Mega Gyarados will appear in Mega Raids. The Tapu Fini Raid Hours take place at 6-7 p.m. on May 8 and May 15. To take part in 5-Star Raids, you need to use a Raid Pass – you pick these up from a Gym once a day. You'll be able to take Tapu Fini on alone or as part of a team. Fail and you can try again as often as you can within an hour time-frame. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the known hot spots to find them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.<br>Bushnell Park, Hartford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, I did some digging and found some more info on Nercozma. A Pokemon GO leak has revealed that Necrozma's fusions will be available in the game. Pokemon GO currently has 61 Legendary monsters in its Pokedex, and players can catch most of them in 5-star Raids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list of Legendary Pokemon in the game will get bigger with the addition of Necrozma, one of the critters featured in Gen 7. The Psychic-type Pokemon together with Solgaleo and Lunala forms the "Light trio," which also speculates these guys may be in raids during GO Fest. Necrozma will debut at Pokemon GO Fest 2024's Raids, and more details to come as the weeks go on.</p>

<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we ready ourselves for the rest of the raids and some more summer themed in the World of Wonders event! For more information, visit www.pokemongolive.com. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
