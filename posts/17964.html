<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it won’t be easy for the Rams as the Bristol team squares off against an elite program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will test its mettle in a huge showdown against Windsor, a friend from years gone by.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not an easy week for the Rams but the outfit is certainly hungry after a very tough home loss to Enfield the previous week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor’s .500 ledger is deceiving as could be as has the firepower to overwhelm the Rams.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will happen on Friday when the squad squares off against the Warriors?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what we’re looking at as the Central program is ready for another big gridiron confrontation:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Windsor at Bristol Central – CCC Tier II Challenge&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>6 p.m. (Bristol Central turf field)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: It’s the 19th showdown between the programs. The Warriors lead the all-time series 14-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>Windsor picked up a 26-14 victory from home against Middletown. Central fell to Enfield over a surprise 49-7 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fast Facts: </strong>The Warriors are 2-2 only in record because the squad was three points away from being a perfect 4-0 this year…Windsor dropped an opening week challenge to Wethersfield (21-20) and fell at Shelton by a 22-21 final. That’s two losses by a combined two points…Wins came against New Britain (26-6) and Middletown…The Warriors have put their trust into first-year quarterback AJ Robinson (31-of-66, 451 cards, six touchdowns), showing tremendous poise as a ‘rookie’ …Senior Chilli White can flat out run with the ball, averaging 8.7 yards-per-carry. He’s already tallied 548 yards on 63 carries and eight TDs to date…Windsor averages 7.2 yards-per-carry and Central needs to slow those fast feet down…Robinson’s favorite target to date is junior Maxim Copeland (9 passes, 224 yards, 3 TDs) scoops in nearly 25 yards-per-catch and is an elite on-field weapon…Make no mistake about it. Windsor is offensively gifted but mistakes on the defensive end could be the exact opening the Rams should be looking for…Central simply fell behind against Enfield last week and never got a chance to draw even…The Eagles scooped up over 350 yards in offense and that number has to be capped against Windsor…The offense at Central continues to make strides as players gain experience and improve at their positions…QB Nik Salinas connected on eight passes for 125 yards against Enfield and his favorite targets were Tre Blair (4 passes, 77 yards) and Cassias Ireland (2-33)…Salinas nearly rushed for 80 yards - compiling over 200 yards in offense to lead the Rams…Carmelo Thompson continues to run well with the ball while Salinas made a 57 yard touchdown connection with Blair for the Rams’ only score of the game…Last season, Central allowed forty and fifty point games to Hartford Public and Tolland but those totals were matched – and then some – by a crafty athlete who helped UCONN beat Fresno State last Saturday (I think his name is Victor Rosa or something)…This is another big game for Central’s defense and the squad has to contain the strike-ability the Warriors brings to the gridiron…This is a tremendous challenge for the locals, looking to regroup as the bye week approaches.  </p>
