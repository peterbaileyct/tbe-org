<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voters, including poll standers--the ones 75-feet from the entrance holding signs for their candidates--who turned out on Election Day were both amazed by the turnout and ready for this year's campaign to end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Republicans and Democrats stood staunchly by their candidates, and at least one voter changed his mind after a recent rally where the now infamous "Puerto Rico is garbage" statements were made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through it all, the Bristol Chorale ran its annual Election Day bake sale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside West Bristol School, Republican poll standers, Tony Pratt and James Duquette, were in the third shift of a 2-hour stint that began at 6 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everyone’s been good," Pratt said. "Some people give us a smile and wave, and some give us a smirk, but that’s okay.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This cycle there’s a lot more people,” said Duquette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They both agreed that the turnout had been steady and more than they'd seen before.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nelson Rivera, who brought his dog, Bear, with him, after having voted said, "I hope all the nonsense stops after this."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he wanted some peace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School John Burgos just finished voting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“I hope I filled everything out right, the ballot was a little confusing,” he said. Burgos who was voting in his second presidential election. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he thought it would have been good to see the ballot in advance, that way he might have understood it better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were a lot more lines and options on the ballot than he expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I watched the Democratic Convention and rallies on social media for both sides," he said. "I think Harris’s policies are better, if she sticks to them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What ultimately helped him make up his mind, he said, were the infamous "garbage" comments at the Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>“The same thing happened last election” he said, after he remembered how Trump withheld funding for Puerto Rico after the Hurricane Maria. He switched his vote to Biden.</p>

<p>“We, Republicans, feel energized by this election to recapture the support of Americans in this seminal election year,” Griffin said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flanking the poll standers at BAIMS, the Bristol Chorale held its Election Day bake sale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were a little worried the increase in early voting would impact our election day bake sale," said board president Betsey Grady, "but it hasn’t, some people who voted early came down (to the polls) just to buy our baked goods.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said the cookies and breads are the most popular, but this year a new item, baked dog treats were selling well.&nbsp;</p>
