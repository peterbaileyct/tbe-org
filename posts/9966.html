<h5>(Correspondents’ insights-When the City Council made the original decision to reject the Wheeler Clinic building on Centre Square last fall, we dove deep into a rumor circulating around town about an alternate plan that would please everyone. We went directly to our City Hall source, a person we will call ”Deep Esophagus” to get the following major scoop.  Unfortunately, the Council later reversed the Wheeler decision. We just want the readers of TBE to see what might have been.)</h5>

<p>The Bristol City Council shocked the city yesterday by announcing that the Disney Corporation has agreed to develop a Disney Theme Park tentatively named “Bristol’s Fantasy Land” on the Centre Square property originally planned for the Wheeler Clinic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cheryl Thibeault, who originally led the council’s rejection of the Wheeler Clinic on Centre Square, was more than happy to share the details of the city’s agreement with Disney. “As I explained to everyone, most of the people I talked to while knocking on doors said they wanted entertainment downtown. And I thought, ‘What could be better than a Disney World in the Northeast?’ So I called them and they thought it was a great idea too.”</p>

<p>Councilwoman Sue Tyler added, “We already have ESPN here in Bristol. Why not a Magic Kingdom?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Councilman Andrew Howe said, “I have always loved Daisy Duck. And to think she’ll now be here in my home town.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thibeault also had an answer to the cynics that criticized the original decision to reject the Wheeler agreement. “Many naysayers said our vote was stupid, and that we couldn’t get entertainment downtown. Well, I went home and wished upon a star, and all my dreams came through.”</p>

<p>Councilwomen Jolene Lusitani and Jacqueline Olsen went into some of the details of the agreement. “We are happy to disclose these details, because as you know, we campaigned on the promise of an open government, said Lusitani.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Olsen added, “This contract will fulfill two of our goals. First, Centre Square will be a true destination for the first time since Tony Calbi had his clothing store. And second, we have solved the blight problem in the West End. Disney wants 387 acres for all their Park divisions, so we have sold them the section of town from the Centre Square property to the Wolcott and Terryville town lines. We only have to foreclose on and raze 687 homes, but most of those houses are ugly anyway.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeff Caggiano added, “We stressed to the Disney people that we insist on individual freedoms here in Bristol, and they have promised us there will be no mask or vaccine mandates in Bristol’s Fantasy Land.” When asked about potential traffic problems, Caggiano said, “We are going to study that. But I do have a background in science, so it shouldn’t be too much of an issue. Besides, we just fixed the bridge at Memorial Boulevard.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the press conference ended, all the members of the council stated that this should be the merriest Christmas of them all for every Bristolite. As they walked away, Caggiano said, “God bless us, everyone.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
