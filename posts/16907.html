<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Central football program had a banner year in 2021 thanks in great part to the amazing exploits of Connecticut’s Gatorade Player of the Year Victor Rosa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now he’s competing collegiately at the University of Connecticut and the Rams are back at it again with some different offensive weapons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has some good returning talent and certainly will give it a go this season in a new tier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to expect from the BCHS football program as the Rams hit the gridiron for the first time tonight against Manchester: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central Football – 2022 &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach: </strong>Jeff Papazian&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Career Record: </strong>In his eighth season as head coach, Papazian is 46-25 overall &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 Ledger: </strong>The Rams were 9-2 last season (6-1 CCC Tier III), qualifying for the postseason for the first time since 1987. Central fell to Class L champ Maloney in first round play (49-14). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Returning talent &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Replacing the offense from Rosa &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question</strong>: Who is going to churn in all the yards with several new offensive weapons in the mix? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key losses: </strong>Victor Rosa (QB/DB/ATH); Dan Lauretti (OL/LB); Malachi Jones (OL/DL); Dan Kitmanyen (WR/DB); Justin Despins (RB/LB); Ashton Zabka (WR/LB); Jarrett Boxley (WR/DB); Damion Glasper (WR/DB).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Line-up: </strong>Julius Powell (sr. OL/DL); Tre Blair (sr. WR/RB/DB); Nik Salinas (sr. QB/DB); Johnny Rios (sr. RB/DL); Mason Stokes (sr. TE/DL); Anthony Paulino (jr. WR/DB); Carmelo Thompson (so., RB/DB); Jack Jones (jr., OL/LB); Luis Padilla (jr., OL/DL), Jonmanuel Gomez (sr., OL/DL); Andrew Sarkis (sr., OL/DL).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to Expect from Bristol Central in 2022</strong>: All of the talk about this year’s squad is that fact that Rosa moved on to UCONN.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, if Rosa still had some sort of scholastic eligibility left, Papazian would take him back in a heartbeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s not like I didn’t resign the kid,” joked Papazian. “That’s how it works. He’s graduated.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the team over at Central isn’t exactly stripped of talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the program has a bit of a championship pedigree thanks to the boys basketball team winning the Class L championship last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that includes senior Tre Blair who can do a little of everything on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He caught several passes from Rosa in 2021 (16 catches, 302 yards, three touchdowns) and has superior speed, quickness, and can leap over anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair made 38 rushes for 342 yards, second on the squad, that led to a touchdown and a ton of tired defenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior is ready for a big senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a really dynamic athlete,” said Papazian of Blair. “He’s a kid coming back whose been there before and got the experience and played in big games for us. He’s been successful so we’re excited about all that he brings to the table for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair will be catching a ball or two from signal caller Nik Salinas, a senior who is stepping into a big spot but ready for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a sample-space from last season, Salinas made half-a-dozen carries for 85 yards and a TD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That dual-threat talent at quarterback has been a staple for the program over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What I’d say about Nik is nobody’s worked harder for this opportunity,” said Papazian of Salinas. “I believe good things happen to people who do what they’re supposed to do and put the work in the offseason. [We want to] put him in good spots that use his skillset to the best of his ability.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where are some of the other rushing yards going to come from?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enter Carmelo Thompson, another member of that boys basketball team, an up-and-coming athlete that’s going to be a force at running back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He might be young but he’s learning fast on the gridiron.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s got a chance to be really good,” said Papazian of Thompson. “He’s had a great summer. He’s really started coming into his own as a person and as a player. He’s got a really bright future in football and in basketball. He’ll be a big piece for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Johnny Rios might also see some time at running back as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Jones is also back in the fold and will take his spot at center.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played nine games for the program at that position as a sophomore and brings in experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6-foot-8 senior and basketball center Julius Powell looms big on the gridiron on both lines and also played in a game or two over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Luis Padilla (offensive, defensive lineman), and seniors Jonmanuel Gomez and Andrew Sarkis (offensive, defensive lineman) will also be called upon for support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Julius will be a big part of it,” said Papazian. “Luis Padilla is at the other tackle right now. Jack Jones is back at center. The two guards in Jonmanuel Gomez and Andrew Sarkis are big body kids that have some experience so they’re a hard-working group.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re hungry and ready to get after it. I think they’ll get better as the season goes on and on offense, we’ll go as far as they take us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Mason Stokes (tight end, defensive end) and junior Anthony Paulino (wide receiver, defensive back) should also be productive for the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experience counts in large amounts and Central has the will and the way to make the 2022 campaign a successful one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kids want to prove that they can get to the pay window like last season with its All-State talent now up at UCONN.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kids hear the noise,” said Papazian. “We lost Victor, they’re going to be down so the motivation piece kind of writes itself. We’ll see how we respond. We’re looking forward to it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved into the CCC Division II bracket due to its success but the goal is still the same: win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might be a little more difficult as Central, a Class L program, will have to battle many teams that aren’t the same size - whether bigger or smaller - along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opens up with Manchester tonight but the schedule gets a bit tougher as the month of October comes to pass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams battle Windsor (October 7) and Maloney (October 21) in back-to-back showdowns but will be contested from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>November opens with Wethersfield (November 4), New Britain (November 11) and, of course, Bristol Eastern finishes the scholastic slate on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ll have our hands full and that’s fine,” said Papazian. “We’ve played difficult schedules pretty much all the way through. We’ll never complain about that.” &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Can this team make a state tournament run?</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without a doubt, with a half-dozen divisions this season, the Rams have a chance to get into the playoffs in back-to-back years if the team can bring its A-game to its biggest contests of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney and Windsor won’t make it easy and if a shot of a playoff berth is on the line on Thanksgiving, don’t underestimate Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, don’t discount Central either as this squad is ready to rock and roll this year.</p>
