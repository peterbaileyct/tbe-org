<p> The City of Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Department (BPRYCS) has announced the return of the Holiday Gift Giving Program for the 2022 holiday season. The Annual Holiday Gift Giving Program provides assistance to eligible Bristol youth and families during the holiday season. New this year, BPRYCS is partnering with the Bristol Police Department for a “Stuff-A-Cruiser” event, teaming up with local businesses and organizations to have collection boxes stationed around Bristol, and hosting a volunteer wrapping day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BPRYCS Community Services Coordinator, Aubrey Minkler, is overseeing the program for the first time, and she reminds community members, “There’s numerous ways to get involved and all donations are distributed locally with gifts provided directly to Bristol families in need of assistance.”</p>

<h3>Stuff-A-Cruiser with the Bristol Police Department </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, Nov. 19, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the City of Bristol Police Department will be stationed outside of Walmart, 1400 Farmington Ave., for a ”Stuff-A-Cruiser” event where officers will be accepting donations to benefit the Holiday Gift Giving Program. The goal of “Stuff-A-Cruiser” is to collect new, unwrapped toys for youths up to 18 years of age. All donations are distributed to eligible Bristol residents receiving assistance through the BPRYCS Holiday Gift Giving Program. </p>

<h3><strong>Online wish list and collection locations</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>In addition to the “Stuff-A-Cruiser” event, an online wish list has been established and collection stations will be available for drop-off gift donations. Collection stations will be conveniently set up within businesses around Bristol beginning November 1st. The online wish list provides an easy and convenient way to donate directly to the program. Wish List Donations are shipped directly to the BPRYCS Main Office where they will be wrapped and organized for pick-up.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Volunteer wrapping event </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BPRYCS is looking for volunteers to help organize and wrap toy donations on Saturday, Dec. 3, from 10 a.m to 2 p.m. at Page Pool. Interested community members are asked to please sign up at <a href="http://www.bristolrec.com/">www.BristolRec.com</a> or email <a>parksandrecreation@bristolct.gov</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, the program supported over 430 youth from 180 families in Bristol with the help of 70 local sponsors and hundreds of individual donations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those looking for assistance this holiday season are asked to fill out the application (available at <a href="http://www.bristolrec.com/">www.BristolRec.com</a> or in person at 51 High St.) and return it to BPRYCS no later than Friday, Dec. 5. The program application process includes income verification, proof of address, and birth certificate submission.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community Engagement Coordinator, Erica Benoit, noted that submitting a Birth Certificate is a new step in the application process this year. “This is such a positive program, we want to keep it honest and this will help ensure that the communities’ generous donations are going to those who could greatly benefit from the assistance,” Benoit remarked.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
