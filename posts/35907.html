<p>Documents from the State Elections Enforcement Commission (SEEC) reveal that Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano was the chair of the Republican Town Committee when the RTC endorsed a controversial candidate for mayor in 2017 contradicting statements that Caggiano made during the regular meeting of the city council earlier this month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the public participation segment of the council meeting, Morris "Rippy" Patton addressed his comments to Caggiano, regarding the mayor's time as RTC chair, in building an argument that the mayor has not addressed inappropriate behavior among candidates that he has had a role in endorsing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton: I want to comment on the recent WTIC debate ... at the restaurant across the street and I know at one point you were asked a question about the racist issue in Bristol and you pivoted. I appreciate what you did with that; however, what you did was bring up the Ken Cockayne administration. You took the former administration to task for not creating an ordinance around people who commit atrocities in city hall -- and salute to all of you for doing such. But let's also keep in mind, and I can't believe that you didn't think this up, in 2017, when you knew that mayor was committing sexual atrocities and harassment in city hall you were Republican Town Committee chair and endorsed him for mayor. Right. You signed that paper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano: I'll answer your question. I denounced him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton: That was you, you made him the candidate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano: No, no, no. I did not. Actually, I was not the RTC chair when that happened. I was nominated the RTC chair right after he was nominated. But I was part of the RTC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton: I stand corrected. I appreciate that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Documents filed with the SEEC show that Caggiano was Republican Town Committee chair from June 29, 2016, to Oct. 14, 2021. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano was contacted by TBE to clarify or correct the record but did not respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patton, a Democrat who is running for City Council in the District 2, continued his comments to reiterate statements he made two-months ago about racism being a human issue, more than simply a personal one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"So right now you have someone who put themself out there as an antisemite, serving on our Board of Ed in a month, with no competition. That is because of you. You did that," Patton said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When you are asked about her, you defend her, you pivot. You don't defend children of the Jewish faith, you don't defend children of color, you don't say anything about LGBTQ+ kids, the children she is going to make life harder for. You defend her."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The person in question is Jennifer Van Gorder, who has been endorsed by the RTC, under the current chair, former Republican State Rep. Whit Betts. Van Gorder is on the November ballot and will run uncontested for the Board of Education as part of the restructuring of the board since the city instituted four-year terms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Van Gorder posted an image on Facebook in May 2021 that incorporated the Star of David and equated the experience of the Jews in the Holocaust to mandates for vaccinations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The image and post resurfaced recently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The controversial mayor, Ken Cockayne, was censured by the then city council for his behavior. A lawsuit was filed and reported on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city, which was obligated to defend its elected officials at the time, ended up defending the mayor and settling with the defendant in the case, a city hall employee. The cost to the city for the settlement and defense fees exceeded $200,000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current council adopted a revision to the Code of Ordinances this past May under Sec. 2-23, Removal and Sanctions of Public Officials, that would consequence inappropriate behavior under the following circumstances:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>1) been convicted of a felony; or</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>2) been convicted of a lesser crime involving fraudulent or dishonest conduct; or</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>3) been found by a Court or state agency to have engaged in unlawful workplace harassment</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>against any other elected or appointed officials or employees of the City of Bristol; or</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>4) been found to have violated the City Charter or the Code of Ordinances.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Correction: Caggiano's response to Patton's inquiry about his role as RTC chair was corrected from, "I will answer your question. I did not understand" to "I will answer your question. I denounced him" as the result of a reader contacting us and providing a clearer recording. </em> </p>
