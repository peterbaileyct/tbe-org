<p>BRISTOL - There was a major difference between the Bristol and Tri-County Senior American Legion baseball squads when the two programs battled on Saturday night in a non-zone showdown from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Tri-County team was already playing its sixth contest of the season while it was Bristol’s debut gamer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 showed glimpses of what could be but the locals fell by a 9-4 final in its 2022 opener.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This was the fist time in a long time that our first game was an exhibition game which was kind of nice,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “You can tell that [Tri-County] played six games. They are in there settled with some good swings. They’re a good club anyway [5-1]. They all play the field well. They swing the bats one-through-nine but I told the guys I’ve got a lot of 19 year old kids that haven’t played in about a year except for a few that played in college. And a few guys weren’t here but I thought in the second half of the game, we played well.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 had a three-run sixth and nearly put together a late rally that just fell short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Ryan Fradette was extremely busy in the first inning of play, making all three putouts in centerfield - sandwiched around a walk from Matt Beaucar - as Bristol quickly came to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the top of the first, Roberto Cruz tapped a bloop single to right, stole second, but ended up stranded to end the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second, Tri-County’s Oliver Ross and Dan Orzeck smoked out back-to-back hits before tomfoolery ensued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette made a fourth straight putout and then Beaucar picked off Ross at second on a slick move and eventual tag by Cruz for the second out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Steve Leliberte smoked a double to left to plate Orzech followed by a slicer from RJ Stanford to right as the lead runner scored to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the second, Beaucar drew a one-out walk, advanced to second on a groundout by Tyler Stickles but Dylan Woodsome flew out to center as the visitors held its 2-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Alex Canzellarini came in to throw in the third, walking pinch-hitter Luke Pennella to open his stint on the mound, scoring on a Wagner double to make it 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Canzellarini hit the next two batters and then Orzech came through with a two-base hit - scoring two - as Bristol trailed 5-0 through two-and-a-half innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Chris Osuch started the bottom half of the tilt with a full-count walk, advancing to second on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin struck out, Tri-County made a pitching change and Cruz was plunked the second he got to the plate - putting two on with two away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo advanced on a wild pitch but Adam Caron bounced out to short to close the frame as it remained a 5-0 game though three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-County’s Jeremiah Bobbi opened the fourth with a one-out single up the middle but Post 2 got out of the jam as Bristol still trailed by five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette tallied Bristol’s second hit of the game, an infield nubber which the speedster hustled out, and later stole second to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runner went to third on a Beaucar ground-out and Fradette scored on Tyler Stickles one-hopper to right as the deficit was chopped to 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Tyler Martin on the mound in the fifth, Chase Davidson singled to right and Ross followed with a deep shot to left center as Davidson scored to make it a five run affair again, this time at 6-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Bryan Capazzone started the bottom of the stanza with a one-out single and advanced to second via a wild pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the runner never came home as Tri-County continued to lead by five as the sixth inning commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-County scored three runs in the sixth, highlighted by a run-scoring single from Wagner and a sacrifice fly by Brad D’Amico to made it 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Post 2 gave it a whirl in the bottom of the sixth inning - loading the bases up off a sterling double by Fradette, Dillon Hudson was hit by a pitch, and when Beaucar singled, Bristol had something brewing with the bases loaded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stickles grounded out to the pitcher and the throw home got Fradette for the second out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the ball was thrown away to first - allowing Hudson and Beaucar to score - as the deficit was chopped to 9-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It seems like the last four of five years, our Bristol teams have always shown fight even when we’re down,” said LaPenta. “We always seem to battle back a little bit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one final single from reserve Connor Cyr to left center scored Stickles and going into the seventh, Post 2 trailed 9-4 as the locals were starting to put things together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Some of my dual rostered kids got a couple nice hits,” said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz fanned the side in the seventh inning, allowing just one base hit, but the home team needed to score five in a hurry to keep the game alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol never quit as Ryan Maglio and Cruz earned back-to-back walks with one away but a 6-4-3 double play ended the game as Bristol dropped the contest by five runs, 9-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 should be in good shape as the season rolls along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the first Zone 1 game taking place on Sunday versus Meriden, LaPenta will have Cruz on the hill in a big-time showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Roberto had a just a light little warmup there. He’s going to start” against Meriden on Sunday said LaPenta. “He looked really good [tonight]. He threw the ball really well.”</p>
