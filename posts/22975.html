<p>PLAINVILLE - The Bristol Eastern boys basketball squad broke its five-game skid on Friday night as the Lancers bounced Plainville by a 64-50 final in a CCC South showdown from the Ivan Wood Gymnasium in Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a huge win for Eastern (9-8 overall) as every late season victory helps the Kingstreeters with its postseason positioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tonight, getting the victory was important,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “But how we did it was even more important.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils (4-13) were officially eliminated from the state tournament fray over the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved its shot selection over second half play after a spirited first period in which the visitors hit 6-of-10 shots.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers then missed 9-of-12 attempts over the next eight minutes as their shooting percentage dropped down to 41-percent for the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern flipped the script over the third and fourth periods, hitting 14-of-23 field goals (60.8-percent) - dropping 3-of-5 shots from three-point territory as Bristol turned an early one-point third period edge into a 45-33 cushion with 2:18 left to play in the frame via an 18-5 run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of the things we were doing in the first half was bombing away, shooting a low percentage,” said Ray. “We were awful from the free throw line, and we were shooting too quick. We were giving [Plainville] possessions and there you go, we’re even. So, then we maximized our possessions, [then Plainville] shoots quick, we get a couple of [hoops] and there’s your lead.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not to mention it helps to go inside-out and grab those threes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the stars shined for the Lancers as Zaveyn Tate led all scorers with 16 points (6-of-8 field goals), seven rebounds, three assists and two steals over another complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Dauphinais played extremely well, draining 5-of-10 shots from the field for 14 points, to go along with four rebounds and five assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lukas Sward collected 13 points, two rebounds, six assists and did not commit a turnover while sharpshooter Ben D’Amato dropped in 11 points and was aggressive from the field from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reserve Jordan Chisholm provided six points and three rebounds while Brady Bell and Donte DePass saw action during the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, once again, reserve power forward/center Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum was critical over Eastern’s winning efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He canned two shots for four points, gobbled up six rebounds and added a couple blocks to keep Plainville at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a match-up problem,” said Ray. “Plainville’s bigs were doing a good job. [Bynum] went in there, he was backing Nate [Saucier] down a little bit. We went to Bynum, he knocked down a couple shots, got a few rebounds and that’s the name of the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There were loose balls that we weren’t getting. He cleaned up and we ended up getting those.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Eastern hit 51-percent of its shots overall and 39-percent from long-range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Plainville, despite subpar shooting (32.7-percent), hung around over the first 18 minutes or so, out rebounded Eastern on the offensive glass by over half and committed just nine turnovers despite very aggressive offensive play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joseph Vasquez led the Blue Devils with 15 points, making seven clutch free throws, while Roman Lee added 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brady Wieczorek scored four points but battled foul trouble while the big man tandem of Nijaz Srdanovic (eight points) and Saucier (six points) did a solid job keeping things close early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I credit their coach,” said Ray of Plainville’s Jeff Hoyt. “He’s done a great job throughout the course of the year. I’ve been there. He’s got them playing really hard.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dauphinais and D’Amato kicked in back-to-back threes early in the first period and off a lay-up by Sward - who got to the rim at will - at the first period horn, the Lancers secured a 15-12 edge through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second stanza, Plainville’s Jayden Castro hit a 3 and when Vasquez connected on a short jumper, the Blue Devils led 17-15 with 7:07 remaining before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an Eastern timeout, Dauphinais canned a hoop, Chisholm dropped in a three and on two free throws by Tate, the visiting aggression scored seven straight points to snare a 22-17 lead with 3:17 remaining in the second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville then scored seven straight points as Eastern’s long range game was foiled and with 1:45 left before intermission, the home team enjoyed a 24-22 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The threes we were taking in the first half weren’t good threes,” said Ray. “They were off dribble, swing passes. The rhythm threes are the inside-out action. Those are the ones that matter.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sward hit late free throws and off one final Chisholm 3, Eastern netted a 27-24 lead at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Closing the deficit to one, Plainville’s luck ran out to start the third tilt as D’Amato hit two threes and Bynum drained a couple jumpers - helping to post that 18-point third period effort - and the Lancers led 45-37 through three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils cut the deficit to 47-38 with 7:20 left to play but Eastern closed the door on the game moments later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quick 10-5 run - with Tate opening and closing the burst with slick lay-ups - allowed Eastern to snatch a 55-41 edge with 4:26 remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sward quickly hit for three straight points and with 2:40 to go, Eastern stalled things a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville canned late free throws but could not put much of a dent in the final decision as Eastern won a huge 64-50 contest on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This league is difficult,” said Ray of the CCC. “If you look at [Plainville’s] scores, I saw how close the scores were, how much [they] were competing, and I warned my guys. I said, ‘we’re a long way away from that first game [that Plainville lost 54-24 back on December 15].’ And it showed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But we are also better in terms of our maturity and what we need to do. I think that goes a long way for us.”&nbsp;</p>
