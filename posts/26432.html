<p>The Bristol Police Dept. is providing owners of Kia/Hyundai model cars that are susceptible to theft with "steering wheel locks" and encouraging owners to contact area dealerships for assistance with software updates that, if applicable, will deter theft, according to a release yesterday evening.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BPD has obtained a quantity of “steering wheel locks” that lock a steering wheel in place, protecting the vehicle from being driven if it were “hotwired” or started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a Bristol resident and own a Hyundai or Kia vehicle between the years of 2011 and 2021, please bring your valid vehicle registration and CT ID/Driver’s License to the BPD Front Desk to receive a free steering wheel lock. Owner/Resident verification is required. It is a limited supply, available on a first come-first serve basis.</p>

<p>A second anti-theft initiative is free software installed through the dealership. Owners need to contact their dealership where the vehicle was purchased or a local dealership to see if it qualifies for the upgrade. Owners may then bring the vehicle to their local Hyundai/Kia dealership to have the system installed at no cost to the owner. It is important to note:</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If the vehicle is push-start, it may have the anti-theft software.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>If your vehicle is key start, it does not have the software option.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>All Hyundai’s manufactured after November 2021 have the software standard in the vehicle.</li>

<p>Lastly, Hyundai is potentially offering reimbursement to owners who have purchased anti-theft devices out of pocket. Visit www.HyundaiAntiTheft.com to learn more.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The BPD currently has an officer dedicated to auto theft and has been assigned to the Greater Hartford Regional Auto Theft Task Force (GHRATTF). This team, on a local and regional level, specifically focuses on auto theft and related crimes commonly associated with auto theft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to increases arrests, the auto theft officer and the GHRATTF are actively working with Kia/Hyundai to develop alternative methods that will combat thefts.</p>

<p>If anyone has information regarding auto theft or stolen vehicles that may be helpful, please contact the Bristol PD or Officer Daniel Perkins at (860) 584-3000 or danielperkins@bristolct.gov.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
