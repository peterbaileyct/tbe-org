<p>The Lancers had 19 turnovers in the game, and many of those came in the nightmarish second stanza. To add to their misery, Eastern shot an Ice Age 10% from the floor in period 2. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury and Autumn Udoh combined to score 26 of Eastern’s 33 in the game. Drury scored 15 and Udoh had 11. The entire remainder of the Lancer roster  combined to eke out 7 points.</p>

<p>Berlin’s Emma Ellison led all scorers with a 20 point performance.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
