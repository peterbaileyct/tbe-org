<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have been to another sensational show at Hartford Stage. Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" has returned to Hartford Stage after a hiatus of five years. When Mary told me that it was back, weeks ago, I didn't think much about it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, I was ho hum about going. On the night of the show, Saturday evening, I had to force myself to get out of the house. And then magic happened. Well, right from the beginning of the show, the magic streaked across the stage in the form of characters costumed in white, spirits and sprites, with their presence announcing that the territory of this play would be, as we know, beyond the constraints of ordinary reality. </p>

<p>Terrific show, and well worth getting out of the house for. And of course, we are plotting to get the grandkids out to see the next rendition in a year. They are a bit young for a foray out to Hartford this year, so it's going to have to be later rather than sooner--better late than . . . , you know the rest.</p>

<p>At TBE, you might have seen that Bob Montgomery has begun writing a new column, "Bob's bits." If you missed it, check out Saturday's posts. It's good to have Bob working with us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, it is the end of the year and TBE, functioning under our nonprofit, The Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization, accepts donations that for qualified filers are tax deductible. Whether or not you quality for tax deductions, we could use your help. We are looking to establish ourselves as a going concern, one that will be here for a long time.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week starts with beauty, and the Hidden Brain podcast, entitled "The Mystery of Beauty." Two experts put a whole new spin on the concept, which we might conflate with products meant to enhance how we look. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These two take beauty to a new level. Neuroscientist Anjan Chatterjee lays out the groundwork for how beauty works in our everyday life, and Nobel Laurate Frank Wilczek provides the background on how beauty was behind some of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of recent times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much of the discussion is a bit wonky. Stick with it. Things become clear. In the end, beauty may take on new meaning. If you have, like me, been struck by something Keats wrote many years ago, "Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know," beauty has been something to mull over--and with this discussion there is a way to begin to see how poetry and science have more in common than not.</p>

<p>Reading this week has been limited to a bunch of New Yorker articles about writers, both from the Nov. 27 issue. The first article is on Joyce Carol Oates, "Personal Statement: Joyce Carol Oates's relentless search for a self," by Rachel Aviv and another, "Ghost, Writer: When a friend died, she left behind a novel that need finishing," by Leslie Jamison.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are the type of articles to get lost in, especially since when I picked them up I had no intention of reading them; and then I find myself two pages in and without a good reason to stop, even as the minutes fly by and a hundred tasks call my name.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
