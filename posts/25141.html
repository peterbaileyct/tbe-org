<p>Frank Gerard Beecher, of Bristol, passed away peacefully surrounded by the love of his family on Tuesday April 18, after a short but courageous battle with cancer. He was the loving husband of Ellen (Banasiewski) Beecher for 43 wonderful years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank was born on Dec. 1, 1958, in New Britain, son of the late Leonard Beecher and Mary (Cleary) Beecher. He met the love of his life, Ellen, at 16 years old in 1975 when they were attending New Britain High School. At New Britain High, Frank was a frequent participant in baseball when not working to save money for college. </p>

<p>After graduating from high school, Frank attended Hartford State Technical College, focusing his studies on Information Technology. After graduating, Frank and Ellen married in November 1979 in New Britain and later relocated to Bristol where they raised their three sons and built some of their strongest friendships and fondest memories.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During Frank’s career, he worked for several companies like Travelers, The Hartford, from which he retired, and then to COCC in Southington, where he was still actively working from his hospital room. He had a passion for his career, which was driven by his outgoing and vibrant personality. He was always successful, earning multiple recognitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank loved many things, including travel, building and flying his fabulous kites, as well as, his prized rockets, which family and friends were in awe of at his numerous launching events. He loved sports. He played softball with his sons, coached Little League for nearly 18 years, and was an avid fan of the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Bruins, the Boston Celtics, and of course UConn basketball. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a Cub Scout leader throughout his boy’s younger years and aided with developing dozens of Pine Wood Derby cars. Frank loved bike riding, disc golf with his COCC buddies, and the ocean, but most importantly spending time with family and his five beloved grandchildren. He cherished the annual family vacations at Cape Cod and Rhode Island. Above all else, he was fiercely dedicated to his family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank was the most selfless and generous person, always thinking of others over himself. He loved to tell stories and jokes, and no matter the situation, he was the life of the party making friends anywhere he went. His laughter carried with him and all those surrounding him. His charismatic personality was magnetic and will not be left unremembered. We are comforted by the countless memories we have and are better for having him in our lives. “We don’t remember days…we remember moments."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to his wife Ellen, he leaves his children, Daniel (and wife Dana) of Oxford, Steven of Bristol, and Jeffrey (and wife Jennifer) of Ohio. Frank was an incredible grandfather to his beloved grandchildren, Landon, Quinn, Cohen, Callie, and Connor and will continue to be their guardian angel. He is also survived by his brother John (and partner Lorna). He was preceded in death by his parents, Leonard and Mary Beecher, and his younger brother, James Beecher.</p>

<p>The family would like to thank his medical team at Smilow who provided support and relief during his hospital stay. The selflessness and kindness of the staff during this difficult time is immeasurable.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
