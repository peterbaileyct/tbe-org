<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew again! I hope you all had a great weekend with family and friends! There is a lot in this article to cover, but I’ll do my best to highlight the local scene exclusively here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community Bagon Day! It’s starts tomorrow, Sunday, April 7. Just like Litten Day, you can catch the dragon Pokémon Bagon, and the shiny form too! It’s from 2 to 5 p.m. I will be doing this event over in Rockwell Park, so if you are there, you can meet me in person! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to check out the other hotspots for this event, look below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.<br>Bushnell Park, Hartford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you guys purchased the Wonder Ticket, Part 2 is coming out! If you are a fan of Eevee and their evolutions, this will be perfect for you. Each evolution type gets a new costume, and this part is loaded with extra features. It’s $9.99, and it does grant you access to Part 1 and Part 3 coming soon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mega Charizard X is also coming to raids near you! Make sure you use your best dragon-type Pokemon to beat this one. This one can come in a shiny form, but the chances are 1 in 60. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will gear us up for the Kartana, the Ultra Beast Pokemon! This grass and steel type is super weak to fire, and Charizard happens to be fire, and a strong fire type at that. Have a least four trainers with you for Charizard, and seven people for Kartana. The raids for Charizard and Kartana start at 10 a.m. today. Kartana ends on April 12, and Charizard ends on April 14, both at 10 a.m.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you can’t make it to Bagon day, the Europe International Championships are here! The event started on Friday, April 5, and ends on Sunday, April 7. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
