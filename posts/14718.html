<p>WEST HARTFORD - With an eye on a big weekend, the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team dropped a tough 7-1 decision to Zone 1 leader West Hartford on Thursday night from Conard High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 moved to 13-0 in Zone 1 play (14-1-1 overall) while Bristol fell to 6-5 (6-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol matched West Hartford hit-for-hit as both teams scooped up nine for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals have been hitting the ball much better as of late and against Post 96, Post 2 had some good tallies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol seemingly hit ball to a waiting defender each and every time the squad tried to rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought we swung the bats well,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “[But] we hit the ball right at them. They had a couple bleeders and a couple bad hop [hits]. This field’s not that great [and] our ground balls seemed to go right to them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar (1-3 overall) drew another tough luck loss for Bristol but was limited in terms of pitch count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol pitcher went 2.2 innings, allowing just four hits, five earned runs, three walks and two strikeouts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But by staying under 60 pitches, Beaucar can throw on Sunday when Bristol plays a twin bill against Meriden, along with fellow starter Roberto Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Because we have three games this weekend, with one on Saturday and a doubleheader on Sunday, I couldn’t leave Matt in,” said LaPenta. “I need him for Sunday to pitch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford chucker Lucas Pyrro (5 IP, 6 hits, 4 Ks) did not allow a free pass over the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the first, Bristol’s Adam Caron (2-for-4) reached base via infield hit to shortstop and when the ball was thrown away to the first base fence - the runner was awarded second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Caron never advanced as West Hartford got out of the jam and quickly came up to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Post 96’s first two batters got on base via singles and with runners on the corners and one away, West Hartford scored on a double steal attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ty Redden was out at second base as Bristol catcher Chris Osuch made a perfect throw to the bag but David Cantarella (2-for-3, two runs) scored from third as West Hartford led 1-0 through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Beaucar struck out Andrew Seidman to start the bottom of the second, Chase Hanawalt reached via error and when Ixael Albino walked, two were on for the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 6-4 fielder’s choice erased Albino going to second and Beaucar caught Brian Chelli looking at strike three to end the frame as Post 2 was hanging around, down a single run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pyrro cruised through three frames, allowing just the one hit to Caron, to go along with three Ks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cantarella etched up his second base hit to lead off the bottom of the third as West Hartford was looking to increase its 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Dooley induced a one-out walk and Tom LaSpada just laced a single over the head of Tyler Martin at second base - loading things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seidman’s sacrifice fly to center scored Cantarella to make it 2-0 and a base-on-balls to Hanawalt juiced the bases once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Alex Canzellarini came in to pitch for Beaucar, allowing two two-out RBI walks to Dooley and LaSpada as the home team edged in front, 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chill then blasted a two-base hit to right, plating two runs, as Bristol trailed 6-0 though three completed innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Alex did okay,” said LaPenta of Canzellarini. “He struggled [against Chelli]. He had a full count and Chelli fouled a bunch off and then he got a hit. If he gets off the hook there, it’s 4-0 still.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron then made it 2-for-2 in the top of fourth with a one-out single up the gut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette followed with a base hit to left and Tyler Stickels (2-for-3, RBI) blooped a single to short center as Post 2 had the bases loaded with one away for Dylan Woodsome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Woodsome bounced into a 5-2-3 double play as Pyrro wiggled out of a big jam midway through the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Woody’s ball, if that could have taken a bad hop there, maybe we get a couple runs,” said LaPenta. “Next thing you know, it [would have been] 6-2 or 6-3.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dooley slapped a one-out single up the middle in the bottom of the fourth but Canzellarini and Bristol defense did not allow any additional offense as it was a 6-0 contest going into the fifth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin beat out an infield hit in the fifth but never advanced while Brendan Grady singled in a run in the bottom of the stanza, making it 7-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Mike Roalf came in to throw for Bristol with one out and fifth after hitting Cantarella with a pitch, the bases were loaded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Roalf did not allow any additional offense as Bristol looked to finally crack the scoreboard in the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pyrro threw 66 pitches through five as Simon Rosenburg took the mound for the home squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s when Post 2 attempted to rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Churchill (2-of-4, run) greeted the new pitcher with a base hit to left and advanced to second on a botched pickoff play with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After two fly ball outs, Stickles jammed in a triple - the first of the season for Bristol - to the gap in left, scoring Churchill, as Bristol made it a 7-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connor Cyr was then plunked by a pitch as Bristol had men on the corners with two outs but Roberto Cruz hit a liner right at the fielder in left to end the rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf posted two quick outs in the bottom of the sixth, fanning Seidman, before yielding for Martin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After allowing a double to Hanawalt, Martin induced a pop-out to Caron at third - moving the game into the seventh and final inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by six, Ryan Maglio flew out to right, Osuch bounced out to short, but Norris roped a single to center to keep the contest alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then slammed a double to the same spot as Post 2 had two runners in scoring position but Caron ended the game with a fly ball out to center as West Hartford won it, 7-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve just got to keep plugging along and get to where we’re playing good for the playoffs,” said LaPenta.</p>
