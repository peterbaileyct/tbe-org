<p id="isPasted">The city's Streetscape project moved one step closer to completion with the announcement of a $6.85 million Community Investment Fund grant from the state's department of economic and community development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Bristol delegation, including Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano and state representatives Mary Fortier and Joe Hoxha, were on hand for the announcement at the State Legislative Office Building on Tuesday. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier, all members of the Bristol legislative delegation, including Hoxha and Fortier, along with state representative Cara Pavalock-D'Amato and state senator Henri Martin, signed a letter to the CIF board advocating for the grant.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="isPasted">The Streetscape project, or Rt. 72 Corridor Improvement Project, was announced several years ago and focuses on pedestrian safety and streetscape improvements on Riverside Avenue and Park Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="isPasted">The project will mirror elements already in place on North Main and Main Streets, and will include the installation of sidewalks, lighting, signage, trees, and curbing along the busy corridor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the city has several applications in the running for the next CIF round, including proposals for capital improvements submitted by several non-profits on Riverside Avenue, to be considered by CIF in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among these are the BHA/Vesta Group’s redevelopment of the Sessions Factory into housing, plans for expansion and improvements to American Legion Post #2, improvements at the New England Carousel Museum, and potential upgrades to the Disabled American Veteran’s facility that will continue to seek funds in future rounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next round of applications for CIF will be reviewed in May 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Community Investment Fund was established by the State Legislature in 2021 to support economic development in distressed communities by providing grants for capital projects to municipalities and non-profit entities operating in those cities and towns. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proposals must advance the state’s Economic Action Plan by promoting jobs, fostering vibrant neighborhoods, and addressing climate resilience as well as the specific needs of underserved or marginalized groups.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.                </p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
