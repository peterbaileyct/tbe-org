<p>The Bristol Zoning Commission unanimously approved three applications from Carrier Construction Inc. on Wednesday night for the building of the Centre Square Village project. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hearing centered on the site plan and parking for a 152,000 square-foot mixed use development on North Main Street and Hope Street, which features modern residential housing and commercial space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how excited I am as somebody who’s ready to invest in downtown Bristol,” said Louise Provenzano, “and I think it’s a well-designed site plan. I’m looking forward to it being built. We’re getting a downtown.”</p>

<p>Provenzano is the chair of the Bristol Zoning Board Commission. Fellow commissioner David White (vice chair) shared Provenzano’s excitement about the project.</p>

<p>“Personally, I have been waiting over 50 years for this project,” said White “There is nothing about this project that I do not like. I have absolutely no concerns.”</p>

<p>Centre Square Village will consist of two buildings totaling 156,000 square feet. The upper floors will house 104 residential market-rate apartments ranging in size from 680 square-feet to 1,650 square-feet. The ground floor will have 15,600 square feet between the two buildings designated for commercial space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The property is designed to potentially accommodate currently four restaurant spaces,” said Timothy Furey, “several of which can have outdoor seating areas, the primary being at the corner of Hope Street and North Main Street, the commercial space facing onto North Main Street servicing the vibe of the downtown.”</p>

<p>Furey is an attorney at Furey, Donovan, Cooney &amp; Dyer PC in Bristol and a member of the Centre Square Village Development Team.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the overall response to the Carrier applications was positive, Bristol resident Daniel Sutula voiced his concerns with the development.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nothing should be done on this application you started until there is a commitment from the financial institution for this project,” said Sutula. “Because if things get going and the ball falls out, the city is going to have a major problem.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think that the plan the appraisers have, they’re looking to get too much out of it,” continued Sutula. “It’s a high-density proposal, and that may not work out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sutula, now retired, worked as the real estate officer for Bristol Development Agency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you really break it down, 104 units,” said Furey in response to Sutula. "We need to attract 250 people, most of which actually live here. This is not a crazy heavy lift to make it work.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a hard time attracting people to come work here because they don’t want to live in a three-family house, they want to live in housing like this,” Furey added. “It’s time for the leap of faith.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.&nbsp;People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</p>
