<p>I thought I’d do a segment on New Year’s resolutions, something that many do and do not follow through with annually. I also wonder what percentage of resolutions stay intact for 365 days?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mine is to be kind to others and help them out from time-to-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spoke with retiree and lifelong Bristol resident Marie Griswold over Christmas, and she said: “I don’t believe in them. I never follow through anyway.” An honest lady!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ginny (Ziogas) Torreso. Ginny, former Bristol Eastern and Pace University award-winning basketball player, said there are probably 199 to consider, and has to think about it. P.S. She looks as young and fit as she did in high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MaryAnn (Euley) Kowalczyk, whose career was in teaching, hadn’t thought about a resolution, but then said: “Maybe more of a healthy lifestyle and exercise.” Covid.19 took her away from all of this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Linda DiMatteo, a retiree of the local Chambers of Commerce, feels that the world is upside down, among other things. She said that her hope is that we can have peace in this world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Note: Linda added that this is not a resolution, but this is what has been on her mind.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Al and Jane Goodwin are retirees from Yankee Gas and Bristol Hospital, respectively. Al said that it’s to, “Stay alive and well in ‘24” and hold more music nights (as a D.J.)  to keep the great music of 50's and ‘60s alive for friends. (He hosts such parties at his home on occasion.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jane resolves to lose 10 pounds, and to continue cooking for the Agape House. She and her husband are givers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorette (Nocera) Caouette, who I live with, doesn’t make resolutions due to the reason that she can’t stay with them. She’s a Harvest Bakery retiree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rachel Warner is from Plainville and works for Max IV Pizza: “It’s to laugh and be happier.” Rachel always serves up the “to-go” pizzas with a smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dave Palin, a former Bristol resident, moved to the Sandusky, Ohio, area after New Departure left here to re-located. He’s a Vietnam veteran and avid bowler. He started out with duckpins at the former DiPietro’s here, before taking on ten pins. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s admitted to slowing down as a league bowler today in having 13 300-games and seven 800 three-game sets. He’s determined and has given himself a resolution to add to the number of these top scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joan Keyowski, who I once served with on the Salvation Army Advisory Board here, said she normally doesn’t have one. Like most of the folks in today’s column, I caught her off guard. She’s a sweetheart!.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corrine Greaves, who grew up in Forestville and has been living in Southington, told me she doesn’t believe in them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jana Lombardo, my oldest daughter, said that “It’s to be more present with God and everyday activities/life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jana is a hairdresser, mother of five and a grandmother to two girls. (A third is on the way.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In closing, I thought I’d add another one. After having a rough year health-wise, I’m going to be more tolerable to those who have physical issues. I recall a relative who was always cranky, and now I understand.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
