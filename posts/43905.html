<p>Linda was proud to be a registered nurse for the last 47 years. She was known for being so kind and compassionate and truly loved her patients. She had a strong faith and always believed that no matter what happened, God had a plan for her. She enjoyed singing in her church choir at Holy Trinity in Terryville and participating in the pit chorus of the St. Thomas Passion Play in Southington. She also loved to spend her Sunday afternoons watching NASCAR and cheering on Joey Logano. Her greatest love of all, though, was her family – especially her grandchildren. Nothing brought her greater joy than to spend time with Grace, Halle, Lucas and Emma. She felt so blessed to have them and was such a wonderful Mimi.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
