<p>The registrar's office is in good space for early voting to begin this Wednesday for the District 3 city council seat that opened up earlier this year with the resignation of one of the district's council members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are ready for all of district three to vote early and on July 30," said Jennifer Brunoli, assistant registrar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting, if the primary in April was any indication, was slow, so Brunoli said that the office does not expect any lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"But we will have deputies assisting us if we get overcrowded."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting will be held, Wednesday, July 24, through Saturday, July 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in city council chambers. The candidates are, for the Democrats, Mark Dickau and, for the Republicans, Sal Mazzarella. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to get to city council chambers, Brunoli said, is to enter city hall from the North Main entrance, take the elevator to the first floor and follow the signs to the council chambers. Voters will need a photo ID.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Nothing has changed since April," she said. "It's the same procedure. It's similar to going to the polls. They get checked in, they get their ballot, and they can vote in a privacy box, it's all secured into a ballot box, and they are all set."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the District 3 special election, anyone who votes at Bristol Eastern High School or at Greene-Hills will vote at BAIMS. They will return to voting at their polling places for regular elections, including the Republican primary for U.S. Senate later in August, when all nine polling places will be active. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
