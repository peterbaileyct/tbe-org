<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Records are made to be broken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s especially true when it comes to Thanksgiving Day football from Muzzy Field - pitting Bristol Central against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tremendous athletes have sprinted up and down the historic venue at Muzzy and some of the records captured during the Battle for the Bell in Bristol have stood for decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s going to happen this time around in 2021?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will Central’s Victor Rosa or Eastern’s Alex Marshall establish a new record or two?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will the Rams win for the ninth consecutive time on their way to the Class L playoffs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who will step up to ring the brass bell by the completion of the contest?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look - via the Bristol Central website - of all the Thanksgiving Day records from the historic Battle for the Bell:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Washington made scoring runs of 40, 2, 4, 11 and 69 yards in the victory over Eastern. He ended the season tied for the state record in touchdowns scored in a single season with 42.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Rosa matched that feat in 2019 in the overtime win over the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most yards rushing - 353 yards, Tim Washington (Bristol Central), 2000</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most receiving yards - 161 yards, Rick Schmaltz (Bristol Eastern), 1970</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest fumble return - 70 yards, Edgar Hernandez (Bristol Eastern), 2016</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Best punt average - 4-for-50, Dave Cichon (Bristol Eastern), 1965<br></strong>*Cichon zipped out kicks of 46, 55, 57 and 42 yards (which adds up to 50 yards-per-punt)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Longest field goal - 25, Jeremy Meccariello (Bristol Eastern), 2012</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most interceptions - 3, Gordon Sargent (Bristol Eastern), 1963</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
