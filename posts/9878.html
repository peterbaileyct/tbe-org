<p>BRISTOL - Statistically, there’s not too much more Bristol Central superstar Donovan Clingan can accomplish on an individual level on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four-star rated center was the 2021 Connecticut Gatorade Player of the Year after averaging 27.3 points, 17.2 rebounds, 5.8 blocks and 3.1 assists-per-game as a junior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, without the benefit of a major postseason run and a shortened campaign in 2021, his numbers - in terms of totals - simply jump off the page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Clingan has tallied 1,421 points and snared 1,002 rebounds over his three years at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s 1,421 points and 1,002 rebounds tallied in <em>only </em>58 career games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, Central was one-and-done during Clingan’s freshman season as the squad dropped a hard-fought 65-61 decision in overtime at New Milford in CIAC Division III first round play against a program that nearly attempted 45 three-pointers in order to stay away from that 7-foot dynamo in the paint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Green Wave, in fact, is the only program in the state to be able to claim a postseason victory over the Rams to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore, after a 17-5 ledger, the pandemic cancelled the playoffs&nbsp; in 2020 and then last year, the Rams went as far as they could (15-0) during another COVID-infested campaign (can you say it nicer than that?).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of Bristol’s all-time top scorer, St. Paul’s Carey Edwards dropped in 1,835 points before leaving for Manhattan and the MAAC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is just 414 points away from tying that amazing record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s a lot on the line,” admitted head coach Tim Barrette. “Donovan has an opportunity early in the year - god willing with his health - to break his mom’s rebound record for the school which could happen as early as game two.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stacey Porrini graduated from Bristol Central in 1993 after scoring 846 points and snaring 1032 rebounds for the girls team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps a 30 rebound game against Southington today in Hartford is in order to tie his late mother’s amazing ledger?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of points at the school, Martin Huckaby (1984-1988) scored 1,825 points and that’s another record Clingan is gunning for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He has an opportunity at the scoring record for the school as well,” said Barrette.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The individual records are certainly an amazing accomplishment for the young man but he knows that the ultimate prize is about team accomplishments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the prize he craves is a CIAC Division II state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we won that CCC Tournament title, [Donovan] said to me ‘one more,’” to go said Barrette in terms of a state title. “It’s been our goal from the beginning. We know we have the opportunity but we also know a lot of things have to go our way to be there in the finals come March.”</p>
