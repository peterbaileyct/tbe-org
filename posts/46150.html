<p>Well, sports fans, another legend died yesterday. Bill Walton was an awesome player and an entertaining TV analyst. Cancer claims another soul way too early.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Boulevard--an inside source at City Hall told TBE that the geese, in a generous peace offer, sent a text to the mayor offering to stay off all sidewalks and only gaggle on the grass. The mayor said he was open to negotiations with the geese -- as long as they all ended up dead.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">This day in history</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On this day in 1788, the Federalist Papers*, a series of 85 essays on the proposed new United States Constitution and on the nature of republican government, written in 1787 and 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay—were published in book form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Interesting fact -- .004 percent of the American people have actually read the Federalist Papers</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
