<p>She&nbsp;became interested in local government while in elementary school when she would attend city meetings with her father, who served on the Board of Finance. After graduating from Providence College in 1990 with a degree in Political Science, Zoppo-Sassu&nbsp;went on to earn a&nbsp;Masters&nbsp;Degree in Public Administration with a concentration in local and urban government from the University of Connecticut in 1992.&nbsp;Previously she had worked for the Connecticut Pharmacists Association as the Director of Communications; as&nbsp;Development Director at the Boys &amp; Girls Club&nbsp;and Family Center, and at the New Britain Chamber of Commerce. &nbsp;She also served&nbsp;as the part-time Director of Development &amp; Grants for the Bristol Historical Society where she has worked to bring in over $1,000,000 in the last 18&nbsp;years to restore and renovate the city’s first high school as a cultural&nbsp;hub.</p>

<p>In 2001, Ellen ran for the City Council representing the Second Council District, which marked the beginning of 6 productive years on the City Council career of working for issues of importance to working families, seniors and children in Bristol.&nbsp; She quickly earned a reputation for getting things done, and solving long-standing problems and issues for both the departments she worked with, and for the people in her council district. In that period, the city’s code enforcement initiative was organized, the library was renovated on time and under budget,&nbsp;the City created the&nbsp;TEAM (Tourism, Arts Entertainment and Museums) Committee&nbsp;and 3 city parks were renovated.</p>

<p>She previously served as Chair of the City of the Bristol’s Cemetery Commission from its inception in 2008 until June 2013. During her tenure, the Commission secured almost $25,000 in private grant funds and in-kind donations to restore the ancient cemeteries, created a management agreement for the city-owned Lake Avenue Cemetery and garnered a national preservation award from the Daughters of the American Revolution.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you have done well that justifies your reelection? What are you specifically going to do to ensure that&nbsp;&nbsp;progress continues.&nbsp;<br><strong>Over the course of this last term, the City Council team and I have focused on resiliency&nbsp; so that the City was well positioned to adapt to unexpected circumstances, to quickly recover from adversity and bounce&nbsp; back. I believe that Bristol excelled during the pandemic and showed the depth of its experienced employees in keeping residents safe, services running and businesses assisted. Meanwhile, our team welcomed 40 new businesses, engaged in strategic planning, are discussing the $28 million in American Rescue Plan dollars and are putting the finishing touches on the future of downtown.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What work have you done to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there more that needs to be done?&nbsp;<br><strong>This is an ongoing effort. We have made strides by actively encouraging participation by people of color and different religious and ethnic backgrounds on boards and commissions. In 2017, there were 5 or so; today there are over 40. Departments have also begun the efforts internally to have the DEI discussion, and we had Police and Fire collaborate on a hiring diversity initiative last spring to attract more minority candidates to these critical positions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are taxes in Bristol too high or fair as they are? If you think taxes are too high, what specific cuts would you recommend to bring them down and how would you deal with the impact on services and programs?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>No one will ever agree that any tax is fair, so we work hard to ensure that all public services are high quality, while we continue to search for efficiencies. I do believe Bristol residents receive very good "bang for their buck," whether it is education, Public Works, great Parks, Library and Senior Center offerings, or professional paid police and fire response, which is linked to homeowner insurance rates, and more. We have combined departments, have eliminated over a dozen positions and repurposed duties to achieve greater efficiency with the staff, as well as ensured we have solid leadership in the departments. We have had a 2% cost of living increase each year which is about what households and businesses are facing as well. We are sympathetic to fixed income households, and enacted 2 senior tax credit programs to help.&nbsp;</strong></p>
