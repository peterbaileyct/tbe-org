<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As autumn rolls in, Pokémon GO continues to captivate players with exciting events and updates. Here’s a roundup of the latest news for Pokémon GO fans in Bristol:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debuting after Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Skwovet and Wooloo, Beldum is now appearing in Max Battles located at Power Spots across the map. Its final evolution, Metagross, is an imposing pseudo-Legendary Pokémon that's one of the best attackers for Raid Battles, so having a Dynamax-capable version in your collection is sure to come in handy for future Max Battles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max Raids are hosted in Power Spots, which appear as glowing purple icons on the map. You can also check the Nearby feature and scroll across to the Power Spots tab to see Max Battles that are within reach of your current location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, the Marvelous Minds: Psychic Spectacular Collection Challenges are running in Pokémon Go until Sunday, Sept. 22, at 8 p.m. Like every other past Collection Challenge, you must catch every Pokémon on the below list before this deadline if you want to earn the rewards it offers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the Pokémon in the Marvelous Minds: Catch Collection Challenge, along with how to find them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Finally, the Psychic Spectacular event has Psychic-type Pokémon on everyone’s minds! From Sept. 18 to Sept. 22, at 8 p.m. Trainers will be able to encounter a mind-blowing array of Psychic-type Pokémon (and Pokémon of a similarly whimsical nature) in the wild. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to keep a Calm Mind and aim your Poké Balls with care during the event—successfully catching Pokémon with Nice Throws or better will award additional Candy, and Trainers level 31 and up will also have an increased chance to receive Candy XL. That’s not all—Trainers will also earn 2× Catch Stardust during the event.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
