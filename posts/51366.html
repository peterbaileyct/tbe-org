<p>During the August 28 Board of Education meeting members talked about year goals, students and community participation, strategic plans and a Dyslexia Awareness Campain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A member of the School, Family, Community and Partnerships Committee said the goal for the 2024-25 school year was to improve their partnership with families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We do wish that there was more involvement because we are meant to be the voice of the community,” they (female) said. “But we have limits to the way that we access the community too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another member said there was conversation about how to get student representatives a “seat at the table.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We talked about expanding the scope of what they’re reporting to us and have it be a really sort of student-led approach,” they (female) said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The members of the committee also mentioned that South Side School has started a “watchdog” program to provide an in-depth scope on what is going on in the school. They said the purpose is for them to see what direction to go in when implementing rules and strategies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Greenhills has a great one [watchdog program] and that’s community, not staff, and maybe they have something to share,” they said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the members mentioned a big goal of the committee is to create a safe space for concerns to be heard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We want everything to be in a place where people are comfortable and feel safe to express their concerns,” they said. “If we help create those spaces then people do less taboo you know what I mean.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other news, the committee mentioned September is National Library Card Sign-Up Month and the library is doing raffles and other events for the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s just another, maybe, example of how to support the great things in our community,” they said. “Lifting those resources up, but obviously having an impact on student learning and supporting our educators in the classroom and how we might be able to do that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They also mentioned the October Dyslexia Awareness Campaign that is going to be presented in the BPS through the Office of Dyslexia and Reading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It hits home for me but I know it hits home for a lot of families and how we can support even if can from this seat support things that are happening on a state level,” they said. “Especially with this example of Dyslexia Awareness Campaign.”</p>
