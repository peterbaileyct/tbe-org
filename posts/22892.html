<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team ended its home slate of games this season with a resounding 44-17 blitzing of Plainville in a CCC South bout from Bristol on Thursday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was senior night for the Lancers (10-9 overall) as the program honored the career of its lone four-year player, Taigan Parent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior guard - a standout shooter who was simply tremendous for the Lancers over her four seasons - made it a memorable night, with members of the both the girls and boys basketball programs wearing special Taigan Parent t-shirts in her honor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she assaulted the hoop just moments into the showdown as Parent blasted in a 3 just seven seconds in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crafty senior ended up with a double-double of 17 points and 10 rebounds over her final scholastic regular season game from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s had a great senior year,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd of Parent. “She’s the only senior here this year. We lost Ciara [Collins] and Janessa [Gonzalez] from last year and especially with a surrounding cast of freshmen, sophomores and couple juniors, she’s done a great job helping to mold those guys. They’ve been meshing together very well.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s been helping bring those younger kids along.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent also added two assists and three steals off another complete game effort, draining four three-pointers along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman sensation Autumn Udoh nabbed her usual double-double of 11 points and 11 rebounds while swiping four steals.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel did a solid job off the bench, scooping in five points, four rebounds and a career-high four steals, Lauren Ayotte nabbed four points and four rebounds while Leah Roy collected two points, six rebounds and two assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury added a hoop and a team best five assists and six steals, Tavia Swain snared three rebounds while Grace Browne, Hailey Beebe, and Gabby Piendak all added something over the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters led wire-to-wire as the Blue Devils (3-16) just couldn’t get any lasting momentum in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense was the key as Parent dropped in two 3s while Udoh added one of her own in what turned into a suffocating 15-0 opening game run as Eastern turned its quick stops and steals into offensive opportunities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shutout lasted nearly into the final minute of the first quarter, but Plainville’s Cookie Montanez and Hailey Anderson hit back-to-back hoops to trim the deficit to 15-4 through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Blue Devils nearly went 16 minutes between field goals as Eastern’s defense held firm over the second and third quarters of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought the kids did a good job,” said Floyd of his crew. “They focused on defense. That’s what we worked on. We played good defense in the game, and I thought that’s what they did a great job on.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent opened the second period with a 3, Noel canned two straight hoops and off one final free throw by the senior standout, Plainville was held scoreless in the second stanza - trailing 23-4 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We executed our half-court game,” said Floyd. “We also did some things we needed to work on.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters started the third tilt with two hoops apiece by Udoh and Ayotte and with 6:06 to go in the quarter, Eastern’s cushion reached 31-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the third, Drury found Parent for her fourth and final 3 while Udoh calmly sank two charity tosses as the Lancers etched up a 36-7 edge with just eight minutes left in the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 2:40 left to play, Parent split a pair of free throws as Floyd subbed for the senior one final time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guard received a tremendous ovation on her way back to the bench with the Lancers comfortably ahead 37-13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the game, Beebe canned a foul shot while Roy and Piendak put back misses for hoops - leading to the eventual 44-17 triumph by the Lancers with their final regular game at Bristol Central on tap on Monday (6 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They stayed focused which was nice today,” said Floyd. “I was very pleased with all the kids today.”</p>
