<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern football team, over past games this season, has done a most of its offensive damage in first half play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after a scoreless two quarters against Plainville on Friday night, it was time for the Lancers to flip the script.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters notched all thirty-five of their points over a blistering second-half while the defense pounded the Blue Devils the entire game - leading to an impressive 35-6 victory against Plainville from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second straight win for Eastern (2-5) while Plainville fell to 0-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re finally coming back,” said Eastern’s Gavin Damboise. “It’s a new half of the season. We’ve just got to keep [going].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense was truly the name of the game, highlighted by a tremendous 47-yard interception touchdown return by Zaveyn Tate while making a couple tackles for losses along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Zavecz added his first sack of the campaign while Austin Shorette also tackled a couple Plainville rushers behind the line of scrimmage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the time Plainville, still competing without star quarterback M.J. Bakaysa, notched its only touchdown of the game when quarterback Joe Vasquez found Joe Kennedy for a 15-yard TD reception with 2:35 left, the ultimate decision was not in doubt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville was limited to just over 180 yards in total offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were lights out [on defense] which was really nice to see,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “[We] were building on a good defensive performance from last week [against Lewis Mills] where, even though we gave up twenty-one points, the defense only gave up two scores. We almost pitched a shutout [against Plainville].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Plainville’s game plan defensively worked as Alan Quirion, and a tremendous effort from the front line, kept the pressure on as all of Eastern’s four first-half drives stayed on the Lancers’ side of the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tim is one of the best coaches in the state,” said Julius of Plainville coach Tim Shea. “It’s not up for debate. He’s proven it wherever he’s been. We knew [Plainville] was going to be super-prepared and they were. And his kids played hard. We had to play a really good game to win this tonight and credit to our guys here at Eastern, we rose to that expectation.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville bolted into the red zone twice over first half play but came up empty both times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first incursion was foiled with 4:43 left in the first tilt as Plainville turned the ball over on the Eastern 13 yard-line but to end the half, the visiting aggression was driving towards the goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a 10-play drive, the Blue Devils got to the Eastern six but a huge five-yard tackle for a loss by Tate and one final incomplete pass at the buzzer kept Plainville off the board as the scoreboard read 0-0 at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Like I told the kids in the huddle at the end of the game, I truthfully believe what turned that game for us was the hold at the end of the first half,” said Julius. “Plainville did a nice job, got down into the red [zone],&nbsp; and our defense held. We got four stops when we needed it and at the end of the half, we go in 0-0.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We knew we were getting the ball [to open the second half], we felt good about our adjustments at halftime, and the kids played really well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next two periods, Eastern’s defense led to offense and when the home team got the ball back, the chains started to move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Offensively, we couldn’t get clicking in the first half,” said Julius. “But we definitely elevated our level of play in the second half.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the opening series of the third period, a nine play Eastern drive saw Kyle Babin end it with a slick move and three yard sprint into the goal from the left side as Eastern was on the board with 7:01 remaining in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what turned into a botched extra point attempt, PAT holder Chase Dauphinee somehow out-ran most of the Plainville defense - splashing into the end zone via a two-point conversion rush that gave Eastern a big 8-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re we supposed to kick it, but the snap wasn’t the best so my holder [Dauphinee] couldn’t put it down,” said Damboise. “But he got it out and got the two points. We did good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the Eastern kicker booted the ball to the Plainville one yard-line on the ensuing kickoff to induce a very long field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quick three-and-out, the Lancers started at the Plainville 31 with Jack Hartley making three big rushes and once Eastern got to the edge of the Blue Devils’ goal, Jaiden Fore (25 rushes, 95 yards, two touchdowns) went up the gut for a two-yard TD jaunt as the home team led 15-0 with 1:23 left in the third tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kids put a really good second half together,” said Julius.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 15-point cushion didn’t last as Zavecz forced a fumble early in the fourth frame and then on Plainville’s next series, Eastern’s Rayshon Andrews (nine rushes, 47 yards) scooped in a Vasquez ball for his first interception of the year with 8:24 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrews was rewarded as he scored on a three-yard TD rush and with 7:35 to go, it was a 22-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An onside kick led to a recovery by Eastern’s Nelson Riley and then on the next series by the Blue Devils, Tate quickly snared a Vasquez pass, rumbling down the BE sideline for a huge 47-yard touchdown return, as Eastern was cruising - ahead by a 28-0 push with 4:09 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vasquez eventually found Kennedy for a 15-yard touchdown connection with 2:35 remaining but just 61 seconds later, Fore went up the middle for a three-yard scoring plunge and with 1:34 left on the clock, Eastern was comfortably ahead 35-6 - winning by that same margin in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s good to see the kids playing well,” said Julius. “That’s what’s exciting about this whole thing.”</p>
