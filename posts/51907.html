<p><strong>Two fine men</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was saddened when I found out that two fellows that I knew of and had met often passed away recently. The older man was Vernon Koch, 85, a legend in the Lutheran community, here in Bristol after making his mark elsewhere. He was an organist, headmaster, teacher and more. He had a lot of friends and admirers to say the least.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There also was 80-year-old Carl Wusterbarth, a retired City of Bristol longtime employee. I recall he always went outdoors to walk during lunch. He was an outstanding long-distance runner in track and cross country for Bristol Central who went on to compete in the sports in college. He also served in Vietnam.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Fiondella -- like father, like son</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob, the son of Bob, the retired insurance CEO, started an organization called Amy’s Angels and was a part of a Connecticut news station segment on Tuesday. Amy's Angels funded a $150,000 special bed for a Waterford toddler who is blind with a number of other disabilities.</p>

<p>The boy is active and during the day may bump into walls, etc. A well done once again to our fine Fiondella family. You are awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Dennis Floyd’s personality</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was thinking of who I should write about here, and one of the folks whose name came up was that of Dennis Floyd. Wouldn’t you know it, Dennis delivered my meds from Beacon Drugs on Tuesday. What a delightful surprise!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve always thought that Tony’s younger brother was cool. A retired Bristol firefighter, Dennis has delivered oil for Quinoco, and has done part-time work elsewhere. No slouch for sure!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the tube</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, on TV this week was Donovan Clingan briefly talking about his NBA Portland Trail Blazers. Can’t wait to see him playing on the tube.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Shout outs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the folks at the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame, Bristol Historical Society, Bristol Salvation Army and Tramps, John E. Smith, Tom Barnes; George Klimek, Pete and Victor Cwiek, Dave Palin, Joe Englert and Sonny Nocera. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>My thoughts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ease up on the presidential race. It’s not the end of the world and worth fighting about. My BFF and I don't agree, so we try not to talk about it. Otherwise, we get a little loud. Be a close family ... who else really loves you.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
