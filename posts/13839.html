<h2>Bakery on Maple co-owners tie the knot</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way Dave Landi of Bakery on Maple tells it he and Erika Stirk, co-owner, didn't want to have to deal with all the hoopla associated with a wedding, so when it came time, they just made the decision to do it. They chose the date, Saturday, May 22, and they enlisted Bob and Kevin, of Broadview Manor to help with the ceremony. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"They are great friends and hosted our special evening," Dave said in an email recounting the event. As witnesses, they chose good friends Carolyn and Eric from Dusty Dude Woodworks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Of course, we were running late and still had orders to finish," he said. "Bell City Diner has a wholesale account with us for cupcakes that go on their giant milkshakes, and they needed more."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Erika headed home to get ready, while Dave stayed and baked and when the dust settled, they were two hours late for their own ceremony. "I was off to get married in a dirty hooded sweatshirt!" he said. Everything went great, he said, and added, they partied until midnight and then it was home to sleep and back at the bakery at 3 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They celebrated over Memorial Day by taking a mini-honeymoon in Burlington, Vt. "We truly enjoyed Burlington," he said. "They have a wonderful spirit of inclusiveness and community with just a hint of New England sass to keep things lively." One week earlier, Erika and David celebrated the first anniversary in business of Bakery on Maple.</p>
