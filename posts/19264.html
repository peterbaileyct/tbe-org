<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In March of 1967, Bristol police officers were dispatched to Washington Heights to observe an object in the sky, which appeared to be a UFO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The officers spoke with Gertrude Pease of Stonecrest Dr. and her neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Louis Roy. The eyewitnesses observed the object through Mr. Roy’s binoculars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the report filed by the officers, “All three persons stated that the object had moved from its original spot where it was first seen and then it turned from red to orange color.” The officers, Sgt Leon Galske, Lt. David McGivney and two other patrolmen, also observed the orange object through the binoculars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officers reported the object was seen for quite some time in the eastern sky. Upon arrival to the station the UFO was still visible in the sky.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
