<p>Sen. Henri Martin (R, District 31) spoke in support of improving safety for healthcare providers and patients during a public hearing at the state capitol on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We have seen in recent years a startling spike in verbal abuse and physical attacks on doctors, nurses, and hospital staff," said Martin, according to a press release from his office.</p>

<p>The fifth-term senator, who introduced the bill, said that the legislation for Bill No. HB-6741 was put forth in response to a spike in abuse of hospital staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proposed legislation includes a marketing campaign regarding mistreatment of healthcare providers and encouraging public civility in health care settings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bill also establishes a hospital security grant program for securing hospital entrances and public places and permits hospitals to make policies that govern when a patient receiving nonemergency care can be removed from the site if their conduct threatens the safety of a health care provider, staff member or another patient at the hospital.</p>

<p>In his testimony, Martin said that studies have shown that healthcare workers, especially nurses, are up to 16 times more likely to be subject to workplace violence than other workers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There should be zero tolerance for any type of hostility toward healthcare workers," Martin said. "And the public needs to know any acts of threats or violent behavior will not be tolerated in any facility. “</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
