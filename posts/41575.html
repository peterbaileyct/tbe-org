<p>Last week, TBE wrote of the impressive improvements in standardized test scores in elementary math and reading from the pre-Covid year of 2019 to the 2023 results. Bristol outperformed all the other school districts in their Designated Reference Group (DRG) and even showed more improvement than many school districts in higher socio-economic groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are actually many other accolades that Bristol schools earned in the last school year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three schools named 'Connecticut Schools of Distinction'</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Nov. 1, 2023, the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) released results from the 2022-2023 Next Generation Accountability System, a system where districts and schools earn points on a broad set of 12 indicators. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This system moves beyond test scores and graduation rates to provide a more holistic perspective of district and school performance. Three of our Bristol Public Schools — Ivy Drive, Mountain View and South Side — were named "Connecticut Schools of Distinction."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
