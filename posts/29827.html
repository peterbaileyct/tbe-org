<p>BRISTOL - In the final elimination game of the Connecticut Twilight League playoffs on Monday night, it seemed like the showdown was boiling down to the first team that was able to tally a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took several innings to determine that victor, pitting the top ranked Wolcott/Terryville Scrappers against sixth rated Bristol Shock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end,&nbsp;a two-run sixth was enough to overcome the Shock as the Scrappers nabbed a huge 2-0 victory from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott, the defending CTL champs, battled against No. 2 New Britain Rock Cats in the 2023 championship series.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the campaign at 10-14 but nearly got into the title tilt - simply running out of gas in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Shock had to square off against wily veteran chucker Kyle Dube – no stranger to Muzzy Field from Bristol American Legion Baseball days gone by. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went four strong innings, allowed one hit, walked one and fanned four over a tremendous start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol countered with Mark Creamer, another no-nonsense pitcher, and the game was on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first, Bristol’s Kyle Lentini dropped in a blooper with two away, stole second and got to third via error but did not score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Creamer was also sharp, fanning Alex Rauso midway through the first, as the game was a scoreless affair through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dube induced two fly-outs while striking out the final batter he faced in the second while Creamer allowed one free pass and nothing else to keep things scoreless.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt,&nbsp;Tommy Stagis reached base via error and when Jordan Banks was popped by a Dube pitch, two runners were on in the third with two outs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lentini just missed another Texas leaguer, this time in right, but the Scrappers had nothing on the board after three as Creamer had faced one batter above the minimum.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dube continued to keep Bristol batters off-balanced into the fourth, nabbing another strikeout before walking Justin Martella with two gone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;Kyle Daddona grounded out to end the half-inning while Wolcott generated its first hit of the game in the bottom of the fourth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To lead off, Alex Rauso dropped a flare into left while Creamer walked the following batter - on a couple borderline calls - before a run-scoring chance came and went for the Scrappers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sacrifice bunt was misplayed by Bristol, loading things up, before a scrum at first base caused Rauso at third to break for home.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rauso&nbsp;was gunned out at the plate and off a collision at first, Bristol turned to a new pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacobi Bouchard was put in a very tough spot with one out and runners on second and third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a slick over-the-shoulder catch by Kyle Daddona and throw over to second base gave Bristol an inning-ending double play to keep the score 0-0 through an eventful fourth inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the fifth, Bristol’s Jon Blais reached on a miscue, swiped second base but did not advance as reliever Kody Kerski (3 IP, five Ks, one hit) closed the door on the attempted Bristol rally.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still scoreless going into the sixth with the Shock’s three, four and five batters were due up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;Kerski sent the trio down in order as the Scrappers squared off against Bouchard in the bottom of the sixth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed a one-out base-on-balls, Andrew Hinckley reached on an error and Bristol coach Rick Barrett turned to pitching ace Chris McGrath in an attempt to get out of the jam.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with one away, Justin McCoulluch laced a single down the right field line, scoring the lead runner, as the Scrappers scooped up a 1-0 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One out later, another RBI single doubled Wolcott’s edge to 2-0 going into the seventh.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kerski held the fort, striking out two before Patrick Kelley slapped a single to right as the winning run was at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But pinch hitter Rick Barrett struck out to end the affair as the Scrappers advanced to the finals via its 2-0 victory over the Shock.&nbsp;</p>
