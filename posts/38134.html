<p>A second presentation by Post 2 historian Neal Supranovich will cover guardsmen from Bristol who were activated for World War II. In February 1941, members of C. Company 169 began a full year of training in the South, in anticipation of the U.S. joining the war effort. The Day after Pearl Harbor attack, they were activated into the regular Army and after their training joined the war effort on the Pacific front. They were in New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, Russell Islands, and Rendova, New Guinea and on to Luzon.  </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
