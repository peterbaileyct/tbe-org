<p>It took the confused cubs nearly a minute to cross the street. The mother bear was not spotted during the encounter.</p>

<p>Traffic stopped in both directions to allow the cubs to cross.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will also be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
