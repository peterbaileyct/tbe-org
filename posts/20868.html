<p>Roland J. Dumont, 90, of Bristol, joined the love of his life, Shirley Butler on Dec. 12.&nbsp; While Roland died peacefully, surrounded by family, peaceful is not necessarily the right word to describe him.&nbsp;A quick witted, savvy businessperson with a true entrepreneurial spirit, Roland was never afraid to take on a new challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>He was born to adoring, hard working parents, Jean Baptiste and Beatrice (Gibeault) Dumont, on Dec. 24, 1931-- everyone’s “Christmas gift."&nbsp;He loved playing football, among other sports, at Bristol High School where he made many lifelong friends and went on to attend and play at Brown University.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>In October of 1956, he was close to moving to upstate New York to manage a MetLife office but decided to stay in Bristol and open the Roland Dumont Agency, Inc. Starting in the attic of his home, Roland based the business on his core values of hard work, honesty, positive attitude, and service to the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>The business grew to include a large real estate and property management operation.&nbsp;One of the many properties he managed was Jerome Estates, where he knew and assisted residents on a regular basis.&nbsp;After Roland transitioned the business to his late son, Jim, he continued to visit the office daily until just a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>Roland always had a soft spot for youth-oriented community programs.&nbsp;He generously supported many of them, as those who wore an agency-sponsored T-Shirt would attest.&nbsp;He also never left a dining establishment without making new friends and “breaking bread” with old.&nbsp;Roland was a fixture in the Bristol Community and loved his hometown very much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>He and his wife, Shirley, were among the Founding Families of St. Paul Catholic High School and gave most generously of their time and resources to make it the strong institution that it is today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>Roland was predeceased by Shirley (Butler) his beautiful and gracious wife of 62 years; son, Jim Dumont and sister Mary Jane Bellemare.&nbsp;He is survived by daughter Cheryl Dumont Smith and husband, Attorney Ed Smith; son Scott Dumont and wife Lori (Fiano), and daughter-in-law Melanie (Wentworth) Dumont.&nbsp;He leaves eight loving grandchildren: Attorney Meghan (Kyle), Ryan (Kerianne), and Dr. Patrick (Karla) Smith; Matt (Stephanie) Dumont and Elizabeth (Patrick) Flynn; and Hannah, Olivia, and Christian Dumont.</p>

<p>They will all remember his regular coaching advice as he rarely missed one of their sporting events and would always get to know most spectators at the game. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>He also leaves 11 great grandchildren, with one more on the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>We will all remember Roland with a drink in hand and a smile on his face, always finding sunshine even when the forecast called for rain.&nbsp;He truly was the eternal optimist and lived the lyrics of one of his favorite Frank Sinatra songs--"My Way."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
