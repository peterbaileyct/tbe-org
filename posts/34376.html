<p>The Zoning Commission regular meeting on Monday featured the election of officers and approval of live work units downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attorney James Ziogas proposed to the commission to make an amendment to remove references to live work units and then to add live work units as a permitted use in the downtown business (BD) zone, which was approved due to the fact that it permitted mixed uses and was consistent with conservation goals established back in 2015. </p>

<p>New business was highlighted by the election of officers. David White was unanimously voted in as chair. Thomas Marra was elected vice chair and Richard Goodwin, secretary. </p>

<p>The meeting began with the usual approval of minutes for the August meeting. There was also an approval of minutes from the special meeting from July 26 which did feature an addition from Secretary Thomas Marra, amending the minutes with a line about how the issue of prohibited uses and who makes the decisions went undecided, which had gone unnoted. </p>

<p>The zoning enforcement report for the month of September mentioned how the biggest issue faced was unregistered vehicles on properties, with 12 different incidents. The report also mentioned six citations from the last month and 404 building permits which was higher than the same time last year.   </p>

<p>The receipt of new applicants included a change of Zone R-10 to 1 at 16 Andrews St. A proposal was introduced for a special plan for construction and site plan both for a Unified Residential Development (URD) to feature 11 units on 15 Haviland St. </p>

<p>Another proposed zoning regulation seeks an amendment to add definition for climate control self-storage facility, with a special permit making off street parking a requirement. Another applicant sought an amendment to allow for URD by special permit and site plans in the RM zone. All of these applicants were sent to public hearing at the Oct. 16 regular meeting.</p>

<p>Previous applicant wrote a letter requesting a five-year extension on their project. It was originally approved on Oct. 10, 2018. and ran through until Oct. 10. The commission voted to extend it all the way through Oct. 10, 2028.</p>
