<p>BRISTOL -&nbsp;The boys tennis squad from Bristol Eastern might just have one victory this season but the program just kept at it during regular season play this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to 1-12 overall off its 4-3 loss to crosstown rival Bristol Central on the road this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the squad never gave up this spring, earning a home win against Middletown back on May 11 while also turning up the heat on several other local programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the campaign on April 4, the Lancers scooped up three points over a tough 4-3 loss at Manchester and did the same in back-to-back matches against RHAM (May 3) and a week later against the coop program from Meriden but just missed out on three wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern senior Camden Michaud is the No. 1 singles player on the squad while fellow senior Chris Brown checks is in the No. 2 position for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Corey Lipscomb (No. 3 singles) and sophomore Albab Ahmad, who sometimes takes on the fourth single slot, rounded out the top four for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Double pairs have come in the form of Shawn’D Gonzalez and Alex Huntley, Joe Cavanaugh and Austin Chartier along with Nick Nadeau and Ahmed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s 4-3 loss at Plainville on May 17 was a close call as the Lancers won three of four singles bouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Blue Devils earned the sweep over doubles play to tennis meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern pulled out victories in the top three singles matches, starting with&nbsp;Michaud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaud defeated Eli Benoit by set scores of 6-3 and 6-0&nbsp;while at No. 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown was a winner again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nearly shutout&nbsp;Middletown’s&nbsp;Eryk Kaputa in straight sets (6-0, 6-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Lipscomb was able to hold off Plainville’s Jack McDermott at the No. 3 singles slot by identical 6-1 scores for the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not an easy sport at the scholastic level but the Eastern squad, coached by Logan Bourke, has been making gains throughout the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The student athletes have put in the work and despite the record, the Lancers have competed throughout the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the results from Eastern’s home match against Middletown, resulting in a 6-1 triumph, while falling to Plainville by one last Wednesday.</p>
