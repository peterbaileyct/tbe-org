<p>BRISTOL - The train keeps rolling for the Bristol Central boys basketball team and on Thursday night, Windsor got run over by the Rams one more time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, All-World center Donovan Clingan put himself into the Bristol scholastic records book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind a school record 51 points, Clingan and Central passed yet another test - sinking No. 5 Windsor by an 83-67 final from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undefeated Central moved to 16-0 overall and has won a school record 31 straight games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan just missed out on a triple-double but the senior’s double-double was of epic proportions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with his 51 points, Clingan posted 31 rebounds and nine blocks as the big man played nearly the entire game - keeping pesky Windsor (12-3) at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 51 points was just one point off the city single-game scoring record held by Mark Noon who dumped 52 points against Prince Tech in 1974.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the scoring onslaught, Clingan now averages 29.6 points-per-game and is a couple three-point shots away from netting 1,900 for his career.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa notched a career-high 12 points, Damion Glasper added 10 while Steven Alseph netted five to pace the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After blasting Bulkeley (1-16) for 106 points in its previous game, basketball karma caught up with Windsor as the squad was limited to just 67 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Betsey scored 19 points while Prince Samuel added 12 to lead the Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this contest wasn’t any kind of push over as Windsor netted the first seven points of the game and led 11-7 with 4:12 remaining in the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central took the lead for good off a 12-3 burst as Clingan scored twice, Rosa made a steal for a hoop and then blasted in a 3 and when Glasper hit a wrap-around at the basket - plus a foul - the Rams were in charge at 19-14 with 33.6 seconds left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opened the second quarter, leading 19-17, with a 9-0 push as Alseph mixed in a lay-up and when Jayeson VanBeveren blasted home a big three-point bomb with 4:50 before the half, the Rams were on top by a 28-17 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor trimmed the deficit to single-digits moments later but both program made runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan scored three straight hoops, Windsor then canned consecutive 3s before Central used an 8-0 jaunt - highlighted by steals and hoops by Rosa and Glasper - and with 1:27 before intermission, the Rams’ 42-25 cushion was the largest of the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central held a 42-28 lead at the break and never let that cushion fall under 13 the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan dropped in 16 third period points, scoring Central’s last 10 points over the final 2:43 of the stanza, as the home team nabbed a 64-44 edge with eight minutes remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the possibility of a Windsor comeback, Clingan played most of the fourth and final frame as his second hoop of the quarter made it a 68-48 game with 6:45 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An 8-2 burst by Windsor, including a trifecta by Rashawn Tibby, trimmed the deficit to 70-56 with 4:35 left but the home team had a loud response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Clingan dunk, backed by a 3 from Alseph, pushed the Warriors’ deficit back out to 19 at 75-56 with 3:35 to go and the only thing left was for Central’s big man to put together another scoring record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His dunk with 1:44 remaining gave him 49 points and with 56.5 seconds left, Carson Rivoira found Clingan for his basket that led to his 50th and 51st point - leading to an 83-67 victory in the end and another school record.</p>
