<p>Early Sunday morning a water main burst on Farmington Avenue, creating a river of water flowing down the avenue from a source somewhere near Page Avenue and Vanderbilt Road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of 4 p.m., the Water Department was still searching for the source of the break. A large hole was dug up near Page Avenue with water being pumped from the hole, but the source is farther up the avenue and more digging will probably be necessary.</p>

<p>Traffic going down Farmington Avenue toward Bristol Plaza was detoured on to Page Avenue and then Moody Street. Traffic heading up Farmington Avenue was able to proceed without a detour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Water Department provided the following information on their website.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Customers on Farmington Avenue and surrounding areas may experience periods of low or no water pressure. &nbsp;When the water is turned back on you may experience some discolored water. If you experience discolored water, please run an outside faucet or bathtub until the water clears with COLD water only.</h6>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">A&nbsp;<a></a>water filling station is located at the Water Filtration Plant and is available to any customers who are affected by an extended service interruption 24 hours a day / 7 days a week. There is no charge to customers affected by the water service interruption. Customers will need to bring their own containers and Filtration Plant Operators will assist in filling them. The Water Filtration Plant is located at 1080 Terryville Avenue and the number to the plant is (860) 583-6504. It would be appreciated if customers could call the plant in advance of arrival. Crews will stay on-site until water is restored.</h6>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
