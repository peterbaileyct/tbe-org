<p>The Bristol Central softball team moved on to the semifinal round of the CCC Tournament on Tuesday, posting a 3-0 upset against No. 4 Hall from West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win by the fifth ranked Rams avenged a 2-1 regular season loss to Hall back on April 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively for Central, Sarah Romano nabbed a huge two RBI hit in the top of the seventh for a little insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other side of the bracket, Southington was the only top seed to win its game as the top-ranked Knights defeated No. 8 Avon 8-2 to advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant seeds 2-4 were all eliminated from CCC Tournament play, including Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 6 Enfield snuck past No. 3 RHAM by a 5-4 final and in the true upset of the evening,</p>

<p>No. 7 Maloney defeated No. 2 Glastonbury 8-7 over 11 innings grueling innings on the road.</p>
