<p>The following announcement was provided by BPRYCS:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services&nbsp;(BPRYCS)&nbsp;will be hosting a community planting day at Memorial Boulevard on Saturday, November 5, 2022 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.. Volunteers are invited to join BPRYCS staff&nbsp;to plant&nbsp;over forty native and naturalized shrubs in the new urban garden being planted on site.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This community planting day is part of a grant received by BPRYCS in order to remove 24,000 square feet&nbsp;of blighted tennis courts and replace them with tree and understory&nbsp;plants. &nbsp;The Urban Garden includes the addition of twenty-one native trees and over forty shrubs that will infiltrate storm water, improve air quality, and reduce ambient temperatures for this section of the city.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project was made possible by a grant through the CT Urban Forest Council provided by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Division of Forestry and funded by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Urban forests are a critical component to healthy urban and suburban communities,”&nbsp;explained Sarah Larson, Deputy Superintendent of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services, “Our department is excited to be able to invite the community to become stewards of this space and contribute to the beauty and ecological productivity of our community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This clean-up will be led by BPRYCS&nbsp;Landscape Gardener Steven Schriver and Deputy Superintendent Sarah Larson and will include information about urban forests and the ecological benefits the Memorial Boulevard Urban Garden provides.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Prior gardening experience is not necessary in order to volunteer,”&nbsp;noted Schriver. “We encourage people to bring gardening gloves and shovels, if possible, but will also have supplies on site.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volunteers are&nbsp;asked&nbsp;to park at the South Street parking lot or off of&nbsp;Wozenski&nbsp;Way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
