The deadline for voting is Wednesday, July 19,at 5 p.m. All voting is conducted online via the Parks Project Portal at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.BristolRec.com" target="_blank">www.Bristolrec.com</a> and its Upgrade Your Play page for Seymour Park.</p>

<p>One of the designs features castle and ship theme, while the other includes three climbing towers, according to a BPRYCS release earlier this week. The designs are geared towards children ages 2 to 12 and include elevated and ground level accessible swings, slides and benches.</p>

<p>The voting process continues a Parks initiative that began in 2022 with department's Upgrade Your Play<br>campaign, said BPRYCS Superintendent, Dr. Joshua Medeiros, in the release. </p>

<p>The campaign, which engages the community in decision making, began with the addition of swings at Federal Hill Green, and continued with improvements at E.G. Stocks Playground and Casey Field.</p>

<p>Over 2,000 community members voted for the design for E.G. Stocks Playground off Middle Street, BPRYCS community engagement coordinator Erica Benoit said, also, in the release. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier on in the planning, Seymour Park was identified as a priority by residents, Benoit said. The children's playground is the next phase. Improvements have already begun. The first pickleball courts and a resurfaced basketball court have been completed. </p>

<p>Funding for the playground is allocated from the General Fund and Capitol Improvement funds.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
