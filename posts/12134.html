<p>The Connecticut High School Coaches Association just released its boys basketball all-state teams for the 2021-22 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol Central’s Donovan Clingan heads the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan helped spur the Rams undefeated season as the program went 28-0 overall, captured the CCC South and CCC Tournament championships and then made it a clean sweep with a Division II state championship – earning the No. 1 seed along the way of that title run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program will continue its 43-game winning streak into the 2022-23 season, one of the longest current streaks in all the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally being allowed to play a complete season due to COVID restrictions being lifted, the 7-foot-2 Clingan started all 28 games for Central, pumping in 847 points for an average of 30.3 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big man also averaged 18 rebounds, three assists, and just around six blocked shots-per-game over a busy campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, Clingan helped the program go 4-0 in CCC Tournament play and then mirrored that in Division II tournament games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scored a school record 51 points on February 10 against Windsor in Central’s 83-67 victory over the Warriors and dropped in 45 points and 23 rebounds in the Rams’ 63-56 clinching CCC Tournament win over Northwest Catholic on March 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the CIAC Division II championship game from the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Clingan was easily the MVP of the showdown as he toasted Northwest for 25 points and 24 rebounds over Central’s 56-36 triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the way of a brilliant scholastic career, Clingan showed his ever-improving outside touch as he hit a career-high 10 three-pointers over his final season – dropping in 16 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 86 career games at Central, Clingan scored 2,268 points – the seventh most in state history – for an average of 26.4 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The center hit 101 free throws this year and has cashed in on 350 career charity shots over his four scholastic seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan has been collecting all sorts of awards over the year including CCC South All-Conference honors and is a two-time Gatorade Connecticut state Player of the Year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eleven players made the Division II All-State team including Northwest Catholic’s Matt Curtis and Conard’s sophomore sensation Riley Fox.</p>
