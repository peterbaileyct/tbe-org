<p>BRISTOL - To open the 2022 campaign, the Bristol Eastern boys soccer outfit immediately hit the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday night, the Lancers nabbed a huge 2-1 victory against&nbsp; Lewis Mills from Alumni Field in Bristol in a CCC South entanglement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the opener for both squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After falling behind by a goal, the Kingstreeters struck right back as the combination of Tyler Borry and Connor Policarpio notched the go-ahead and game-winning goals to ice the Spartans over second half play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the visiting aggression got on the board first as Ian Nanowski helped Mills tally an early score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Begert sent a long ball into the Eastern penalty area as players from both teams were in the vicinity to make a move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nanowski was the quickest to the ball, gathered it and blasted in a goal just 15 minutes into the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers’ defense did not allow another score and on flip side, Eastern’s offense slowly began to heat up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slick crosses by Cody Greger and Rio Fernandez led to over half-a-dozen good scoring chances but Mills’ keeper Cooper Martinotti (four saves) made several big stops to keep the home team scoreless over the first forty minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a 1-0 match at the half but Eastern was about to turn the tables on the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps a fiery halftime speech by the Eastern coaching staff helped fuel the Lancers over the final forty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"At halftime, the coaches challenged the players to win more 1v1 battles and concentrate on their shots," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "Our backs had done a creditable job, but we needed the offense to pick up its pace. Tonight, two captains, Ty Borry and Connor Policarpio led the way."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers continued to push the pace in the second half and were rewarded just eight minutes in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s first goal came as Sam LaMar won a ball just over half field and played it to a cutting Eddie Ansah. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah beat his man and sent a cross to Ty Borry who drilled a shot past Mills' second goalie Marek Nardi (four saves) as the match was all knotted up at 1-1 with thirty-two minutes remaining. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight minutes later, Policarpio scored the game winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borry found Policarpio on the left side, and he made his move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Policarpio cut inside his man and planted a ball past the sliding keeper as the go-ahead goal gave the Lancers a 2-1 push and the eventual victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads extended great efforts though the game was stopped a few times as coaches tended to players cramping up on the turf over a hot September day. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There was no lack of effort by either side right to the end," said Sweet.&nbsp; "In the second half, we were able to spread the field and isolate some of our players and on the defensive end we limited Mills' ability to link passes together." &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern goalie Peyton Cummings made four saves for the winners while Lewis Mills combined for eight between the two keepers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers outshot Mills by a two-to-one margin (12-6). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s next match is on the road in Berlin this Tuesday at 6 p.m.</p>
