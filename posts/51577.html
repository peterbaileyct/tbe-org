<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The late Thomas, Sr, Lorenzetti and family</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I first met former St. Anthony’s basketball player Tom Lorenzetti, Jr. when his son, by the same name, played for the Forestville Little League Red Sox during the 1980’s with my son, Jamie. Tom, Jr. is a great guy whose father was a decorated WWII hero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This veteran was a quiet, non-bragging fellow, who loved and supported his family through the years. I thought that we should recall him once again, not to be forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your service, Thomas Lorenzetti, Sr.</p>

<p><strong>Maxine Marinelli -- age 96</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can recall all the times a group of us went to Marinell’s Supper Club. Good friends and tasty food. Maxine was the hostess with the "mostest," and everyone loved her. Thank you, Maxine, your husband Nick, and your “kids” for wonderful evenings.</p>

<p><strong>Shout outs</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saying hello to folks I haven’t seen in some time -- Joan Barney, Bill Lozito, Gerry Kendall, Terry Parker, George Cowles, Tim Driscoll, Chip Mendella and Ken Samele.</p>

<p><strong>Streets</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lillian Road was named after Lillian Morrison in 1953: Lincoln Avenue was once named Hen Coop Alley, and then changed to honor President Abe Lincoln; Wolcott Street was once known as Coghill.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ray Ouellette</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve known Ray since grammar school at Stafford and have seen him grow as a good man since. He’s served as a U.S. Marine in Vietnam, has been a successful businessman, and in more recent years, has been a happy husband.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A close friend to the late, great Art Ward, he has made his family proud of his endeavors with the best of Bristol. Semper Fi, Ray!</p>
