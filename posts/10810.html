<p>MIDDLETOWN - The Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern wrestling squads were involved in the competitive Colter Abeley Tournament on Saturday - battling some of the state’s toughest programs while also seeing teams from Rhode Island and Massachusetts - getting an extra dose of competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers led the locals with 63 points - placing 12th overall - while the Rams ended up 15th behind a thirty-two-point showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier (234½ points) won its own event, getting by runner-up Simsbury (212½).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bishop Hendricken (205) from Rhode Island nabbed third place, Guilford (146) took fourth while Trumbull (124) earned fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were involved with one championship bout at 160 pounds as Alex Marshall made it to the finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that first-place showdown, Ridgefield’s Andrey Kogygin tallied just one point as Marshall fell in the end via a 1-0 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another tremendous showing by the football standout, but he wasn’t the only Eastern grappler that made it to the medal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Dylan Piazza battled to the consolation round of 182 pounds but Marcus Tucci of Burlington, Massachusetts ended up taking the match via forfeit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in the third-place bout at 138, Central’s Landon Dionne fell to Dylan Levesque of Xavier by a 13-5 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all the weekend festivities, both Central and Eastern have a busy week coming up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams hit the road to battle Platt in Meriden on Wednesday at 6 p.m. while on the flip side, Eastern squares off against Berlin from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or, according to a scheduling quirk on the CIAC website, Berlin will compete against Eastern from the Fisher Meadow Softball Fields - in Avon at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If that’s the case, and the Lancers and Redcoats travel to Avon, bring your coats, hats, mittens, and your flashlights for an outdoor wrestling extravaganza (go to Bristol Eastern that night please…).</p>
