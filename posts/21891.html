<p>BRISTOL - This past Wednesday, the Bristol Eastern wrestling team nearly earned its first CCC South victory of the campaign but just missed its shot against a quality Maloney squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers dropped a tough five-point decision to the Spartans, falling by a 41-36 decision from the Thomas M. Monaghan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney (10-4) ended up losing a point due to a 'wardrobe malfunction’ which could have made a difference if the meet ended up a bit closer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 3-4 overall and 0-1 in CCC South competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans, now 2-1 in the CCC South, had to hold on because the Kingstreeters put up a good fight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Brown (106 pounds) ended up winning when Maloney did not have a grappler to compete against at that weight while Yussuf Bah (113) ended up pinning Jeremiah Rodriguez in only 1:18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grinder Luke Viens (120) earned a pinfall victory against Maloney’s Nicholas Rodriguez in 2:29 while at 152, Eastern’s Rocco Barbino nabbed a pin over Saleem Saleh in under a minute on the mats (1:09).</p>

<p>Eastern’s stud Adam Zavecz (182) rolled Moises Hernandez in just 21 seconds, winning via pinfall, while at 195, fellow junior Owen Broyles pinned Deshaun Williams in 3:19.</p>

<p>The Lancers are back to work on Wednesday with an encounter against Platt in Meriden.</p>
