<p>BRISTOL – The Plainville and Lewis Mills cross country programs had to tackle the trail over at Page Park on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant the programs from Bristol Eastern were in CCC South action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had a good day on their own turf as the girls split against the Blue Devils and Blue Dragons. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters picked up a 28-31 victory over Middletown while falling to a very good Plainville program, 18-45.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s top seven made several quality finishes as Kaelyn Gonzalez, a tremendous sophomore competitor, nabbed fourth place to lead the field for the locals. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“[The] Bristol Eastern girls lost to an incredibly talented Plainville team, but toughened up against Middletown for the win,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “Our girls team was down a few runners today, but the rest of the team stepped up in a big way. Kaelyn Gonzalez led the ladies with an overall&nbsp;place of fourth. Kam Meyer, Lauren Ayotte, Rita Gao, Princess Priscilla Dilone, Isabel Bray, and Brooklynne Whitlock rounded out the top 7 with strong performances.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Nice job ladies!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s boys also went 1-1 on the afternoon, falling to the best squad in the CCC South in the form of Plainville.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase McNamara led the Blue Devils to the victory, but the Lancers had several good performances from the hilly course.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Jase Loczur was the runner-up at the event and ran well over a tough field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The boys put up a fight today against some tough competition,” said&nbsp;Ryskowski. “The boys win against Middletown and come up just short against Plainville. Jase Koczur continues to run tough. He placed second overall. He was backed by Brendan Tartarelli, Cole Beland, Kyle Kelley, Aidan Gezelman, Jonathan Casarola, and Szymon Winiarczyk.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nice job, boys!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has a couple of big events over the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters will make up part of the field of the Harry Geraghty Invite on Friday, September 29 from Nevers Road Park at 4 p.m. while the Lancers open the month of October with another CCC south tri-meet bout.&nbsp;</p>
