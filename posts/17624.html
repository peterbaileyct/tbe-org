<p>BRISTOL - After scooping up a huge 6-0 win at Platt last Thursday, the Bristol Eastern girls soccer team returned home to take on the other program from Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Tuesday afternoon, the Lancers ended up playing Maloney to a 1-1 stalemate in a CCC South bout from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 1-3-2 overall while the Spartans moved to 1-4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern coach Scott Redman noted that the showdown was a chippy and physical affair as both sides left it all on the turf over eighty minutes of scholastic ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both sides had a chance to win the match as the Kingstreeters scored the first goal of the engagement eighteen minutes into the fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To set up the scoring drive, Eastern’s Megan Krok played a ball back to Julia Armington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior then made a great pass to Emma Stavens who turned and lofted a perfect shot over the Maloney keeper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball was placed in no-man’s land, way out of the reach of the keeper, as the ball fell in - propelling the Lancers to an early 1-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That advantage held into the half as Eastern was able to seize that one-score edge despite only attempting just the lone shot on goal all game long.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, quickly into the second forty, Maloney made its early scoring chance count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a corner kick by the Spartans, the Lancers had multiple chances to clear the ball out, but it ended up at the feet of Maloney’s Molly Marcuss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She popped the ball into the far corner of the Eastern goal to knot things up at 1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the visiting aggression could not get another ball by Eastern keeper Abigale Pelletier (five saves) as the outstanding goalie and the Eastern defense held the fort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both teams had some chances but not anything of high quality,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Maloney had more shots but many from distance that didn't test Pelletier.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs couldn’t score the rest of the way as the programs ended the affair in a 1-1 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leah Roy and Taigan Parent played sensationally on defense for the Lancers,” said Redman. “Cecelia Gilbert and Emma Stavens were extremely physical and played very well in the midfield."</p>
