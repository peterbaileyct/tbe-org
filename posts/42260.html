<p>Patriots' Day has its roots in the Battle of Lexington and Concord which occurred on April 19, 1775. It was “The Shot Heard Round the World”, written by poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the first battle that started the American Revolutionary War, paving the country's path to freedom. </p>

<p>Patriots' Day became an official holiday in Connecticut as of July 10, 2017, when Connecticut joined Maine, Massachusetts and Wisconsin in celebrating the holiday.<br>  <br>2018 saw Bristol’s first celebration of Patriots' Day. The Wernicki family became involved in Patriots'’ Day as “a way to recognize veterans who continued to make a difference after they completed their service,” according to the release, and as a way to honor the veterans who have given so much to the Bristol community. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
