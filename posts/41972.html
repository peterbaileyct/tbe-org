<p>Bristol Eastern outscored Amity 14-4 in the fourth quarter to pull away to a 38-27 win Friday night at the Lancer gym.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was never an offensive showcase for either team. There was a seeming plague of turnovers and missed shots, and nerves had the upper hand on execution.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, after exploding for 19 points in the first four minutes of their previous game, had only 14 at the half, including a measly three in the second quarter. There was a generous mixture of air balls and in-and-outs. But with all their offensive struggles, Eastern was only down by three at halftime, 17-14.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer for the Lancers in the second half came in an incredible defensive effort, holding Amity to 10 points over the final 16 minutes. They hounded Amityâ€™s three point shooters and got all the key rebounds. </p>

<p>The last four minutes of the game were dominated by Eastern, led by Autumn Udoh and Vanessa Drury. Udoh led the team with 13 points, Drury added 7, and Amanda Noel and Cassie Sward each chipped in with 6.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final score certainly does not reflect the closeness of the contest, and Eastern will need an improved offense to compete against their next opponent.</p>

<p>The Lancers advance to the quarterfinals of the tournament on Tuesday night. They travel to Waterbury to face #1 seed Holy Cross at 7:00.<br></p>

This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
