<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central boys outdoor track and field team dominated the annual city series meet against Bristol Eastern on Tuesday afternoon, scooping up an impressive 101-49 victory from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was sixth meet this season in which the Rams (7-0) squared up at least 100 points and even down a couple prime time performers against the Lancers, Central was able to collect first place finishes in 14 of the 18 events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We always want to come out here and have a great performance in what is the city meet for us,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “We were missing a few of our top guys. Victor [Rosa] wasn’t with us this week [and] Jarrett [Boxley] is a little banged up. So I told the boys we’re not going to dwell on that. We’re going to have other people step up and they did, they really did.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankie Porrini absolutely dominated over his usual three events, pacing himself brilliantly before sprinting to victory – especially in the one and two mile challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the 800 meters with a remarkable time of 1:57.98, took the 1600 in 4:42 – able to fend off pesky Logan Crowley from Eastern (second place, 4:52), and then in the 3200, the duo went at it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was the Porrini (10:20) who topped Crowley (10:44) for another win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And along those lines, Central’s Noah Conrod won four events – winning the 100 meters (11.22 seconds), 200 (23.51), 400 (52.21), and made-up part of the winning 4x100 relay team as the sprinter had quite a day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tre Blair topped the field in both the long jump (19 feet, 2.25 inches) and didn’t have the cleanest leap in the triple jump when he won with a make of 43 feet, 8.75 inches – easily taking both events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan Lauretti seized first place in both the javelin (130 feet, eight inches) and the discus (127 feet, six inches), Logan Jackson took the 300 hurdles (45.6 seconds), and Malachi Jones won the shot put (45 feet, eight inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s combination of Cassias Breland, Conrod, Logan Jackson, and Anthony Paulino won the 4x100 in 44.98 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paulino also won the high jump with a leap of five feet, six inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Lancers, Carter Harris and Crowley performed extremely well over several events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 4x800 relay team of Crowley, Dominic Tartarelli, Aidan Tartarelli, and Harris won the race in 9:32 while Harris cleared 10 feet in the pole vault to win it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 4x400 relay, Eastern won in 3:36.9 as the combination of Jack Mulcunry, Dante Marciano, Edward Ansah, and Harris all performed well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with Crowley’s runner-up finishes in the 1600 and 3200 meters, Harris drew second place in the 800 with a stellar time of 2:05.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve been great for us the entire season,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski of Carter and Harris. “Obviously, it’s my first year of coaching over here and I don’t know what I would do without those two. They’ve been incredible since day one. They’re great leaders. Great role models.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They lead with their voice but also by example.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Josh Moore won the 110 hurdles in 17.31 seconds, Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum earned second place in the triple jump (40 feet, three inches) and third in the long jump (17 feet, 9.5 inches) while Jaiden Fore was the runner up in the javelin (115 feet, five inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the duo of Mulcunry and Marciano took second and third place, respectively, in the 200 and 400 meter events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Central, Paulino nabbed second place in the long jump (18-4), Breland was the runner-up in the 100 meters (11.67 seconds), while Jude Browning placed second in the pole vault (nine feet).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also earning second place tallies for the Rams were Ashton Zabka (shot put, 44-3.5), Jackson (110 hurdles, 18.73 seconds), Jones (discus, 121-0.5), Rowan Hennessey (high jump, 5-2), and Tristian Toussaint (300 hurdles, 48.27 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‘I’m proud of this team,” said Stafford-Kirk of her troops. “Today really showed our depth and it showcased some of our younger kids too. We’ll lose [those seniors] after next year, but we’ll be back fighting again. I think we proved that today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern would love to duplicate that kind of success Central enjoys each and every season since Stafford has taken over the program as head coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve been [successful] for two decades,” said&nbsp;Ryskowski&nbsp;of Central. “That type of success isn’t an accident. They’ve got great coaching, they’ve got a great culture and that’s the goal for us at Eastern.”</p>
