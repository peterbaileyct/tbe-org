<p>In the bottom of the 3rd, St. Paul broke the game wide open. Mario Izzo led off with a single. Casey Cerruto followed with a double, putting two men in scoring position. Tonnotti was again up to the task and drove both of them in with a 2 run single. Steve Morelli was up next and walked to put 2 on. Jonathan Remillard hit an RBI single driving in Tonnotti, and Cal Chance had an RBI single driving in Morelli. Devin Kulas reached on an infield error to load the bases. After a wild pitch allowed Remillard to score, Ryan Daniels walked to reload the bases. Izzo was hit by a pitch forcing in a run, and Cerruto walked forcing in another. Then Tonnotti reached on an infield error that allowed another run to score. Morelli had the final RBI on a fielder's choice, and the Falcons had removed any doubt about the afternoon’s outcome. The nine run inning stretched the lead to 12-1.</p>
