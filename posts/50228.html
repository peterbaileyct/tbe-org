<p>Music buzzes and crowds gather as the smell of food fills the air during the Showtime Music Festival curated by AC203 earlier in August.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Casper a.k.a. AC203 hosted the event at Muzzy Field on Aug. 10 from 1-10 p.m. with 38 artists, three food trucks and 18 vendors, including his own brand, Aboves Garden.</p>

<p>“I feel like a lot of people got to network,” he said. “I feel like it was good for the community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Casper said he wanted to help artists and vendors alike to build a platform for their brand and to help them gain experience.</p>

<p>“I also had a 12-year-old girl perform this year,” he said. “The youth artist has been a regular at my studio that I own in Wolcott and I wanted to give her a chance to get an experience of performing since she has been working hard all summer recording music with her family.”</p>

<p>Casper owns Steezys Recording Studio alongside his clothing brand and is present on social media and has a website.</p>

<p>“Everybody was telling me they had a great time,” he said. “Everybody was rocking with it. Like they were excited, they were asking me when was the next one [and] I was telling them it’s next year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Casper said apart from the vendors and music there were blow-up carnival games, a raffle, and other activities for children such as balloon artists, face painting and a magician.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m very proud of the outcome,” Casper said. “I feel like it was a success.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
