<p>Saturday, under a bright blue sky, nearly 30 people gathered at Old North Cemetery on Lewis Street for Wreaths Across America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I've had to sit through history classes too like everyone else," said Andrew Collins, who showed up for the event on Saturday, Dec. 17. "I hear all the stories about the sacrifices people like these have made. We need to appreciate them."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins doesn't have any members of his immediate family in the armed forces, but his grandfather served in the Air Force for 20 years. He heard about Wreaths Across America last year for the first time. He came back again this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm always going to the Memorial Day veterans' days event, so coming to this last year was no question for me," he said, "and when I heard they're doing the same thing this year I wanted to come again."</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the laying of the wreath, Collins as well as the other participants were instructed by the regent of the local Katherine Gaylord Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution Deborah Dupre Norris, to pause at the gravesite, speak out loud the name of the veteran, place the wreath and step back and thank the veterans for their service and pause for a moment of reflection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dupre-Norris led the ceremony, which included introductory comments, a wreath ceremony where members from each of the different branches of the services pinned flags to wreaths along the fence surrounding the cemetery, an official blessing of the wreaths and the playing of Taps prior to the laying of wreaths at the gravesites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A POW/MIA wreath was placed by Bob Barrnet in memory of his brother, a Korean War POW who died in a POW Camp. The American Legion, Post 2, portable POW/MIA Table was on hand for the event. American Legion, Post 2 Honor Guard was played Taps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank you for joining us today as we celebrate the mission to remember the fallen, honor those who have served and their families, and teach the next generation the value of freedom,” Dupre-Norris told the gathered crowd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The annual event, which was founded in 2007 to continue and expand the annual wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, begun by Maine wreath maker Morrill Worcester in 1992, is held on the Saturday before Christmas. This year, approximately 2.9 million wreaths were laid at 4,200 national cemeteries throughout the nation.</p>

<p>In Bristol, this is the second consecutive year the event was held at the Old North Cemetery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A little after 12 noon, the ceremony began near the cemetery entrance, where remembrance wreaths were hung along a fence honoring each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Prisoners of War, Missing in Action, and the Public Health Services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Volunteers then went out about placing 41 wreaths. For headstones, the wreaths were leaned on the headstones, so the red bow was at 12 o'clock. For a flat stone, it was placed on the stone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Collins the event is one that he makes time for and will continue to make time for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I just think it's important that we always remember," he said.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
