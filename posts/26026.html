<p>Woodland scored the first runs of the game in the bottom of the third inning. With one out, back-to-back walks to Darren Gasparri and Tyler DeCrescenzo put two men on, and a successful double steal put them both in scoring position. A single by Ethan Stepputtis should have scored one, but the ball was bobbled in the outfield and both Gasparri and DeCrescenzo scored.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 4th, Woodlandâ€™s Cayden O'Neil singled and advanced to second when Erik Pulkkinen walked. Gasparri singled off reliever Tyler Kiluk driving in O'Neil, and Woodland led 3-0.</p>

<p>Three of St. Paul's hits and all of its runs came in the top of the 5th inning. Jonathan Remillard singled to lead off the inning. After one out, Keaton Kroll singled to put two men on. Then with two outs, Jamie Leggett drove a double to the left field fence scoring two and cutting Woodland's lead down to 3-2. <br>But that was the last hit St Paul would have on the day, and the final score was 3-2.</p>
