<p>Good morning, Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We made it to Thursday and Sept. 1 with little to no fanfare, so congratulations to us!</p>

<h3>Helpful Hints:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weekend and for the foreseeable future, we will have sunny weather and temps in the 80s. While drivers make their appointed rounds, watch out for cyclists, be patient, and pass with care while sharing the road.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for cyclists, wear a helmet, make yourself visible and ride predictably, responsibly, and use hand signals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By doing so, we can all meet back here next week.</p>

<h3>Water Department:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Effective Sept. 2 (Friday), the drive-up window at the Bristol Water and Sewer Department, located at 119 Riverside Ave., will be closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The closure, due to an upgrade, will enhance efficiencies. Construction is expected to be completed by Oct. 28. The lobby, however, will remain open while work is done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who out there mentioned payment options? Well, here they are as follows:</p>

<h3>Bristol Trivia Question:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One might be the loneliest number, but number 2 gets no love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone with a pulse knows that Jeffrey Caggiano is Bristol’s current mayor, Ellen Zoppo was our previous mayor, and James F. Wade was the first mayor. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s trivia question: Who was Bristol’s second mayor?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Answer Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See you then, people!</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em></p>
