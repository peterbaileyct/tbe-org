<p>Who else could be the number one ranked scholastic boys basketball team to end the 2021-22 season other than the squad from Bristol Central, a program that hasn’t lost a game in over two years?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the leading poll in the state, GameTimeCT, answered that question as the Rams ended the final standings as the top ranked team in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all the votes were tabulated, Central (28-0) was ranked No. 1 – tallying all 570 votes after knocking off Northwest Catholic on Saturday, 56-36, from Uncasville last Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was the top-rated squad the entire year, going wire-to-wire in that position in the poll, and last season’s final tally had the Rams at number one as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program are winners of 43 straight games which continues to be the longest streak in Connecticut and will be to open the 2022-23 scholastic season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions (25-3) were ranked second coming into the Division II championship game but after that 20-point defeat, there’s a new No. 2 team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Division I champ East Catholic (20-6 overall, 512 points) slotted into the second place to end the year while Northwest (492 points) ended up in third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant three squads from the Central Connecticut Conference ended up in the top three places of the final GameTimeCT poll which is one heck of a finish – like last year’s final rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notre Dame-West Haven (25-2, 458) earned fourth place, Hand (23-4, 388) won the Division III championship and took fifth while Windsor (20-5, 368) ended up sixth – making it four of the top six ranked squads belonging to the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In seventh place was Fairfield Prep (22-4, 311), Division IV champs Bloomfield (21-5, 259), another prime example of the dominance from the CCC, earned eighth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kolbe Cathedral (22-4, 237) finished up in ninth place and rounding off the top-10 was Wilton (21-5, 198), one of two teams that took Bristol Central to overtime this year along with Wilbur Cross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Central went 6-0 this season against the final GameTimeCT Top-10 teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Falling out of the top 10 in the final poll included Naugatuck (23-1) and Ridgefield (22-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard earned votes as well, ending up in 14<sup>th</sup> place with 132 points off its sterling 22-4 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilbur Cross, behind 31 votes, finished in 20<sup>th</sup> place. &nbsp;</p>
