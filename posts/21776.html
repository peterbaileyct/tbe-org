<p>NEW LONDON – When former Bristol Eastern boys basketball standout Elijah Parent was thinking about his collegiate future, he knew he wanted to continue playing the sport.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he also found an opportunity to serve his country as well all while being able to learn a trade that will help his career in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coast Guard checked off all those boxes for the highly intelligent young man and the combo guard is a thriving contributor for the men’s basketball team in New London.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot-2, 175 lb. freshman has made several starts for the Bears, getting a ton of playing time as a first year player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the season, Parent is averaging 5.6 points and 2.4 rebounds-per-game while hitting just around 30-percent of his three-point attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After not playing against Eastern Connecticut in the Coast Guard’s opener back on November 3, it’s been hard to keep Parent out of the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started five consecutive games in November, was coming off the pine to start December before getting back into the starting lineup in three of the Bears’ last five games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his past two starts, Parent has dropped in 10.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals-per-game – playing in 71 of a possible 80 minutes to lead the team</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent and the Bears went to war against Emerson this past Monday in what turned into a tight 40-minute battle of attrition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent had a tremendous showing, dropping in a team-high 14 points that included two makes from downtown – to no one’s surprise – while capturing five rebounds, dishing out about half-a-dozen assists, swiped two steals and even blocked a shot over a team-leading 34 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coast Guard just couldn’t get over the hump as Emerson snuck out an 81-76 victory from New London.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent drained a 3 early in the showdown to trim the deficit to 5-3 but the Lions always seemed to be one step ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But his slick lay-up with 12:17 left before halftime allotted Coast Guard a slim 24-21 advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emerson ended the half on a 20-9 burst and after twenty minutes of play, the Bears trailed by eight (41-33).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That deficit trickled to about 13 before Parent and the Bears made a bit of a run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent splashed in an NBA range 3 with 12:57 left in regulation as the former Bristol Eastern sharpshooter made it a two-possession game at 53-47.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deficit reached double-figures again (67-57) with 6:18 to play and the Lions were still ahead by nine with 2:38 left.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one final run was in the works by the Bears and when Parent found Trevor Parks (nine points) for a big three-point bomb, the home team was in it, down just 77-74 with 46.7 seconds remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Emerson took the air out of the ball, made good on free throw opportunities due to the Bears fouling late, and in the end, the Guard Coast lost a hard-fought 81-76 decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Wednesday, the Bears were in action against MIT, drawing a tough 70-68 loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent started again, contributing seven points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals over a team best 37 minutes of court time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the loss, Coast Guard fell to 3-11 overall and 1-2 in NEWMAC play. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent was a tremendous player for Bristol Eastern over his four seasons, earning varsity time since his freshman year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 67 career games, bumped into by the pandemic, Parent averaged 10.6 points-per-game while scoring over 700 points for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s the all-time leader in three-pointers made at Eastern (133) and also holds the record for threes made in a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On February 11, 2020, Parent jumped Platt for a career-high 33 points which included a 7-of-10 showing from three for the school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent also drained 62-of-74 charity shots (83.8-percent), ranking among the top foul shooters in BEHS boys basketball history.</p>
