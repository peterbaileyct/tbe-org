<p>"It is often challenging work, but we can see from our survey results that our teams know why we walk in the door every morning. It is an amazing honor to lead an organization full of simply inspirational people."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2024 award follows another one from this summer where Wheeler was named a national 2024 Healthcare Industry Top Workplace, Wheeler also received special recognition for its managers in the 2024 results.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The "Top Workplace" designation is based solely on employee feedback gathered through a third-party survey administered by employee engagement technology partner Energage LLC, according to the release. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The survey uniquely measures the employee experience and its component themes, including employees feeling respected and supported, enabled to grow, empowered to execute, and more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approximately 400 Wheeler employees across the state completed the survey in the spring. </p>

<p>Among the highlights of Wheeler's results:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To "My Manager Helps Me Grow," 85 percent of Wheeler's surveyed employees agreed. The national health care benchmark was 74 percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To <strong>"Wheeler Encourages Different Points of View," </strong>74 percent of Wheeler's surveyed employees agreed. The national health care benchmark was 66 percent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Trocchi said that past "Top Workplace" surveys led to many employee-driven changes in Wheeler, from new Employee Resource Groups to different approaches to benefits and dress codes, among others. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We listen to our employees, and I believe we can see that when you listen and trust your team, great things happen," she added.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
