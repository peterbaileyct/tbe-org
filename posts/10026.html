<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - Bristol Central boys basketball coach Tim Barrette has been there and done that at the scholastic level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of his teams - with players the likes of Joey DeFillippi and Jacob Collins - had some tremendous talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And other seasons, the Rams employed studs like Daquan Brooks who played collegiately and beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those three players were some of the best ever Barrette has been able to teach, mentor, and coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the fall of 2018, a 7-footer by the name of Donovan Clingan joined the team and everything changed for Barrette and the Bristol Central program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that leads to a critical question that needs an immediate answer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Has Barrette ever seen anything like Clingan on the scholastic level?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Ever?!?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thank god every day because he’s mine” to coach said Barrette. “It’s very hard to even understand how to game-plan against him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve already observed opposing defenses attempt to defend Clingan with a plethora of defensive schemes this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And truly, nothing seems to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you triple-team the young man?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve seen that already between Central’s games against Southington and East Catholic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two double-digit wins followed for the Rams off those tactics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you speed the game up?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If ‘Big Deli’ is your center at Bristol Central, go for it and run up and down against that talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you can’t do that against Central in 2022 because Clingan can keep up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Force him outside, perhaps?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan can shoot from downtown and will make those outside attempts count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps surrender before the game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, Central won’t let you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what you face when battling the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you play in the half-court, that means you have to score against us,” said Barrette. “If you slow it down, you’ve then got to set up to play against us in the half-court and that’s not easy with a 7-foot-2 guy in the paint. If you speed it up, sometimes you get easy opportunities but at the same time, [Clingan’s] in such good shape, he’s been running the floor so well, sometimes he thrives in the open floor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re just not an easy team to game plan against because of him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You cannot win, you cannot break even, and you cannot get out of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>British scientist C.P. Snow wasn’t talking about the Laws of Thermodynamics. He was talking about Donovan Clingan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what works against Central?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing yet, leading to thirty-two minutes of misery for both Southington and East Catholic to date this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s obviously the ultimate weapon to have,” said Barrette of Clingan. “But I have not seen anyone effect the game as much as him. There’s a difference between being the best player and skilled but also effecting the game. He effects the game from the opening tap to the last play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who can you compare Clingan to, scholastically, that we’ve seen locally?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Howse did a great job as a 6-foot-8 center for Central during 1991-1994.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a decent outsider shooter and an All-State talent who ended up at the University of Hartford but was the not the force Clingan was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marcus Camby perhaps?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartford Public went 27-0 over Camby’s senior season - averaging 27 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and eight blocks-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was named Gatorade’s Connecticut Player of the year in 1993.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Camby didn’t shoot three-pointers at the scholastic level but played at a time where the five - the center position in basketball - would <em>never </em>dare shoot a 3 (think head coach John Calipari would have tolerated that at UMASS?).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But while Clingan hasn’t taken a ton of threes either, he can hit the long ball (ask Northwest Catholic that question last season) and it’s such a unique facet of his overall game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditional centers play with their backs to the basket, using turnarounds, hooks, dunks, and fallaways against opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan could do all that but he’ll also shoot the competition out of the building with range and accuracy, all while bodying up on opposing forwards and centers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“His whole body of work, he’s vastly improved,” said Barrette. “And he’s much stronger. So, the little bumps and things like that don’t bother him as much. He’ll play through a lot of contact.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the game against East Catholic last Monday, a 74-59 triumph by Central, Clingan started the game with a hook shot, nailed a running one, and then towards the tail end of the first frame, he canned a long jumper to keep his team ahead against the third rated squad in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His numbers in the victory over the Eagles included 29 points, 17 rebounds, and seven blocked shots in another man-sized effort against, once again, one of the top teams in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central had the top football player in the state in senior Victor Rosa playing for their program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ditto for boys basketball team as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There might be players that have come out of Connecticut at some point that might have been more talented or skilled but there’s not been a player out of Connecticut - I can promise you over the last thirty years - that has effected the game more than Donovan Clingan,” said Barrette.</p>
