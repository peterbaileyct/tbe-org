<p>"It is always tough competing against the larger schools in the L Division. I felt the girls represented their team and school wonderfully, said Coach Adrienne Bentley. “I was surprisingly impressed with the 15th place finishing, beating power houses like Middletown, Newington, Shelton and more!" </p>

<p>The Cordero sisters qualified and advanced in individual events, Nyomi in the 100 fly and 100 breast and Isabella in the 100 back.  Isabella won her heat in the backstroke and then got a best time split in the 400 free relay.  Nyomi had a season best time in the 100 breast and then jumped back into the water to win the heat in the 400 Free Relay with a split time of 100.49.</p>

<p> Said Coach Bentley, "We have been struggling all season, trying to find the right order and mix for this relay.  It is tough coming out of the back and breaststroke and then jumping into a sprint relay like this.  I am so proud that both Isabella and Nyomi pushed themselves and met their goals for the season and for their team."</p>
