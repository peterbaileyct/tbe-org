<p>BRISTOL - When the Bristol American Legion Senior baseball squad finally defeated NCL Windsor Locks/Windsor 7-6 from Muzzy Field on July 7, the triumph was a bit of a bittersweet victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game, taking 14 innings to complete over dates from both June and July, ended up being the final home games for Post 2 veterans Elliot Norris and Jayden Churchill.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two warriors were instrumental in Bristol’s 10-win campaign this past season, and each contributed immensely whether it was in the field or at the plate, putting runners in play, and leading the team along the way with a little veteran leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They stayed in touch with me during the offseason,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of the duo. “They’re just two great kids, just super, super guys.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two could have easily spent their summer playing elsewhere but decided to come back to the Bristol American Legion program - lending their talents to lead a multi-town grouping of players from Bristol, Farmington and Wolcott.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris used his speed to chase down any ball hit towards his shortstop position and racked up several assists every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He attacked every ball with zest, making the not-so-routine play look fairly routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when it looked like an opposing batter had eked out an infield hit, a slick throw-over by Norris to Connor Cyr at first base - or even Declan Schenck when he manned the position there a time or two - was pretty to watch from the stands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think Elliot is the best defensive shortstop we’ve ever had for me coaching because of the way he charges everything,” said LaPenta. “He never sits back.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris’s eyes were always working, and the athlete did an incredible job of knowing where to position himself once the ball was hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was always in attack mode at a position that requires a fielder who helps cue several inning-ending double plays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That took some skill and Norris had plenty of it at short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This grass at Muzzy, we’ve had plenty of little puke hits that go to shortstop, and he comes in and gets everything,” said LaPenta of Norris. “He plays a really aggressive shortstop. And when it’s hit to him, 99-percent of the time, it’s an out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also hit the ball a little bit, usually batting leadoff or close to it in Post 2’s wheelhouse at the top of the order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can bunt his way on base for hits, steal a couple bases in an instant and typically led the squad in assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that 7-6 victory against NCL, Norris went 2-for-5, walked three times, stole two bases, made three putouts and had a team-leading five assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s all in a day’s work with Norris in the trenches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve had good shortstops” over the years said LaPenta which included Evan Bouchard and Noah Plantamuro. “But everything together, he’s the best defensively. He’s not the best offensive hitter [though] he’s very fast. But as far as defense goes, if he’s not the best, he’s one of the best we’ve ever had.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After spending time with the Bristol Eastern baseball squad as an assistant coach this past spring, Churchill came back to lend his talents to the Bristol American Legion program for one final season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played a lot of baseball this summer but once he got back into the groove, Churchill’s play over the second half of the campaign was crucial in Post 2’s dash to the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jayden struggled a little bit in the beginning to get his timing back, but he hit the ball really hard,” said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill always brought the defense to centerfield but about halfway through the campaign, he improved his timing at the plate and that’s when the hits started to flow for the veteran.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 2-for-3 against Middletown on July 5 in a huge 3-2 win over one of Zone 3’s best squads and really started to get into a great rhythm over the month of July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill was 2-of-4 with an RBI in a big victory over Ridgefield and nabbed a critical hit in the state tournament game at South Windsor on July 19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was injured for most of the campaign, not allowing him to pitch like he wanted to, but along the way, Churchill was able to take the hill a time or two and provided Bristol with some memorable moments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wish his arm was a little better,” said LaPenta. “He reaggravated his shoulder [injury early in the season].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he came through in that huge 6-2 triumph over Ridgefield on the road on Sunday, July 9 at Bristol’s second game of the Stars and Stripes Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He fooled every batter he faced, gave up just four singles and by the time Ridgefield started scoring runs, it was far too late for a comeback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the kind of ability Churchill brought to each game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every team needs leaders like Norris and Churchill and the duo proved that coming back to the Bristol American Legion Baseball program was a great decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To have two kids like that, that’s why I still coach after 15 years of doing it,” said LaPenta.</p>
