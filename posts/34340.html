<p>EAST HARTFORD – This past Monday, the Bristol Eastern girls soccer team hung around with the squad from East Hartford on the road – scoring early before trailing late with ten minutes remaining in the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers notched a huge game-tying goal as Megan Krok refused to let the locals fall again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to that last-minute score, the match ended in a 2-2 stalemate against the Hornets from the soccer field at East Hartford High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 0-2-1 while Eastern Hartford finished the day at 0-3-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Krok did a tremendous job up front while Hailey Beebe – doing another bang up job in the net – scooped in five saves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ offense outshot the Hornets 8-7 and the locals scored their first goals of the season courtesy of Krok and the offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern took control of the contest towards the tail end of the first half with a slick score by Krok.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With nine minutes to play in the stanza, Eastern’s Kate Patterson and Alaina Joy put together a hockey style assist as Krok kicked in the first goal of the match – making the affair a 1-0 bout in Eastern’s favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cara Lusitani [had] a great throw into Alaina [and] crossed to Kate who passed perfectly to Megan to beat the keeper,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern still led at the half 1-0 and maintained that edge early into second period play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the home program dropped in two straight scores to steal the momentum away from the visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, East Hartford’s Meghan Moore scored on a breakaway and connected on a shot seven minutes into the second forty and then with 10 minutes to go in regulation, Nya Cohen tallied what appeared to be the go-ahead goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cohen slipped behind the Eastern defense, connecting on a score and propelled the Hornets to a 2-1 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even as time was about to elapse, the Kingstreeters were able to snare a late goal to steal away the victory from East Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Krok was at it again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Krok chipped a free kick from the sideline over the keeper's head to tie it up,” said Reman of the game-tying goal. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the final 2-2 score allowed the Lancers to notch their first point of the season, breaking a two-match losing streak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
