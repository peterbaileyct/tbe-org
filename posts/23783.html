<p>Come Sunday morning, it will have been a week since the big kids’ birthday party. Get 10 3-year-olds in a gym that is for them, with all sharp corners covered with some sort of cushion, and what do you have? Pure, unadulterated energy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Toss in the reality that these are COVID-kids, who have been somewhat sequestered until lately, and you get energy squared—something Einstein would have to figure out: Batman ladders, trampoline, treehouse slides, swinging posts&nbsp;to avoid while running the gauntlet, and, yes, even one of those ball pits, plus kids equals how much wattage, that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterwards, some pizza and cake&nbsp;and there’s a little bit of heaven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then during the week, it snows Monday into Tuesday and again Friday into Saturday. I am guessing that is the residue of the party—so much turbulence in the atmosphere. Snow means having to clear some, and even then, that turned out okay. I almost forgot how much I like that task. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I asked my students, who are mostly high school juniors and seniors, who shoveled. Of the whole, maybe five raised their hands. If you did not shovel, I asked, who did? A few said, Dad. Others got plowed out. I am still ruminating over that and what it means. Of course, there is an obvious answer, but I am thinking there is something else there that I am missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Readling/listening this week was pretty limited. Between the snow and my naps afterwards, I think I lost 10 hours. (Sure, I am exaggerating—there was not a nap on Saturday. For reading, I turned to the canon, in this instance, the American canon, and Hemingway. I picked up “For Whom the Bell Tolls.” It is a time of war, as has been the past 100 or more years. Why not pickup a novel that takes up war for its subject?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few hundred pages in and I am thinking that along with Gen. Sherman, war is hell, and Hemingway holds up, but not for the reason that I might have expected. The verdict—the Hemingway style is a bit distracting, so much so that in some places it gets in the way of the story. The story—totally riveting and well told. The characters—absorbing, even the minor ones. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the beginning, with the introduction of a young female who was “tortured” by fascist forces, Hemingway establishes his credibility—although I question how the main character, the American who is charged with exploding a bridge, deals with her. (Of course, I cannot help comparing what is happening in Ukraine, from reports of sexual abuse rendered on Ukraine’s women, to the strategic importance of bridges and the sacrifices of the soldiers.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening is another “On the Media” extra called “Brooke on the Press in Times of War.” This might make a good background for how fiction and journalism, depending on where you land, differ.

<p>During the week, look for a special TBE announcement. Mike Letendre, our prolific sports reporter, has been busy with a project. TBE is extremely excited about the result. Stay tuned. </p>

<p><em>“Come Sunday morning” is intended to be a weekly review, a recounting of the past week and an anticipation of week to come. Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
