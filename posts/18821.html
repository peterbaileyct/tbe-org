<p>The Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern volleyball programs clash one more time during the regular season play on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s already time for another main event bout between the schools and the word that best describes the two programs - and the rest of the Central Connecticut Conference for that matter - is parity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This might be an equal showdown as it gets between the two outstanding city series competitors and after an epic first match back on October 3, there’s a possibility that Eastern’s long winning streak against Central could be in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The programs are trending in different directions since that last encounter though the Kingstreeters have played an extremely tough slate of games recently while the Rams just saw its four-match winning streak halted against one of Connecticut’s best programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is another match you can’t miss and here’s what to expect between the two Bristol teams on Monday:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (10-6) at Central (12-5), CCC South Confrontation &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium (BCHS)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last showdown between the Bristol schools</strong>: The Kingstreeters defeated the Rams in four sets back on October 3. Set scores were 25-23, 25-20, 17-25, and 25-15.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Lauren Bender zipped up 23 kills and 18 digs, Adrianna Reay added nine kills while versatile Lilli Lowe nabbed five kills and five blocks against the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Brooke Valentino led her squad against the Lancers with 18 kills, Olivia Clingan posted nine kills, Sam Sklenka bumped up 24 digs and Alex Rivera – recently tallying 1,000 assists – dished off 33 assists over the four-set loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch: Bristol Eastern</strong> (Stats through the Conard match) – Bender (sr. outside hitter, 255 kills, 32 aces, 121 digs), Emily Valentine (so. libero, 53 aces, 172 digs), Reay (jr. outside hitter, 91 kills, 28 aces, 67 digs), Lowe (sr. middle hitter, 61 kills, 32 aces, 27 blocks), Alyssa Valentine (sr. setter/defense, 26 aces), Gabby Caucci (jr. right side, 65 kills, 37 aces, 101 digs), Jenya Hatcher (jr. middle hitter, 16 kills), Andrea Martir-Perez (jr, defense, 53 digs).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch: Bristol Central</strong> (Stats through the Maloney match) – Brooke Valentino (sr. outside hitter, 171 kills, 28 aces, 156digs), Grace Higgins (so. right side, 52 kills, 44 aces, 93 digs), Lily Kirk (fr. middle blocker, 52 kills, 29 aces, 23 blocks, 71 digs), Olivia Clingan (sr. middle blocker, 101 kills, 28 aces, 45 blocks, 48 digs), Maddie Lodovico (sr. outside hitter, 130 kills, 53 aces, 159 digs), Alex Rivera (jr. setter, 48 aces, 130 digs, 442 assists), Sam Sklenka (sr. libero, team-leading 256 digs, 15 assists).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern’s season to date</strong> – Since the last BC/BE showdown, the Lancers have faced a tough slate of CCC programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting on October 5, Eastern lost at home to RHAM (3-1) and fell on the road in Glastonbury (3-2) but swept Middletown (3-0) on October 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Lancers faced the cream of the CCC crop – falling at Platt (3-1), versus Conard (3-1) and this past Thursday, Eastern dropped a tough 3-0 decision to powerful Southington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the term parity can be applied.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central’s season to date</strong> – The Rams have done well since that Eastern setback, going 5-2 over that stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams dropped the teams from South Windsor (3-0), Newington (3-0), Edwin O. Smith (3-1) while sweeping both Lewis Mills and Maloney along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The losses came at Simsbury (3-0) and at home this past Wednesday to Southington by a 3-1 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If parity is a word to use when describing Eastern and its opponents, the same term can be applied to Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Bristol Eastern Winning Streak – </strong>After defeating Central 3-1 in its first confrontation of the year, the Eastern volleyball program has beaten Bristol Central 56 times in a row.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Bristol Central victory over Bristol Eastern </strong>– Central’s last triumph against Eastern came back on November 3, 1994.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scooped up a thrilling 3-2 win over a tremendous five-set battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scores were 3-15, 17-15, 11-15, 15-9, and 15-11.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central improved to 12-5 overall off the win - the same record the 2022 carries now ironically - while Eastern fell to 8-10, failing to qualify for the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that season, the Lancers have been involved in the playoff round ever since – capturing state titles in back-to-back seasons of 2005-06 while a talented bunch in 2012, headlined by Brianna Root and Karissa Smith, swept East Lyme in 2012 (25-12, 25-21, and 25-20) to seize its fifth ever championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect on Monday – </strong>Bender wants to end her final season in an Eastern uniform with another sweep of Central and the Lancers have the talent to do it with Lowe, Emily and Alyssa Valentine, Reay, Lowe and Caucci in the mix.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, if Central can keep this streak out of their collective minds, playing to its potential, the home team will be in very good shape.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t count out the heart of warriors like Rivera and Sam Sklenka along with the swinging ability of Valentino, Clingan and Lodovico.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bottom Line –</strong> This is a Pick’em simply for the fact that Central is going to be playing from home.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, no matter how this match is sliced, these are two squads that are truly even in ability, size and experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is another a must-see event as the Rams look to break this dastardly losing streak against the Kingstreeters that started under the Bill Clinton administration.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are you ready for the possibility of five sets of fun on Monday evening?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be there for this huge city series battle. </p>
