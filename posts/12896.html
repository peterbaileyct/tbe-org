<h2>BCHS Baseball ready to battle Bristol Eastern in a can't miss crosstown battle on Monday</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - A very hungry Bristol Central baseball team is ready for the challenge against Bristol Eastern on Monday (6:30 p.m., Muzzy Field) in a CCC South bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams have a bit of a renewed energy back on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a bit of tomfoolery, Central is back to its winning ways after shutting out Plainville by a 6-0 final on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, the focus is getting better by the practice, by the game, and that starts with a showdown against the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For us, it’s just playing good baseball,” said Bristol Central coach Bunty Ray. “I think this team is capable.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After spinning Rocky Hill 4-2 on Friday, April 22, the Rams have struggled a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to Middletown (9-2), Maloney (7-4), and Platt (7-1) over a week’s worth of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But things changed against Plainville this past Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams earned its first shutout, a 6-0 triumph over Plainville, helping to get the program back on track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sometimes, it just takes one victory to jumpstart a season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hit a three-game slide there where we just weren’t playing well after the Rocky Hill game. Now, we have an opportunity to go out and just play better. I think if we play better with a little more passion against our opponents, I think we’re going to be in games.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At least when you’re in games, you have a chance to win.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game against Eastern could feature Frank Spirito on the mound for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Spirito is a prime-time player with plenty experience on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget about Nate Pirog who racked up two of the three Central wins this season. He could be in the mix as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lopez (second base) has been a constant as Central’s leadoff hitter while Spirito is a solid clean-up hitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Allan is a capable hitter at No. 9 while some of the other players can be slotted up and down the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Ring (catcher), the ever-improving Christian Stafford (third base), Anthony Santilli (outfield), Oscar Kuzniar (DH, pitcher), Brian Capezzone (outfield), Sean Deprey (outfielder), and Zach Vanasse (centerfield) among a host of other contributors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray just wants to get back to hitting and defense and if those elements come to the forefront, everything else should work out for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just want to play clean baseball,” said Ray. “I want to throw strikes. I want to play good defense. I cannot predict what’s going to happen offensively.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, getting JT Clark back from injury was a huge deal for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior’s on-field presence was missed because he’s a mover and a shaker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it's his glove at second base or getting on-base and stealing a couple bases - like he did against Plainville last Saturday - Clark is a big weapon in the Central line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was nice to get JT back,” said Ray of Clark. “I know that was a huge plus for us. I know he didn’t go in [against Plainville] and get great at-bats but any at-bats and just having his presence there was huge."</p>
