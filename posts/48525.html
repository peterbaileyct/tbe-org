<p>Grant applications for this cycle are submitted once a year, and are thoughtfully reviewed by twenty-eight local residents that make up the Community Foundation’s volunteer Distribution Committee. The Committee not only reviews all proposals, but also conducts site visits, and makes the final funding recommendations to the Foundation’s Board of Directors. All of this is to ensure that the goals and programs of the grantees are feasible and align with the donor’s intent.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
