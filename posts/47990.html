<p>Bristol’s Legion team hosted Danbury at Muzzy Field Tuesday night and both teams’ pitchers turned in outstanding performances. Danbury entered the night with a 9-1 record, so the locals knew they had their work cut out for them.</p>

<p>Bristol was finally able to dent the plate in the eighth inning and walk off with a 2-1 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Gavin Colvin kept his team in the game with five and two-thirds innings of four hit, one run hurling, keeping Danbury at bay while waiting for his team to scratch out some runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Colvin tired, Ryan Maglio stepped up and threw two and a third scoreless innings, yielding only one single and striking out four Danbury batters to earn the win.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connor Cyr was the only Bristol batter to get two hits, and he also was responsible for both of his team’s RBI’s, including the walk-off run in the extra inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol improved to a record of 8-6 and stays in third place in Zone 1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their next game is a 1:00 matinee against Ridgefield at Muzzy Field on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
