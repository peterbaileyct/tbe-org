<p>I’ve always said these words, and with the unnecessary death of Conn. Trooper Aaron Pelletier            of Southington on Rt. 84 just before the Bristol line recently, I was saddened and ticket-off, especially because it was due to a screwed-up driver. The death of local coach Chuck Drury earlier this year in New York, has been double pain for the Southington Blue Knight families and so many more.</p>

<p><strong>Trooper Carl P. Moller</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m reminded of a Bristol man who also made the supreme sacrifice five decades ago while helping a stranded motorist off Rt. 84 in West Hartford. He was coming off duty at the time and was struck by a passing truck whose driver asked police to check things out after he thought he may have been involved in some kind of calamity.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The officer killed was Trooper Carl Moller of Bristol, a fellow who graduated from Bristol Eastern a year ahead of me. I had his mother, Josephine, as a teacher, and knew the family well I believe Carl was divorced, and left a young daughter.</p>

<p><strong>79</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob’s birthday wishes. I turned 79 years old on Tuesday and heard from some friends, those such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David Connelly, Rick Fitzsimons, David Godbout, Joan Assinieri Forman, Kim Tabacco Kasparian, Gail Leach, Marlene Carson, John Barnett, Carol and Tim Perkins, U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Edward Edward Cercone Retired, Diane Laxas Houston, Larry Nelson, and Ron and Joanne Champagne.</p>

<p><strong>More connections</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cercone’s sister, Marilyn, graduated with Moller at Bristol Eastern; Two of their classmates also served as state troopers, Bill Greger and Hector Marrero, the latter serving down South. Pelletier and Moller were both canine handlers. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sister Gail Nicastro has died. She’s a younger sister to Frank and Mike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nelson, in his birthday wish referred to me as “Dad.” I have a couple of years on him; also, I believe he once was a member of the Plymouth Police Department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Good Guy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My condolences to the family of Karl L Nelson, II. I Heard that he was heavily involved in Little League. He reminds me of the late Russ Carter who did so much for the kids playing off Mix Street.</p>

<p><strong>UConn to Lakers?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dan Hurley, UConn men’s basketball coach, was announced on Thursday morning as the prime candidate to coach the L.A. Lakers. This was according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, a Bristol native. I believe Hurley will stay at UConn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, I’m waiting on the 2024 NBA Draft.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
