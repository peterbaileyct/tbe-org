<p>The march commemorates several dates in world history. The first is the Korean armistice agreement that was signed on July 27, 1953, ending the Korean War. The second is Aug. 15, ending Japan's rule over South Korea, which South Koreans celebrate annually National Liberation Day.</p>

<p>The event is dedicated to peace in Korea and around the world. Everyone is welcome. Participants are encouraged to coordinate ride sharing from Birge Pond back to the Federal Hill Green. Parking is available at the First Congregational Church adjacent to the Green</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
