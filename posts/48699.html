<p>The Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services department is searching for a vendor to enhance patron experience at the Rockwell Theater by providing prepared foods and beverages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This will enhance Downtown Live as we are one of the only venues in Connecticut right now that doesn’t serve prepared food or drinks," BPRYCS Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said. "Our patrons have filled out many surveys since we have opened and that has been a major request since the get go.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re looking for Easy going foods, "she continued," maybe pretzels, hummus platters, French fries, street corn in a cup; something simple to munch on that isn’t too messy for our patrons.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City of Bristol is currently accepting proposals through the Purchasing Department on behalf of the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth &amp; Community Services (BPRYCS) department to provide concession services at the Rockwell Theater located at the Bristol Arts and Innovations Magnet School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selected vendor will be responsible for providing prepared food for city-sponsored shows and events at the Rockwell Theater over the next year. Additionally, the vendor will offer a selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to theater patrons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is truly a fantastic opportunity for anyone looking to get more eyes on their business while being part of our growing premier live entertainment venue in the heart of the City of Bristol,”&nbsp;Therriault said. “A great deal of chess pieces have fallen into place to make Downtown Live what it is today. Adding a concessionaire will take this venue to the next level.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interested parties are required to submit one original copy of their proposal to the Purchasing Department. Proposal submission documents are available on the City of Bristol website and will be accepted until July 30, at 1 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
