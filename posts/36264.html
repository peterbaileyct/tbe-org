<p>Will this be the week the Bristol Central football team pops back into the win column?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It most definitely should be as the Rams are looking to break a three-game hex while Wethersfield - another member of the CCC Tier II alignment -- is currently winless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a positive situation for Central to scoop up a victory behind the versatile Jack Hartley and an offense eager to put some points up on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s time for a little home cooking for Central and here’s what to expect when the Rams and Eagles lock horns on Friday night:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wethersfield (0-6) at Bristol Central (1-5), CCC Tier II Challenge&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>6 p.m. (The turf field from BCHS)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series:&nbsp;</strong>This is the 24th all-time showdown between the Rams and the Eagles -- old friends from CCIL days gone by.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Edge:&nbsp;</strong>Currently, Wethersfield holds the lead in this series 14-9. Last year on Nov. 4, the Eagles were able to spin the Rams by a 28-7 final. The Rams were out gained in the showdown 308-164 despite a monster showing from Tre Blair. The speedster made 21 carries for 138 yards and a touchdown. That was against an Eagles’ team that won eight times in 2022.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>Central dropped a tough 42-13 decision on the road in Manchester last Friday while Wethersfield just missed against Middletown -- 18-14 -- from Cottone Field at Wethersfield High School.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect:&nbsp;</strong>Central gets the perfect opportunity to post its second win of the campaign as struggling Wethersfield comes to town…The Eagles started playing football scholastically in 1960, one season after Bristol Central (and Eastern) took the field for the first time…This year, Wethersfield is rebuilding, coming off an 8-3 campaign which included a playoff appearance…The Eagles aren’t a high scoring program as a 22-point performance at Shelton has been the squad’s season-high this year…Give Wethersfield credit for allowing Middletown just 18 points because the three games before that, opponents have averaged 43.0 points-per-game against the Eagles…The squad was blanked by Windsor 42-0 on Oct. 5 while dropped a 43-14 decision at Berlin…The Eagles allowed Middletown QB Colin Skene to connect on 8-of-13 passes for 125 yards while the Eagles defense did a credible job in slowing down the Blue Dragons as the team allowed just 2.2 yards-per-carry but scored two times on 29 rushes…Who is going to have a big game tonight for Central? It’s Jack Hartley. The outstanding junior is averaging nearly 70 rushing yards a game and is due for another breakout performance. He also has a team-leading three touchdowns and when chucking the ball, he completes 35-percent of his throws. That part of his game is still a work in progress…Against New Britain during week two, Hartley roasted the Hurricanes for 112 yards on 32 carries. Central lost 13-7, battling to the end, and showed a huge glimpse of what the former Bristol Eastern star could do…Anthony Paulino (10 carries, 129 yards, two TDs), Jayden Glasper (48-189, two TDs) and Tristian Toussaint (27-147, two TDs) have all seen success in Central’s ground games…Quincy Lewis continues to lead the squad in receiving yardage (11.2 yards-per-game) while catching one pass for a TD…Defensively, Jack Jones has been tremendous with 10.5 tackles-per-game while teammate Tyler Ryan posts 6.0 tackles and Aiden Lamarre (5.5) all help to make big stops…This game will start with a little Central defense while it will be up to the offense to cash in on those stops…It is time for the Rams to break the streak and get back to the preverbal pay window? The answer is a resounding yes.</p>
