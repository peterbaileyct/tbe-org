<p>NEWINGTON - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team wasn’t content just to show up for its first round CCC Tournament clash against top-ranked Newington on Thursday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the No. 16 ranked Lancers frustrated the Nor’easters from the initial jump ball until the final horn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington managed to come away with a 40-32 victory but had to fend off pesky Eastern (10-11) throughout the affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six lead changes highlighted a back-and-forth first half and while a slick 15-2 second period spurt by Newington (17-3) put some distance between the squads, the home team never was able to shake Eastern until the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They did a good job, especially in the first quarter and a half,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “We did a really good job defensively. We got a little tired. We really don’t have a deep bench right now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters defense held the Nor’easters to just 32-percent shooting from the field (16-of-50) while the program misfired on 19 of 22 3-point attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 40 points was the fewest Newington scored in a game during the month of February.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern limited high-scoring Bela Cucuta to just 14 points, Selah Prignano tallied only nine while Ella Stair notched all six of her points over first quarter play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought the kids did a really great job today playing against” Newington said Floyd. “They’re a good team, there’s no doubt about it. I thought we did some very good things defensively. I was very pleased about the defense, making it tough for them to shoot the ball, getting some rebounds and taking them out of their offense a little bit and making them uncomfortable out there.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern freshman Autumn Udoh posted a team-high 14 points and 13 rebounds to go along with a couple steals, Vanessa Drury scored six of her nine points over first period play, Amanda Noel chipped in four points and a couple rebounds off the bench while Taigan Parent added a hoop, three rebounds and three assists.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy nabbed two points and seven rebounds and Lauren Ayotte snared five rebounds as Eastern’s top-six players all kept the team afloat against the CCC’s top squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Vanessa did a very good job settling the team down the team today and executing,” said Floyd. “ They all did. Taigan did a good job running the offense and playing defense on [Stair]. Leah did an excellent job [defensively] on their best player.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a team, I thought they all did well out there [including] Lauren Ayotte and Autumn Udoh.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a back-and-forth first quarter as Drury splashed in three hoops over the first 3:25 of the contest - leading to Eastern’s 6-5 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams then exchanged 7-0 runs and on the Eastern front, Roy found Noel for a hoop, Drury did the same on an Udoh bucket - as did Parent - and when Drury cashed in a free throw with 4:53 to go before the half, the Lancers were in charge at 13-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Nor’easters ended the half on that 15-2 jaunt - with two Udoh free throws the only offense Eastern could muster over the run - as two big 3s by Brianna Gadarowski and Cucuta propelled the team to a 27-15 edge at the half.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we got a little tired and we lost a little focus on defense especially in the second quarter,” said Floyd. “I thought that hurt us in the middle of the second quarter. They made a little run at us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made some runs, but they kept us off from that point where could have cut that into single digits or a six-point game…to get it back within striking distance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s defense limited Newington to just seven third period points while the Nor’easters did the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury ended the stanza with a hoop and Parent found Noel for a baseline jumper as Eastern still trailed by twelve (34-22) through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers chopped the deficit down to 10 early in the fourth frame via a Parent bucket but the team could never get over the hump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A free throw by Udoh kept Eastern hanging around at 45-35 with 4:06 remaining in regulation but five straight points by Newington ended any comeback bid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers finished the game with a 7-0 burst as Roy hit a lay-up while Udoh notched the final five points as Eastern - making a very good showing - fell by eight (40-32) to end its adventure in the CCC Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is a good arena to start the tournament because now the kids know what the atmosphere is,” said Floyd. “They’re not going to be nervous when we play [on Monday, February 28].”</p>
