<p>The city’s Planning Commission will hold a public hearing tonight on the plans for extensive renovations and improvements to Page Park at 6 p.m. in the City Council chambers at City Hall. The hearing is for citizens to offer comments and ask questions about the major project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As stated in the application for site plan approval, the proposed plan includes new play areas, a splash pad, a restroom building, a great lawn, four pickleball courts, two basketball courts, new shade structures, lighting, a walk system, a multi-use trail, and extensive improvements in parking. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Page Park dam was determined to be in poor condition and requires significant repairs. The existing spillway and culvert will be replaced, a new stream channel will be created, and the pond bank will be improved. Page Park currently has about 79 parking spaces. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proposed site plan will have 226 parking spaces. This increase is due to the additional programming opportunities and the expected increased use of the park due to the proposed improvements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These changes are scheduled to occur in four stages over the next four years. The total project is budgeted to cost $13.5 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting this summer or early fall, the first of four stages of renovation will take place in the park. Stage one is pictured below. In the area where the tennis courts are presently located, the plan calls for an addition of four pickle ball courts to be built on the end (#4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pavilion is being constructed (#3) adjacent to the courts. And finally a new area of parking (#5) is situated above the courts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stage Two of the renovations is scheduled for some time in 2025. As pictured below, the Stage Two plan calls for a parking lot to be constructed at the entrance of the Page Park disc golf course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a dirt and gravel area there now that is used for parking, but that will be replaced by a paved parking lot (#14).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The centerpiece of the Page Park rebuild is planned for Stage Three. As pictured below, the area adjacent to the pond will be transformed into a hub of activity, with a playground, a splash pad, and a Great Lawn that will have multiple uses such as concerts, movies, exercise classes, parties, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be a new road constructed that will lead up to the Perry Spinelli Pavilion, and a parking area with 60 spaces will be built there with a turnaround circle right next to the pavilion.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stage Four will be the final phase of the Page Park Renovation. After a new playground is established up near the pond in Stage Three, the current playground alongside King Street will be razed and Phase Four will begin. Two new basketball courts (#2) will be built in that lower area with a parking lot (#1) where the playground used to be.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
