<p>The Bristol boy's Co-op lacrosse team went on the road to face off against #3 ranked New Canaan in the Class LL playoffs on May 29, and came home with a 16-2 loss. The Bristol squad was up against a buzz-saw as New Canaan came into the game with a single loss on the season; to #1 seed Fairfield Prep.  The New Canaan seniors have eight division one commits so the Bristol group knew they were in for a struggle before the game ever began.</p>

<p>The first quarter concluded with a 9-0 deficit for Bristol as New Canaan possessed the ball over 80% of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian Reardon found the back of the net in the 2nd quarter and Vinny Howley made eight saves in the half, but the Bristol team found themselves in an 11-1 hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Canaan called on the reserves to take the team to the 2nd round in the 2nd half.&nbsp; Brady Bell had a nice split dodge to beat two defenders to find the back of the net in the 3rd, but that would end the scoring opportunities for Bristol.&nbsp; The final score was a 16-2 defeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The tournament defeat, however, did not define Bristol’s season. The team enjoyed great team and individual success this season.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For starters, four players joined the 100-point club.&nbsp; Senior Aidan Collins finished his career with 107 points.&nbsp; This came in spite of missing half of the season with an injury.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper finished the season with 131 career points.&nbsp; That total comes on the back of 76 goals this season.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian Reardon finished with 142 points for his career, with a strong 56 goals this season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brady Bell's 161 career points was bolstered by 51 assists, which led the CCC this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Dylan Brown recorded his 300th ground ball and had 40 career goals.&nbsp; Brown's stick skills and relentless pursuit of the ball were integral to the team's success.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The strong play of the team resulted in seven players being recognized for post-season honors.&nbsp; Jayden Glasper, Brady Bell, Ian Reardon and Dylan Brown were all recognized with All-Conference 1st-team honors.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had representation in the 2nd-team as well, with Braydan Dwyer, Aidan Collins and Jack Hartley being recognized for strong play.  Those impressive performances led to Bristol finishing with a 14-5 overall record. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the seniors, Dylan Brown, Vinny Howley, Aidan Collins, and Mark Palamar, this marked the end of a great four-year run.&nbsp; Over the past four years they went 45 and 22 with two CCC playoff appearances, including one Championship.&nbsp; It was also the fourth straight CIAC playoff appearance for the Bristol Co-op.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
