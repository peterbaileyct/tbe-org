<p>After a two-win season in 2022, the Bristol Central football team has an excellent chance to rebound and hit the pay window more than a couple times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Armed with a new leader at quarterback, the Rams will be competitive in every game despite competing in the ultra-tough Central Connecticut Conference, Tier II division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Veteran coach Jeff Papazian and his crew always look forward to the challenge - leading all the way to Thanksgiving and the annual clash against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, T-Day a long way away and there’s plenty of great games in-between then and now to be played.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at the squad over at BCHS: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Bristol Central Football – 2023 &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Head Coach: </strong>Jeff Papazian   <br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Career Record:&nbsp;</strong>In his ninth season as head coach, Papazian is 48-33 overall &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 Ledger:&nbsp;</strong>The Rams were 2-8 last season (1-6 CCC Tier II) and did not qualify for the state tournament. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>:&nbsp;Returning core up front.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Replacing the all-around abilities of Tre Blair; depth. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The question</strong>: Can the Rams recover from a two-win campaign and pull off a couple upsets in CCC Tier II in 2023? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key losses:&nbsp;</strong>Julius Powell (OL/DL); Tre Blair (QB/RB/DB); Nik Salinas (QB/RB/DB); Johnny Rios (RB/DL); Mason Stokes (TE/DL); Jonmanuel Gomez (OL/DL); Andrew Sarkis (OL/DL).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch:&nbsp;</strong>Anthony Paulino (sr., WR/DB); Jack Jones (sr., OL/LB); Tashawn Cauley (jr, OL/DL); Luis Padilla (sr., OL/DL), Jack Hartley (jr. QB/DB; transfer from Bristol Eastern); Cassias Breland (sr., WR/DB); Ty Chasse-Arnold (jr., QB/DB); Jayden Colon (sr., OL/DL); Jake DeVeau (jr., WR/DB); Jayden Glasper (so., RB/DB); Aiden Lamarre (sr., WR/DB); Quincy Lawson (so., WR/DL); Ayden Pratt (sr., OL/DL); Tim Sample (jr., RB/LB); Caleb Simard (jr., TE/LB).&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to Expect from Bristol Central in 2023</strong>: One of the biggest in-town moves this summer involves a former Bristol Eastern standout that is poised to lead Central at the quarterback position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Jack Hartley, a CCC South All-Conference performer, traveled from the Lancers to the Rams’ side of town and the athlete is going to be a good one at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a sophomore, he was third for Eastern in both carries (41) and yardage (255) in 2022, averaging over five yards a carry while also cashing in on a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley attempted a couple passes last season in an Eastern uniform, but he’ll throw a lot more when he’s not smashing into opposing defenders and churning out first down yardage this time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s probably not the easiest situation for him to come into but I’ll tell you, the kid has responded in a real positive way,” said Papazian of Hartley. “He’s super-coachable and a really good, solid football player. We’re expecting a lot out of him and so far, he’s risen to the occasion.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s some experience coming back to the Rams, leaders that will help guide and shape the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seniors like wide receiver Anthony Paulino, back Cassias Breland, Ty Chasse-Arnold, defensive back Aiden Lamarre and lineman Ayden Pratt along with juniors Ty Chasse-Arnold and receiver Jake DeVeau also will factor into that experienced crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Central took its lumps with several young players getting varsity experience on the fly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some of those players had to go both ways, that experience will pay off this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomores Jayden Glasper (RB/DB) and Quincy Lawson (WR/DL) join juniors Tim Sample (RB/LB) and Caleb Simard (TE/LB) who will help this program along with their experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“We played a lot of young kids last year against some really good competition,” said Papazian. “A lot of those kids are back. It's not going to be quite enough to rely just on having that experience but in the same breath, it counts for something, too. We’re going to be a year older, but we have to be a year better, too.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If that materializes, I think we’ll be in pretty good shape.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s some good experience on the line as well, highlighted by senior Jack Jones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a bulldog on the line and the 6-footer doesn’t mind the contact or dishing it out on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Luis Padilla is going to move some opponents around, junior Tashawn Cauley is also in that mix on the lines&nbsp;along with senior Jayden Colon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colon, at guard, is going to be a quality blocker for the program as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jack Jones, Luis Padilla and Tashawn played a lot of us as a sophomore and Colon is in there at guard, too” said Papazian. “Four kids at front with some game experience is nice to have for sure.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third quarter woes doomed the Rams in 2022 because the squad showed plenty of poise throughout first half play with players sticking to the game plan and going toe-to-toe with all the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the period after the half truly doomed the program out of possible wins - leading to a tough seven-game losing streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In showdowns against Manchester, Wilton, Middletown, Wethersfield, New Britain and even Maloney, those games were competitive going into third quarter play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Central would like to close out those games with a little zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Putting together a full forty-eight minutes when the lights are at their brightest is the goal this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were in [games] often at halftime against some really good teams,” said Papazian. “That’s been really part of the charge all camp. I don’t exactly know what it was about second halves last year, but two things have been our focus. We’ve got to mentally be where we need to be whether it’s two hours on Tuesday for practice or four quarters on a Friday night.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And we’ve worked on conditioning.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will have plenty of players competing on both sides of the ball and those versatile athletes are even more experienced this time around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can keep healthy, this team has a very good chance to be a .500 team in CCC Tier II play which would be tremendous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like I depth a little more than I did last year,” said Papazian. “I know everybody in the state would like more depth but it’s not terrible from us. I’m hoping that will help. We’ve got a ton of guys that are playing two ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule:&nbsp;</strong>The second tier of the CCC isn’t a fun one and Central’s recent record over the years, leading to a playoff berth in 2021, is the reason why the program continues to hang around in Tier II despite last season’s 2-8 outcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re still on punishment for being good for a while,” joked Papazian. “I don’t know when my punishment ends.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, the Rams square off against Berlin, Enfield, Manchester, Middletown, Newington, Wethersfield and open the season against Windsor in a huge bout on Saturday (7 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following week is a date against New Britain plus a non-conference showdown against always competitive Fairfield Warde in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern won’t be any kind of picnic to end the campaign on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be a war every week but Central should be ready for anything that is thrown at the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be a challenge every week as it always is,” said Papazian. “No sense complaining about it. That’s what we have to do, that’s who we have to play. We’ll go get them.”&nbsp;</p>
