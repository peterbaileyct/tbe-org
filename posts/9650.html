<p>For the third time in program history, the Bristol Central football program is in the state tournament picture, battling Maloney on Tuesday in Class L quarterfinal play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the last time the Rams were in the playoff mix, Ronald Regan was President of the United States (I told my Papa to stop eating all those jelly beans back then…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a while but at 9-1 overall, Central has just as good a chance in winning the Class L championship as any of the other squads this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central captains Dan Lauretti, Malachi Jones, and All-State, All-Nation, and All-World candidate Victor Rosa will have the troops ready to rock and roll in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before we get to the present, we must honor the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at the Rams’ other two playoff games over the years as Central is looking for its first ever state tournament victory with a win against Maloney:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1979 - Darien vs. Bristol Central (Class A Finals)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Result: </strong>Darien 27, Bristol Central 16 - from Trumbull high school</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Highlights</strong> - A 27 yard TD dash by Billy Parks gave the Rams an 8-6 lead which carried into the second period of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central trailed just 14-8 at the half but Darien outscored the Rams 13-0 over third period to zip up a 27-8 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Donnie Anderson, Central’s QB, made half of his 16 throws for 118 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Mark DeFillippo caught a 30 yard pass for a touchdown from Anderson late in the game, making it 27-16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Parks made 12 carries for 68 yards to lead the Central rushing attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Darien went 11-1 that season while Central ended the season at a sterling 9-2, winners of its fifth straight Colonial Conference title and won a Class A Merit Award (an award was discontinued one year later) along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central averaged 29.1 points-per-game while allowing only 12.6 ppg on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1987 - Middletown vs. Bristol Central (Class MM Finals)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Result: </strong>Middletown 27, Bristol Central 0 - from Veterans Stadium, New Britain</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Highlights</strong> - It was only a 6-0 game at the half but the Blue Dragons’ defense was rolling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Dario Highsmith scored the game’s first touchdown, a one-yard jaunt towards the tail-end of the first quarter and Central never recovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Blue Dragons out-gained the Rams offensively, 364-130.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Other standouts for Central’s team that season included Mike Vita, Jaeson Cercone, Rich Parks, Mike Pirog, Carlos Martin, and Keith Rafaniello.</p>
