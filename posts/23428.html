<p>An evening of conversation, dancing and live music filled the ballroom of the New England Carousel Museum Thursday during their inaugural adult board game night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love board games; I think they’re a fun way to socialize,” said Katie Bassett. "They have a visual element that I think our audience likes; it feels like a good fit.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bassett is the education manager at the New England Carousel Museum. Since joining the staff in the fall of 2022, Bassett has organized several new museum programs, including adult board game night. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Board game enthusiasts and staff members arrived with their favorite games to share. Classic favorites like chess and checkers were seen around the room, as were newer games like Unstable Unicorns.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The swinging sounds of the Al Fenton Big Band, a 19-piece jazz ensemble based in West Hartford, wafted, bobbed and floated through the venue, including renditions of “My Favorite Things” and “Alexander’s Ragtime Band," as well as the soulful crooning of “Blue Skies” by band leader Kathy Neri. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Couples swing danced during the lively up-tempo numbers.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re so happy to have the band here,” said Morgan Urgo. “They’ll be rehearsing here on the last Thursday of every month. Anyone who comes to the events on those nights can hear them play; it’s great.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Urgo is the executive director of the New England Carousel Museum. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love the flexibility,” said Urgo. “Whether it’s dancing, playing games, listening to the band, looking at the galleries, this is really what we want, everyone enjoying the museum in their own way.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
