<p>A fundraising effort to assist with repairs to Jimmy's on the River restaurant on Terryville Road has topped the $20,000 requested with an anonymous $15,000 donation earlier today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy's on the River was target of a second car crash on early Monday morning, when a flatbed truck crashed into the front of the restaurant, nearly escaping serious injury to patrons inside but wiping out renovations that are not covered by insurance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The restaurant will be closed until further notice.</p>

<p>"Despite nearly completing 90 percent of the necessary renovations, Jimmy's On The River recently faced another devastating setback: a second crash into the restaurant. This time, customers were inside, but we are incredibly relieved that staff and patrons were able to walk away unharmed," owner Jimmy Driscoll's daughter Christina Driscoll writes on the GoFundMe page.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She adds that she has set up the fundraiser to help with the cost of repairs and to support workers while repairs are underway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Unfortunately, the businesses insurance won’t cover these damages because it was still pending inspection and estimation for the renovations," she writes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years ago, the restaurant was struck by another vehicle, which led to improvements including protective measure, she writes, such as "columns, an elevated sidewalk and a stone wall around a new patio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We believe that precautions helped prevent extensive injuries to our customers during open hours," she writes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reports in news coverage over the past week state that the flatbed truck which plowed into the building missed several customers who had just finished eating, others at the counter, and two customers dining with a 2-year-old child who saw the truck coming and were able to get out of the way.</p>

<p>The anonymous donation raised the total to $20,947. For the Jimmy's on the River Recover from Second Crash gofundme page, click <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jimmys-on-the-river-recover-from-second-crash">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
