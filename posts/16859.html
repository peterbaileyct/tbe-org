<p>The bench might be a little bit on the thin side for the Bristol Eastern girls soccer squad in 2022 but the program is excited to get the season underway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Scott Redman is going to be counting on conditioning and experience to keep the Kingstreeters in matches this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Redman can see, despite having low numbers in terms of varsity experience, that a path to state tournament is certainly within reach for the Lancers’ program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look of what to expect from Eastern this year:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN GIRLS SOCCER</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach:&nbsp;</strong>Scott ‘Redeye’ Redman</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season: </strong>Eastern went 5-8-2 overall, qualifying for the Class L Tournament. As the No. 27 seed, the Lancers fell in first round play to No. 6 Edwin O. Smith, 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strength:&nbsp;</strong>Enthusiasm</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weakness</strong>: DEPTH</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Losses</strong>: Ciara Collins (Midfield/Forward); Audra Porowski (Defense); Grace D’Amato (Keeper); Maura Cyr (Defense).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern 2022 Girls Soccer Line-up:&nbsp;</strong>Abigale Pelletier (jr.), Keeper; Cecelia Gilbert (sr.), Defense; Emma Stavens (jr.), Midfield; Leah Roy (so.), Midfield; Taigan Parent (sr.), Defense; Megan Krok (so.), Midfield; Maria Perrone (so.), Forward; Julia Armington (sr.), Defense; Emily Piendak (sr.), Defense/Forward; Maggie Kozikowski (so.), Defense/Forward; Kate Patterson (fr.), Midfield/Forward; Shannon Philippon (fr.), Defense/Midfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect from the program:&nbsp;</strong>The Lancers have some pieces in place this season, but a strong senior crew graduated, others did not return to the team, and it will be up to several first-year varsity contributors to get up to speed quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a lot to replace with many key contributors from last year moving on,” said Redman.” However, we have a nice core of young and hungry players ready to step in and compete.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Cecelia Gilbert certainly has the defensive credentials and is one of those experienced hands Redman will be turning to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s a two-time CCC South All-Conference pick and is one of the leaders of the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joining Gilbert on the back line will be seniors Taigan Parent , Julia Armington and Emily Piendak along with sophomore Maggie Kozikowski and freshmen Shannon Philippon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent is one of those jack-of-all-trade athletes and don’t be surprised if she flips in a goal or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Abigale Pelletier takes over for Grace D’Amato in the net and is eager for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She got to learn from a good one in D’Amato and Pelletier should be another solid player leading the charge on the back line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JuniorEmma Stavens is an experienced midfielder that could be one of the squad’s leading scorers while sophomores Leah Roy and Megan Krok help make up the rotation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Maria Perrone will be up at forward while Piendak and Kozikowski could also see minutes up front as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If this squad can work, scratch and claw for forty minutes every match – and not pass out in the process – the Lancers will be able to snare its share of victories this season and make another postseason appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if opponents want to quicken the pace, it won’t help the Kingstreeters in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CCC South outlook</strong>: Eastern won’t be able to duck anyone as the squad opens the 2022 docket against Lewis Mills and Berlin – a tough start to the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers travel to Mills today at 3:45 p.m. while opening the home portion of the season next Tuesday against the Redcoats from Alumni field in Bristol (6 p.m.), under the lights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the road doesn’t get any easier from there in terms of CCC play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are going to have to manufacture victories against the likes of Maloney (September 27) and Plainville (October 21) in order to qualify for the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But every match is going to be a challenge including two showdowns against crosstown rival Bristol Central – the first coming on Thursday, October 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the path to playoff qualification is there but Eastern is going to have to pull out wins and critical ties to get there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With a loaded conference and challenging schedule, we will need to be up for the challenge day in and day out,” said Redman. </p>
