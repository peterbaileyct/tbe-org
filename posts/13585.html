<p>BRISTOL - After the holiday weekend, both the baseball squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern will start Class L state tournament play on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s kind of amazing how the squads finished in the overall standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs ended the year at 9-11 with the Rams just finishing with two more power points than the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two points made a huge difference in determining which team earned the higher seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, six Class L programs ended the campaign at 9-11 but Central (78) had the most points between Berlin (73), North Haven (63), Stratford (44), Cheney Tech (38), and Eastern (76).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant the Rams seized the No. 22 seed and Eastern followed at twenty-three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at the two matchups for the Bristol programs in first round play:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No. 22 Bristol Central at No. 11 Woodstock Academy</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central might have drawn a favorable first round opponent in the form of No. 11 Woodstock Academy on Tuesday, May 31 at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, in first round action, Woodstock was two-hit against Eastern but managed to cobble together a 3-1 win before getting booted in the following round by No. 20 Wilton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, after a 12-4 start, the Centaurs finished the regular season with four straight losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central goes to junior pitching stud Frank Spirito on the hill for that contest, Woodstock is in for a long road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of the BC/Woodstock affair plays the victor of No. 6 Wethersfield and No. 27 Cheney Tech on June 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of note, the Eagles have lost three straight which included a 6-3 setback to Bristol Eastern to end the regular season at 15-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, over the first two rounds, anything is possible for the Bristol Central baseball program and head coach Bunty Ray knows that fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No. 22 Bristol Eastern at No. 10 Maloney</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh boy, Maloney drew a first-round match-up it probably would like changed immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers travel to Meriden on Tuesday (3:30 p.m.) in what has turned into a first round CCC South state tournament battle. The game is currently scheduled to commence from Maloney High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has already beaten this Maloney program this season. And history isn’t on the side of the Spartans in terms of past appearances against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans (12-8) had a good season but didn’t have a great game against the Eastern back on April 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a chilly day from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol, Maloney was overwhelmed by Eastern’s senior captain Jaydon Churchill as the Spartans fell 5-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitcher was brilliant against Maloney, going six innings, allowing just six hits while striking out 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win over Maloney that day saw Eastern rack up its 70<sup>th</sup> all-time victory against the Spartans. Overall, the Lancers hold a 70-52 edge in all-time head-to-head showdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could Eastern head coach Steve Gaudet turn to Churchill in that first round showdown?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitching stud Michael Roalf would make sense as well. The junior has thrown the ball well this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Maloney is in a bit of a no-win situation as Eastern is a team no one really wants to face in first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of Eastern’s first round challenge plays the victor of No. 7 Wilcox Tech (15-5) and No. 26 Stratford on June 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a remote possibility that if Eastern beats Maloney and due to the fact technical school programs always seem to struggle during postseason play, the Kingstreeters could have a home tournament game over the ensuing round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one game at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be surprised if Eastern advances to second round play after a hard-fought victory over a tremendous Maloney program.&nbsp;</p>
