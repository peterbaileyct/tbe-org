<p>The Bristol Central softball squad has been on fire as of late after a tough loss to open the 2022 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams opened the season with a 3-2 loss at Plainville on Monday, April 11 but since that time, Central has put together five straight wins - outscoring opponents 44-8 as the local’s pitching and defense has been extremely strong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that one-run loss to the Blue Devils, Central shutout Platt (8-0) on April 14, dropped Berlin over a sterling 2-0 effort on April 16 and the two days later against Enfield, the Rams roped up a sterling 12-0 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s contest against Enfield just went six innings as Central pitching limited the Eagles to just four hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia Torreso was tremendous in the circle and offensively, the Rams smoked out eight hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Sklenka led the charge with three hits, including a double while teammate Lorelei Stancavage smacked out a triple and scored three times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enfield fell to 4-2 on the season off the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then this past Thursday, non-conference challenger Pomperaug came to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the venue was changed in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to unplayable conditions at the high school, the game was shifted to Casey Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the location was hardly the story as Central spun Pomperaug, 16-6, as the locals moved to 4-1 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Twitter, Bristol Central coach Monica Hayes awarded the '<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dirtballer?src=hashtag_click">#dirtballer</a> of the day’ award to Gabby Buonafede.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In her first varsity start, Gabby came up big offensively when the game was in limbo and closed out the game with two huge defensive plays,” said Hayes on Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s offense has been on-point as the squad averages just under 8.0 runs-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Newington no match for the Rams</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central picked up a huge victory on Friday against a very good Newington program by a 6-2 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Torreso was on fire from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker wrangled up 14 strikeouts as Central won for the fifth time on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>State tournament qualification on the line to end April</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a realistic chance of qualifying for state tournament play this coming week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Ram cans run the table against Maloney on Monday in Bristol (3:45 p.m.), Wednesday at Platt (3:45 p.m.), and in a home bout against Hall on Thursday (5:30 p.m.), Central will have win No. 8 in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Big things are on the horizon for the Bristol Central softball program, even before the program’s first city series game takes place.</p>
