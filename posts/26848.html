<p>BRISTOL – After a tremendous 12-0 start to the baseball campaign, the program at Bristol Central hit a bit of a roadblock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in life, it's&nbsp;about how you finish in the end because after that twelve pack of games for the Rams, it was gloom, doom and misery&nbsp;over the next six contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In between victories against rival Bristol Eastern, Central posted a&nbsp;0-6 ledger with losses coming in the form of mercy ruled setbacks and near&nbsp;misses due to injury and misfortune.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this group rallied around its senior core of Dom Guzzardi, Brian&nbsp;Arias, Nick Krompegal, Seth Bissonnette, Jack Bellantuono along with&nbsp;captains Christian Stafford, Mike Allen, Ryan Ring and the injured Frank Spirito IV.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the squad pulled out two improbable wins after that losing streak, snaring victories over&nbsp;Bristol Eastern (7-1) on May 22 and then downing Avon (7-2) two days&nbsp;later to complete the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm proud of all my seniors," said Ray. "I'm proud of all of them [for]&nbsp;what they do [and] how hard they work."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those players left it all on the line this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't forget what Ring, Central’s slick catcher, did in that contest against Eastern back on May 22.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During sixth inning play, Eastern's Caleb Molinsky popped up a ball behind the plate and Ring was off and running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He sprinted after the ball, making a spectacular catch as he smashed&nbsp;his body against the backstop for a huge putout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big out, showing the passion of what one of Central's&nbsp;best&nbsp;student athletes – inside and outside of the classroom – gives on a&nbsp;daily basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"That's a senior who runs through a wall for you, literarily, and you&nbsp;know what? That's who he is," said Ray of Ring.&nbsp;"That's why he's back there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Losing Spirito was a big loss, and it took some time for the Rams to&nbsp;rally, but with two wins under their belt and some momentum going into the&nbsp;Class L playoffs, it was time for this senior crew to flip the&nbsp;script.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This group had it rough," said Ray. "We had COVID, we had quarantines&nbsp;and they were getting to [finally] play baseball,” said Ray. “I can't say enough&nbsp;about my senior group."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two in a row</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that 7-1 win against Eastern, Central battled Avon, another squad&nbsp;with an identical 13-6 ledger, in a big time CCC Interdivisional showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took an extra day due to rain but the Rams pushed out a 7-2 victory&nbsp;to finish the season at 14-6 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lopez earned the win as Central smoked out five runs in the first&nbsp;inning and another in the second to nab a 6-2 lead, never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a critical victory for the program, getting that all important&nbsp;14th win to finish in the top eight of the Class L field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray <em>might</em> like the draw because Central, ranked eighth in the Class L bracket, opens up against No. 25 Daniel Hand (9-11) in a showdown starting at 3:15 p.m. from Muzzy Field this afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day, Central – if the squad advances – squares off against&nbsp;the winner of No. 9 Notre Dame West Haven and No. 24 Cheney Tech.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A possible quarterfinal date against No. 1 Wilcox Tech (18-2) with other opponents such as No. 32 Wilton (7-12) and No. 16 Lyman Hall and No. 17&nbsp;ranked Windsor – both at 12-8 overall – looms in the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Wilcox Tech, the top teams in the Class L bracket are No. 2 East&nbsp;Lyme, No. 3 Guilford and No. 4 Woodstock Academy, all coming in at 17-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brookfield (fifth overall, 15-5 record) follows allow with No. 6 Middletown and No. 7&nbsp;Rockville at 14-6 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Bristol Central’s coaching staff, under long time coach Bunty Ray, includes Mitch Rossi, Juan Quintero, Matt Pirog and Kelly McCabe.</p>
