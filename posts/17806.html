<p>On Friday night, things were not looking very good for the Bristol Eastern volleyball team, as they dropped two consecutive sets to Newington and were facing their second defeat of the year. But as the Lancers have done so often in the past, they settled down and raised their level of play, ultimately winning the final three sets and pulling out a well-deserved victory at the Newington gymnasium.</p>
