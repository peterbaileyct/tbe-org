<p>Angry taxpayers and local heroes were at the forefront of July's city council meeting Tuesday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Summer is our busiest season with 100’s of programs and our summer camp series,” said Dr. Joshua Medeiros, superintendent of Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services (BPRYCS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medeiros had the opportunity to introduce summer camp staff member Jalen Benoit who had recently become a local hero when he came to an aide of a co-worker who was choking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BPRYCS summer camp nurse Mary Tomasi was eating lunch with her colleagues when she began to choke and wheeze on her food.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was trying to be healthy and eat quinoa, never again,” joked Tomasi, who attended the council meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomasi took the podium and recounted motioning to Benoit that she was indeed choking and in need of assistance. He was able to administer abdominal thrusts which ultimately stopped her choking and saved her life. She ended her recollection by giving Benoit a huge public thank you for saving her life.</p>

<p>Benoit took the podium afterwards to much applause and he jokingly thanked his “fanclub.” Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano then presented him with an All-Heart Award. Benoit posed with his award with his family and staff members for a photo op to close off the opening ceremony for this month's meeting.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public participation for the month had a very common theme as all three speakers were motivated by one specific topic. Recently, the mill rate had been lowered for Bristol citizens but many people's taxes largely increased even with this lower rate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first citizen to come to the podium was Stacie Roberge, who said the average home property taxes were raised by about 22 percent this year. Rather than choosing an optional phase-in to the tax increase, which other Connecticut towns and cities had elected, Roberge said, Bristol chose to tax the entire amount.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next to speak during the public participation portion of the meetings was Mel Bee, who called for the city council and mayor to be more respectful of taxpayers. Bee's comments consisted of listing mill rates throughout the years including 75.70 in 1976 and 26.5 in the 1990’s a result of ESPN’s massive success at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bee's point was that this year's mill rate reduction is essentially just a number to hide the real increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final person to comment was Joan Pelkey. Pelkey said this year's tax increase affects people who have a fixed income and how it made her have to apply for her senior volunteer tax credit for the first-time ever. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano did interject to let her know that she can also apply for a $500 senior homeowner credit right now.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
