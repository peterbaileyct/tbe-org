<p>BRISTOL - When Bristol Central pitching sensation Aiden Lopez took the mound on Wednesday afternoon, the squad from Platt High School was in for a long ride.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Panthers’ bats were mainly silent over the first six innings of the game, Central’s offense went on the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams notched eight runs before Platt’s offense could even muster a hit as Central secured a big 10-3 victory from McCooey Field on the campus of BCHS in CCC interdivisional action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are now a perfect 6-0 after spinning Lewis Mills (6-1) the previous day while Platt fell to 2-5 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Platt, Lopez showed plenty of grit, determination, and ability from the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just two hits and two unearned runs while walking three and striking out a dozen batters for another big win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He had a no-hitter going into the sixth inning,” said Central coach Bunty Ray of Lopez. “He did a tremendous job. I was just so happy the way came back from his last start. He was very consistent. He had a lot of walks last time but his breaking ball was working, his stuff was electric [and] he did a great job.” <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Joe Gratta opened the fun with a towering shot to right field in the bottom of the first inning that simply kept carrying – sliding into third base via a triple.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was one of three hits Gratta dropped into right field that afternoon (double, two triples).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he came home on a one-hop single to left by Oscar Kuzniar, making it 1-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank Spirito IV then hustled out an infield hit to second and when Lopez skipped a ball to shortstop, the play went to third base.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hustling Kuzniar ended up safe off a poor throwover to third, loading things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey McMahon ended up walking in a run as Kuzniar tagged the dish and when Spirito scored on a wild pitch, the Rams led 3-0 through one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez shut the Platt lineup down in order in the second stanza as Gratta ended the frame with a diving catch in centerfield – robbing Platt’s Hunter Sincovic of a possible double to the gap.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the bottom of the second, Gratta was at it again, dropping a long fly ball to right and the speedster legged out another three-base hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you have a leadoff hitter than can get you to third base just to start the game, that’s a weapon,” said Ray of Gratta. “He did it a couple times. I was happy for him.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with one away, Kuzniar sent a screamer down the left field line as the RBI tally made it a 4-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two batters later, Ryan Ring smashed a double by the third basemen to put runners on second and third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzniar came home on a balk while Lopez helped his own cause with a single to left, plating Ring, as the Rams snared a 6-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez generated two straight strikeouts to open the third tilt but a walk and an error put two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing came of it as Lopez and the defense kept the shutout intact.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams added another run to the till in the third, starting out with a one-out single by Mike Allan and then Gratta was back at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He slammed another ball to right which strangely bounced just in front of the fielder as the junior hustled out a double.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Anthony Santilli grounded out to second, Allan easily scored from third as Central snatched up a 7-0 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re just numbers in the line-up. I have confidence in every single batter that goes to the plate,” said Ray of his batting order. “These guys can hit. They produce runs. Our base running was a little bit better today. I still think we can work harder to be honest with you.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not pleased with the way we finished the game but we can work on that. It’s early.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez was cruising in the fourth, fanning the Platt side for strikeouts six, seven and eight as he was putting together a possible no-hit bid.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito snuck a ball by shortstop to open the fourth as brother Rocco came in to pinch run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He advanced to second on a balk and nabbed third base when the Platt infield was sleeping.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Lopez lofted a fly ball to center for an out, allowing Rocco Spirito to score from third, as the sacrifice made it an 8-0 contest through four.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not much changed for the Panthers in the top of the fifth as Lopez scooped up two more strikeouts – 10 overall and five in a row – while Allan made a slick throw from shortstop that was scooped in by Kuzniar at first base to end the inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez cruised into the top of the sixth but with one away, the next three batters reached base off an error, a single by Jayden Gaither and a walk to load things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt eventually plated two runs but the visiting team trailed 8-2 going into the bottom of the sixth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocco Spirito slapped a base hit to right with one gone in the sixth and then on a hit and run, Lopez slammed a double to center to plate the lead runner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After one final hit and RBI, Central’s edge reached 10-2 with a half-inning to play and Nick Krompegal taking the hill for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He struck out the first batter, back-up first baseman Seth Bissonnette did a sick split (a.k.a. Jean-Claude Van Damme style. Look him up, kids) in catching a ball thrown from shortstop before an error and an RBI double by Gaither made it a 10-3 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, one more slick putout at first base by Bissonnette sealed the deal as the Rams moved to 6-0 over the seven run triumph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is on a roll to open 2023 and Ray believes his team can achieve even more once all the pieces are in sync.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s just a mindset for them. They have to have a little more mental toughness to close out games,” said Ray. “That game [against Platt] should have been clean at the end. We should have been out of there [sooner]. We made some errors. All Platt’s runs were unearned. Luckily, the offense was there to bail us out but that’s not always going to be there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got to play better defense.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Ray’s teams at Central are now 19-8 all-time against Platt…Next week, the Rams hit the road for three games.
