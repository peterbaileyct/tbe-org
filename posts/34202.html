<p>The Democratic Town Committee opened its headquarters at the site of the former Rite Aid pharmacy at Northside Square Saturday evening with pizza for anyone who turned up and a surprise visit from Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, who posed for pictures.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We had an amazing evening," said Scott Rosado, who is challenging incumbent Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano. "The DTC was filled with excitement, new faces and long-time supporters."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About 100 people turned up for the opening that included volunteer sign ups, distribution of yard signs and chats with the candidates.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It shows the enthusiasm the Bristol community has for the upcoming election," said Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller, a council candidate in District 1. "It was encouraging to see all the new faces who came in support of our slate."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said about his running mate in District 1, Kim Caron, that they work well together and he believes they would both be assets to the council and Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron said she enjoyed the evening, too, as well as working with Rasmussen-Tuller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I enjoyed meeting and talking with many voters in my district along with others, and listening to their concerns and issues," said Caron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She added, "Andrew cares deeply for Bristol and its residents, and I know he can be counted to help however he can."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DTC chair Ken Rasmussen-Tuller said he was extremely happy with the turnout, as well as this year's slate of candidates who work well together and support each other.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
