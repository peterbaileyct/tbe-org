<p>The reveal of the mural honoring the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. drew over a hundred people to the New England Carousel Museum, directly across from Primo Press, last evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the speakers was Joseph Hudson Jr., the brother of the late Barbara Hudson, who resided in Bristol and was a nationally recognized art lecturer. Hudson graduated from Bristol Eastern High School in 1960 before obtaining a master’s degree from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. </p>

<p>Hudson was the executive director of the Amistad Foundation of the Wadsworth Atheneum and was nationally recognized as a curator of African American Art. Among her projects was a proposal for recognizing a Black historical district in Bristol.</p>

<p>Also addressing the crowd were Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano and former council member Scott Rosado of Primo Press, upon whose building the mural appears.</p>

<p>The MLK Mural is titled “Infinite Hope” in an homage to the famous Martin Luther King, Jr. quote “We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will also be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
