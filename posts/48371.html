<p>This private construction project is being conducted by Berkshire and Eastern Railroad, the company that owns the freight rail line, according to the State Department of Transportation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The existing railroad crossing, located on Route 6 near the intersection of Route 69 (Burlington Avenue) is being completely replaced with all-new materials to enhance safety, provide a smooth passage for motorists, as well as ensuring the long-term viability of freight rail service in the region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the repairs, cyclists and pedestrians will still be able to cross through a designated area and will not be detoured. All businesses on Route 6 will remain accessible throughout the short-term construction project.</p>

<p>Detour signs have been posted along routes 69, 72 and 229 to bypass the construction sites. Motorists are encouraged to avoid the area. Posted detour routes will allow motorists to avoid local streets and low underpasses.</p>

<p>These projects are funded through a CTDOT Rail Freight Improvement Program (RFIP) grant. Work is being performed in coordination between the CTDOT, City of Bristol, first responders, bus and transit providers and Berkshire and Eastern Railroad.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
