<p>Let's hope Tuesday has something to offer. Monday, in a word, was really freaking boring as all get out. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect, but don’t count on, mostly sunny with a high of 44.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On this date, 1960 in Bristol</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two city officials were subpoenaed to testify in a civil case against Bristol Shopping Plaza Inc. A 30-foot buffer zone in the rear of the Plaza property was created to afford protection to residents of Vance Road. It was charged that the terms of said agreement were violated.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sounds like a John Lennon solo record with the Beatles playing on it. Regardless, the GMB is grateful to hear them together once more.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why isn’t there a reality show where flat earthers are forced to find the edge of the world?</p>

<p>We need singles, so we will be right back, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
