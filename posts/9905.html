<p>WINDSOR - The Bristol Eastern girls basketball easily could have thrown in the towel during its Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional showdown at Windsor on Friday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed big early, made a tremendous comeback late - eventually forcing overtime against the Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the extra session, Windsor outscored Eastern by an 11-5 push to snare a 63-57 victory for its first win of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters fell to 0-2 overall but showed grit over its first two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ciara Collins scored a team and career-high 32 points in the losing cause but helped her squad late to force the overtime period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins notched over 56-percent of her team’s offensive total which was an amazing showing against a very tough Windsor squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent added nine points - retying her season and career-high - while Emma Stavens netted seven, matching her total against Edwin O. Smith to open the season, to lead the Eastern cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayanne Franks scored 34 points to lead all scorers, notching nine of Windsor’s eleven points in overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed 15-6 after the first quarter of play while the Warriors zipped out an eighteen-point lead midway through the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers went on a late run in the period and did a tremendous job in making it a single-digit affair again, trimming the deficit to 27-18 at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins then dropped in 10 third period points while Parent hit two big hoops as Eastern pulled to within three at 37-34 by the completion of three quarters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And eventually, Parent helped Eastern capture the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers eventually captured the lead with ninety seconds remaining in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent scored a hoop to give Eastern a two-point lead at 50-48. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor retook the edge before Stavens canned an outside jumper to put Eastern up again at 52-50 with less than a minute to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But two foul shots by the Warriors tied the contest up at 52-52 as Eastern had one more chance to win the game before overtime was needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Collins took a final shot at it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her reverse layup off an inbounds play with six seconds left did not fall as four more minutes were added to the clock in order to decide the ultimate victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams traded hoops to open the fifth frame, but Franks went to the line on consecutive plays, making four foul shots, propelling the Warriors to a 58-54 edge it would not relinquish the rest of the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers look to get to the pay window for the first time this year on Tuesday, squaring off against Hall in a CCC Interdivisional tilt from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall opened its campaign last Tuesday with a 63-50 loss to Middletown in West Hartford.</p>
