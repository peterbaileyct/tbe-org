<p>BRISTOL<strong> - </strong>In city series battles this season, the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse squad nearly picked off Bristol Central earlier in the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just this past Friday, the Lancers were in the mix against St. Paul Catholic as well, dropping a tough 12-11 decision in non-conference play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons improved to 5-7 overall, winning its last two matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 7-6 overall but kept it close throughout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciara Collins led the Eastern charge with four goals, Emma Stavens and Vanessa Drury added three scores apiece while Makenzie Aparo also scored for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Avery Ellis was tough in the goal while Audra Porowski and Jayna Hatcher battled on the defensive end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Stavens is a scoring machine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens, with a free position goal midway through the St. Paul Catholic match, helped Eastern get within one at 8-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tally by Stavens gave her a new single season scoring record at Eastern with 51 goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She added another score late in the contest and now has 52 goals for the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins was the old record holder with 50, established last season by the then junior standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The rest of the way</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern finishes the regular season with three matches this week, followed by the state tournament fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, the Lancers travel to Wethersfield for a CCC Interdivisional showdown (6 p.m.) and then on Thursday, it’s a trip to Cromwell for non-conference action (3 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the week, its Central/Eastern, Part 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams travel to Alumni Field for a 6:30 p.m., under the lights extravaganza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will be looking to avenge it’s 10-8 setback to Central back on April 25.</p>
