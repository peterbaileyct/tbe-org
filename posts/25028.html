<p>Bristol Eastern softball head coach Tyler Catlin almost had to produce dinner for his squad after one heck of a battle against Berlin on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catlin had promised his team a free meal if they could have toppled the Redcoats in a CCC South showdown from Sage Park in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Kingstreeters fell just a little short, dropping a 3-2 decision to fall to 1-2 in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had several standout performers all over the diamond to keep pace with Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Beebe earned the start in the circle for the Lancers, going the distance and allowing just a solitary earned run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her battery mate, Sarah Lacouture, led the offensive charge with two hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Standouts Emily Valentine and Gracie Browne chipped in with RBI singles as Eastern put Berlin on the brink but just couldn’t get over the hump in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was slated to square off against Avon last Friday, but the contest was postponed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this week, the Lancers are in action three times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, Eastern travels to Meriden to square off against Maloney from the Dunn Sports Complex at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Wednesday, Eastern returns home for a showdown against the always competitive South Windsor squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The start time for the contest is slated for 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally on Saturday, it’s a rare city series bout against St. Paul Catholic over a special non-conference challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest takes place from the softball field on the campus at St. Paul Catholic (11 a.m.).&nbsp;</p>
