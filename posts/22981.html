<p>BRISTOL – The stakes are indeed high in Monday’s final city series bout of the year between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern girls basketball programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victor of this game will improve its playoff positioning and both squads could use the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visiting Eastern is 10-9 and currently slated for a Class L road contest for first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has put together one of its best seasons ever, posting a 14-5 ledger - currently looking at the eighth position in the Class L standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A win by the Rams gets the program a sweep over the Lancers while the Kingstreeters are looking to finish above .500 to end regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be a fun one from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS and here’s what to expect as the regular season comes to a close for both programs:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern at Bristol Central, CCC South showdown</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium – from the campus of BCHS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When</strong>: Monday, 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The storylines to consider</strong>: Eastern hasn’t been swept by the Rams since the early 2000s. It’s a situation the Kingstreeters prefer to avoid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central finishing at 15-5 would be one of the top regular season ledgers in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, a lot is riding on the line for both teams in a must-win situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (10-9 overall) – Head Coach:&nbsp;</strong>Tony Floyd</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Jayle Evins Mosely (freshman), Forward/Center</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Tavia Swain (sophomore), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (14-5 overall) – Head Coach:&nbsp;</strong>Steve Gaudet</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Probable Line-up:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Brooke Watson (junior), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Arianna Rivera (junior), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Leilani Jackson-Mills (sophomore), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Nicole Riemer (freshman), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Molly McMahon (freshman), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Julia Pikiell (freshman), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will Eastern even-up the series</strong>? The Lancers are on a bit of a hot streak, winning three in a row and four of its past five games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That confidence has gone a long way and now, Central is the final regular season obstacle Eastern has to face before the postseason commences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been getting better every week,” said Floyd. “We’re really starting to come around as a team and we’re doing a lot of good things. The younger kids are starting to understand what we want from them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since losing three-of-four, which included Floyd’s 600th career win over Eastern’s 41-12 stomping of Career Magnet back on January 21, the Kingstreeters have defeated Maloney (55-22), dropped a tough 46-28 decision to Conard, but came back to hang losses on Farmington (57-41), Middletown (71-34) and Plainville (44-17) this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over its last four victories, Eastern has allowed just 28.5 points-per-game and that’s the goal at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all about defense from the jump ball until the final horn is blown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re doing a better job defensively,” said Floyd. “We’re doing a better job on the boards. We’re executing our half-court game much better and that’s the biggest thing. We’ve cut down on our turnovers and what I think helps us is the schedule that we’ve been playing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve won some tough games.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior shooting stud Taigan Parent has been on fire as of late, dropping over 50 three-pointers to date, to go along with her 15.0 points-per-game average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’ll do her fair share of rebounding, can and will dish the ball off and averages right around two steals an outing. Parent can and will play defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman center/forward Autumn Udoh has been simply sensational in her first year at Eastern - averaging a healthy double-double of 11 points and 11 rebounds while rejecting just over four shots a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’ll match that total in steals and usually plays the entire game for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point guard Vanessa Drury chips in eight points, four rebounds and four assists-per-game while picking off several players every outing (3.1 steals-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy and Lauren Ayotte are excellent support staff while Amanda Noel is the sixth man for the Lancers this year, displaying an ever-improving jumper while nabbing her share of rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That six-man unit, along with Tavia Swain and Jayle Evins Mosely have also contributed when healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Banner season for the Rams and maybe a sweep…&nbsp;</strong>It’s been quite a season for Central, improving its record from last year by three games and counting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central has been winning early and often against a variety of opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had won five straight games before the 41-28 setback to Berlin last Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But both the Rams and Lancers lost to Berlin by similar margins and this rematch between the Bristol programs will once again be nearly even-steven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the big advantage of playing from home - at the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium - and will enjoy senior night festivities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those festivities will be quick as there’s only one senior on the team this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kanye Laird, a nifty defensive guard who has been a thorn in the side of the Lancers for quite some time, will be honored before the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, she averages around 3.0 ppg but her strength is on the defensive end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird will defend Parent early and often, at least until she runs into foul trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Callie Lodovico (6.0 ppg) may draw that defensive assignment as well as multiple bodies might be in the mix to guard Parent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leilana Jackson-Mills (11.0 ppg) can make shots from outside-in, Ariana Rivera (10.0 ppg) will steal the ball at a moment’s notice and has an ever-improving offensive game, and freshman Nicole Riemer (9.0 ppg) is going to be a star in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molly McMahon and Julia Pikiell also hurt the Lancers the last time around and it could happen again at BCHS with some long-range shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet always has a defensive plan in mind for the BC/BE game and expect a slowdown affair, a possession-by-possession battle that - once again - will probably come down to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be a fun city series bout on Monday night between to 10-plus win programs.</p>
