<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Police responded to a call around 9 a.m. involving James Ferro Jr., who had been waving a gun out of the window of his home at 49 Woodland St., according to a police department release. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The caller told officers that she owns a multi-family residence neighboring Ferro's home and that each time her tenants pass Ferro's residence they are harassed by him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said, according to the report, she had been filming the residence to capture the number of surveillance cameras on the property, when Ferro yelled at her, displayed a firearm and caused "her to fear for her safety." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police officers surrounded Ferro's home, making contact with him and then taking him into custody. After a search warrant was obtained, police found in his home multiple firearms, a pistol permit and associated ammunition, which were seized, according to the police, "to prevent him from being a harm to the public."</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
