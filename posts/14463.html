<p>"The CIAC fully supports the importance of our athletic trainers," said CIAC Assistant Director Joe Velardi. "We worked collaboratively with our athletic trainers to help schools with their emergency action plans and heat illness policies. In addition, we worked together to deliver 85 cold water immersion tubs to our schools. The safety and well being of our athletes is our top priority."</p>
