<p>CROMWELL - Where would the Bristol Central volleyball program be without the immense contributions of freshman Lily Kirk? &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tremendous athlete must have ice water in her veins because on Wednesday night against East Lyme, the first-year warrior scooped up a career high 11 kills - dropping down the hammer over the game-winning point of the Rams’ 3-1 victory against the Vikings as Central was championship bound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Honestly, I was kind of numb the whole time,” said Kirk who was cool as a cucumber before, during and after the semifinal showdown against East Lyme. “I wanted to do it for my team. It wasn’t for me. I wanted to do it for my team, so it motivated me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former gymnast is a blur in motion on the court and when the pressure is seemingly at its highest, this first-year player isn’t phased in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she does a little of everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 103 kills, 40 blocks, 38 aces and 59 digs tell the story of a skilled player and an invaluable contributor to Central’s successful volleyball program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her athleticism helps to create some major mismatches up front and then the power she displays, crushing the ball over the net, is a pleasure to witness.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think genetics help," said Central coach Lance Pepper with a grin, referring to Lily's mother Tamara Stafford-Kirk. "Being a gymnast, she's used to working by herself and if she doesn't perform, it's on her. [But] she played out of her of her mind tonight. She’s not [playing like a] freshman.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford-Kirk was one of the top hurdlers ever in Bristol Eastern track and field history and Uncle Jason - a three sports star for the Lancers - holds numerous records from his play as one of the keepers on the boys soccer team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Kirk is just getting started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The incredible thing about the freshman is her statistics in volleyball fall under the radar and those kinds of athletes can be the most dangerous players on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you start doing your homework on Central, the obvious players swinging the ball with zest include Brooke Valentino, Maddie Lodovico and Olivia Clingan - a powerful senior trio that averages nearly eight combined kills per set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s Kirk who suddenly pops into the rotation, blocking shots from the front, tallying numerous kills via fast kills, bumping up a ball or two while leaving opponents a bit dazed and confused along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since the start of the postseason, Kirk has elevated her level of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against East Lyme, Kirk dropped in nearly a dozen kills while rejecting a couple shots along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s the serving component.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of those balls she sent speeding over the net are beginning to give opponents serve-receive issues which is problematic in the return game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"She caused a lot of issues tonight," said Pepper of Kirk. "Her hang time is unreal and to have that composure in a state semifinal game is something we haven't seen in a while, especially out of any Bristol kid."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watching her tally the game-winning point against East Lyme would get anyone hyped as she slammed the ball down, let out a primal scream - knowing that her squad was heading to the finals - as her teammates mobbed her on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels amazing,” said Kirk. “I’ve never felt this way before. I can’t even describe it. It’s so euphoric. It’s crazy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there has also been the tremendous play from Grace Higgins, another athlete that has come up huge for the Rams this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Higgins, another solid hitter you can’t sleep on, is nearing 100 kills on the campaign - good for fifth place on the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore dropped in 10 kills against second ranked Suffield last Saturday and then against East Lyme, her seven kills gave the Rams a huge lift.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the underclassmen mesh in well with a strong and experienced senior group, that starting core becomes an even more formidable one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are literally insane,” said Central’s Sam Sklenka of the contributions from Higgins and Kirk. “They amaze me every day and I’m so proud of them. The growth they’ve all made throughout the entire season is literally crazy. And we wouldn’t be here without them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are a huge part of this team and we’re so thankful for the both of them.”</p>
