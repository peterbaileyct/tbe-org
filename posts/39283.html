<p>BRISTOL - It’s that time of the year…already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday marks another all-too-early city series boys basketball bout as the squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern clash at the annual BC Holiday Classic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers came away with the tournament championship last season, defeating Simsbury 63-55, but the Rams would like to remedy that situation and make their own appearance in the finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Capital Prep (1-2 overall) and 2022 tournament runner-up Simsbury (0-3) drew the early game today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This should be a classic bout between the two Bristol programs and you know the only thing for certain when the two teams square off is that nothing’s for certain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won the last showdown between the programs in 2022-23 and the team hopes to make it two-in-a-row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s dig into Wednesday’s big bout as Bristol Central attempts to hand Bristol Eastern its first loss this season:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central&nbsp;Boys Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*Head Coach:&nbsp;</strong>Tim Barrette</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*Players to Watch&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carmelo Thompson (jr, guard), Mike McMahon (sr, guard), Joey Pikiell (jr, guard), Harry Ross (sr, forward/center), Jaysun Dominguez (sr, guard), Quincy Lawson (so, forward), Gavin Chamberlin (so, guard), Cody Roy (so, guard), Nate Ortiz (jr, forward).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*<strong>Spotlight on Bristol Central</strong>: Mikey McMahon, senior.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, McMahon is the leading scorer on the squad, posting 11.7 points-per-game and is the program’s top marksmen from downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s plenty of even-stephen scoring on this squad and McMahon might have to post a new career-high in order to help his mates top Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the squad’s first win over Maloney, defense fueled the day as McMahon – on the flip side – contributed 12 points to the victorious effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, he’s scored in double-figures in every game he’s played in so far. That includes 12 points against East Catholic – the state’s top program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been knocking on the varsity window since his sophomore year, posting 7.3 points-per-game as a junior, hitting a career and team-high 28 three-pointers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McMahon can rebound a bit too and Eastern will have to be wary of his outside shooting touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been there and done that and will be looking for a big game against the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*<strong>Under-the-radar Guy:&nbsp;</strong>Joey Pikiell</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell had a bit of a rough start to the season in the opener versus RHAM but ended up dropping 11 points on East Catholic – flipping down three 3-pointers against the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, much like McMahon, Pikiell can really get rolling once his 3-ball is hitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s currently second on the squad in three-pointers made and we’ve all seen him hit big three-point bombs last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, against the Lancers exactly one year ago, he canned a huge 3 in front of the Central bench as the squad nearly pulled off the win over its crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell can be a big time difference on the hardwood and Eastern cannot give him open looks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*<strong>Watch out for:&nbsp;</strong>Carmelo Thompson&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This baller has the ability to heat up in a hurry and we saw that on display already this season at RHAM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central rolled out to a 13-2 lead to start the game with Thompson in attack mode, scoring eight points over first quarter play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He netted a team season-high 15 points while grabbing nine rebounds – nearly tallying a double-double in that opening day contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson has an underrated passing game and when he goes strong to the hoop, he can finish with the best of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hoopster can hit from long range (11 three-pointers last season) and is capable of a 20-point game on any given night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He notched over 200 points in 2022-23, averaging 10.1 ppg, and has every intention in giving Eastern plenty of fits tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about the hustle from Harry Ross, Jaysun Dominguez, Quincy Lawson, Gavin Chamberlin, Cody Roy and Nate Ortiz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong>Central is on its home turf and this won’t be an easy game for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will hustle on defense, keep within its offense and cannot let the emotion of the game distract the players on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Tim Barrette and Eastern coach Bunty Ray have been there and done that against each other over the years and expect another tit-for-tat battle between the veteran coaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If McMahon, Pikiell, Thompson and company can make stops and hit the long ball, the Rams have a good chance in this one.</p>
