<p>MERIDEN – Over a spirited first half of basketball on Monday, the boys team from Bristol Eastern kept pace with Platt, going toe-to-toe against a very athletic foe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers couldn’t keep up the momentum going over second half play, leading to a tough 73-47 setback in CCC South play from Orville T. Platt High School in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (8-5) hung with Platt (11-2) over first half action as multiple passes kept the Panthers moving their feet defensively and when the Lancers had open looks, the visitors were able to bury shots from inside and out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were able to flash the middle, get some baskets inside, get some perimeter shots outside,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “We were definitely flowing on offense. But it wasn’t one dimensional. To play a team like that, you have to take what they give you. They pressured us, we were able to get the ball inside, we sat back, we made the extra pass, and got the ball reversals.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, the Platt duo of Makahi Anderson (game-high 25 points) and Anthony Nimani (21 points) along with Jason Delavante (13 points between second and third quarter play), made all the big shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio was big, physical and presented challenges the Lancers simply couldn’t answer over second half play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at least early on, it was Platt who was chasing and unable to turn over the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers jumped out to an 8-4 push halfway through the first quarter before Eastern’s offensive execution put the home team quickly behind the eight ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D’Amato (six points, three rebounds) started a 9-0 burst with a blistering 3, Zaveyn Tate (11 points, six rebounds, three assists, two steals) added a lay-up, Jordan Chisholm (six points, two assists) flipped in a hoop and off two charity tosses by Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum (six points, four rebounds), Eastern’s edge reached 13-8 with 2:38 remaining in the first.</p>

<p>Platt closed the deficit to 13-11 late in the frame but Nate Fries (career-high 11 points, three 3-pointers, three rebounds, three steals), nailed two three-point bombs over a stretch of 28 seconds as the Kingstreeters led 19-13 through eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was outstanding,” said Ray of Fries. “He’s a senior, it’s the second half of the season and that’s what I expect out of him. He was most impressive about his shot selection. That’s why he ended up getting baskets. The last couple games, I’ve been talking to him about shooting. I don’t mind him shooting. He can shoot the ball. He was trying to force his offense. Today, he was the open man, he was knocking down shots but he was also rebounding. He’s been feeling pretty good about everything he was doing out there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern surged in front 24-19 on a Brayden Dauphinais (six points, three rebounds) drive with 3:38 to play before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turnovers slowly changed the completion of the showdown for the Lancers as Platt retook the lead (24-23) off a&nbsp;Nimani&nbsp;lay-in with 2:29 remaining in the second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later on, Dauphinais unleashed a baseline 3 and when Chisholm canned two free throws with 1:11 before intermission, the contest was all knotted up at 29-29.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the home team used a 27-5 run, started by a put-back from Delavante and when Nimani dropped in a bucket with 20 seconds to go in the third period, the home program snared a 56-34 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just in the third quarter alone, Platt outscored Eastern by 17 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been our demise all year against teams like this,” said Ray of Eastern’s third quarter woes. “You’re doing everything you can for a half. I wish we didn’t even had to go into the locker room. I wish we just kept playing because every time we play a team like this, we get worn down. And then we take a breath, come out and don’t match the other team’s intensity, it becomes difficult.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I say in most of our losses, the third quarter’s an issue.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth, Platt nearly upped the advantage to 30 points late in the frame but D’Amato splashed in another 3, Tate dropped in a field goal and hit 3-of-4 free throws, Fries added two free throws, Chisholm flipped in one final hoop and Mickey Sherrill saw his first varsity action for Eastern as&nbsp;the Panthers won the contest 73-47.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[When] you’re being pressured like that, it’s hard to get shots,” said Ray. “So the ones you get are probably forced and rushed and unless you have a playmaker that can do something, and Platt has three of them, [it’s challenging]. They have two All-Staters, probably, and two other kids…that can make a basket.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have some good players but we have to score within our offense right now. Going up against that, you can’t get an easy one inside because they’re gigantic and outside, your guards are having a hard time penetrating and you’re just tired and you’re forced into 3s and they’re tired 3s.” &nbsp;</p>
