<p>The field is set for the CIAC football playoffs which commences this coming Tuesday from the home site of the higher seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All six divisions saw the top eight teams qualify for the postseason over a loaded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s some intriguing match ups despite no local team qualifying for the state tournament this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Class L, Bristol Central finished in 21st place overall with 495 points (49.5 average) and was the only program that finished at 2-8 in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then over in Class MM, Bristol Eastern ended the year in 20th place, garnering 585 total points - carrying a 3-7 ledger that tied St. Paul Catholic for the best record in the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons, competing in Class S, finished with 670 points - good for 14th place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even in the expanded field, some divisions had a number of squads earn a home seed - a top-four ranking - despite multiple losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, over in Class LL, Southington (9-1) is the top ranked opponent while Greenwich, the runner up, finished 8-2 with losses to both the Knights and Staples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Class L saw four teams earn home berths - including No. 3 Maloney - with 9-1 records. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Class MM is ultra competitive, having three undefeated squads in the mix along with No. 3 Killingly at 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Berlin (10-0) in Class M, the bracket is a bit skewed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notre Dame-West Haven is the second seed at 7-3 while No. 8 Branford - playing a tough schedule - snuck in at .500 (5-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Branford is the only squad with a .500 record to qualify for postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the teams in Class SS carry at least an 8-2 ledger with top-ranked Cromwell/Portland (9-1) leading the charge while in Connecticut’s smallest division, undefeated Ansonia is two games better than second ranked Bloomfield (8-2) in Class S.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
