<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern softball team decided to take on CCC interdivisional competitor South Windsor under the lights of Casey Field in Bristol on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers defeated the Bobcats in a romp. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four run first was all Eastern needed to stave off South Windsor but 18 runs later, the Kingstreeters - ironically not playing on King Street that night - leveled the Bobcats by a 22-3 final.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second win of the season for Eastern (2-3) while South Windsor fell to 0-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior pitcher Ashley Serafin threw a solid four innings of work for Eastern, allowing seven hits, two earned runs, three walks and fanning four to snare the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Bobcats made seven errors in the field and Eastern capitalized on most of those gaffes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Eastern zipped up 21 hits, including eight for extra bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Kayla Webber went a perfect 4-for-4 with two runs scored while Jazmyn Brown had a game as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She went 3-of-4 with a double, triple and two runs scored.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Valentine also smashed out three hits which included a double and three runs scored, Serafin went 2-for-4 with a triple and two RBI and Gracie Browne was 2-for-4 with three runs scored and three RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makayla Antunes went a slick 2-of-3 which included a home run, two runs scored and four RBI while Hailey Beebe truly had a day at the dish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beebe scooped up three hits, tallied both a triple and a home run while just missing out on a half-dozen RBI day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She led the squad with five RBI that evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor grabbed two first inning runs but the program was outscored 22-1 from that point on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers added eight runs to the board in the second frame and in the third tilt, the home team zipped up 10 runs - capturing a 22-2 cushion through three completed frames, eventually leading to the 19-run triumph.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin was at it again on Saturday, helping the Lancers to a 6-5 victory over St. Paul Catholic in city series action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She struck out four to earn the back-to-back win for the Lancers, now 3-3 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin allowed 11 hits, five earned runs, walked two and while she held her own in the circle, her teammates supported her at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne slammed out a two-run homer to give Eastern the lead for good late in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a good back-and-forth contest as Eastern led 1-0 out the gate but trailed 3-1 through one completed frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers later roped up three third inning runs to retake the edge at 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, Eastern kicked in the go-ahead runs, snaring a 6-1 push and held on for the eventual win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kate Marchak, Bella McCulloch, and Stella Boucino each tallied two hits apiece for St. Paul Catholic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons fell to 4-4 overall while the Lancers are back to .500 with some big showdowns on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>
