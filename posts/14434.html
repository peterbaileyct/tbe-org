<p>The 131 recipients of a total of $280,600 in scholarships include students in various stages of their academic careers who will be continuing their education with the help of these scholarships in the fields of business, healthcare, criminal justice, journalism, education, engineering, visual arts, skilled trades and so many more.</p>

<p>The scholarships are awarded from funds administered by the Community Foundation, which were established by local individuals, families and businesses to support the academic and career dreams of students in Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington and Wolcott. </p>

<p>All scholarships are awarded through a competitive, blinded application process and are available to students at varying levels of their academic careers within the Foundation’s service area, as well as several other communities.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access ten (10) articles per week.</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email editor@bristoledition.org for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write editor@bristoledition.org to be considered for free access.</em></p>
