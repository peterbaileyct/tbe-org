<p>The 2004 Bristol American Legion baseball team won the state championship and came within one game of winning the Northeast Regionals and going to Oregon for the American Legion World Series. it was a remarkable season for a talented and dedicated team.</p>

<p>After winning a difficult Zone One championship, outlasting talented teams from Simsbury and Southington, Bristol zipped right through the state tournament, beating Trumbull, Norwalk, Orange, East Hartford, and Simsbury in the final by a score of 5-3 for the State Championship. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Regional, Bristol defeated Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. But the team from Maine was exceptional, coming out of the loser’s bracket and sweeping a doubleheader from Bristol to win the Regional. Maine then went on to sweep the American Legion World Series in Oregon.</p>

<p>The loss in the finals of the Regionals does not diminish how special this Bristol team was. As Coach Spec Monaco was tossing batting practice on Tuesday, assistant coach Hal Kilby talked about the group out on the field.</p>

<p>“Not only was this group talented; they were great kids too. So we just had a fun year…We knew we were in a special place.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kilby went on to say, “There was pressure, there were expectations, but we had confidence. We knew, you know, we could play. We had a lot of depth on the pitching staff. Just great kids. You know, practice was fun, games were fun.”  </p>

<p>The offense in 2004 was led in multiple categories by Matt Arburr, who led the team in runs (59), hits (72), batting average (.436), doubles (18), triples (7), home runs (10), and RBI’s (62). That is 62 RBI’s in only 52 games. Other than that he did not do much to contribute.</p>

<p>On the field on Tuesday, the players, now in their late 30’s, still had a spring in their step. Drew Sgro even launched one over the fence in right during B.P., causing Monico to comment, “Where was that in 2004?”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the children of the players accompanied them on the field, taking part in the warm-up tosses and then watching their dads from the stands.</p>
