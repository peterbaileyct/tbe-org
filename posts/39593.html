<p>NORTHAMPTON, MASS. -- Only 10 players in the history of the University of St. Joseph women’s basketball program have scored 1,000 career points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And former Bristol Eastern standout Jordan Ouellette is one of those outstanding individuals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the final day of the 2023 calendar year, the Blue Jays took part of the Smith Holiday Classic from the Ainsworth Gymnasium in Northampton, Mass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph ended up falling to Mass-Dartmouth by an 87-80 final, dropping the Bluejays to 10-3 overall while the Corsairs improved to 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was still a banner day for the Bristol native. (In addition, Ouellete was also named the University of St. Joseph and Hartford HealthCare athlete of the month for December.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 3:59 remaining in first half, Ouellette dropped in a jumper to snare her 1,000th point -- an amazing accomplishment at any level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 33 from West Hartford ended the game with 15 points and nine rebounds over another solid effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the completion of the contest, she had 1,004 points to her name and will continue to build upon that impressive tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took her just 65 games to compile all those points, making 61 starts over her three seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouellette has played in every game to date for the Blue Jays, posting a team-high 16.2 points-per-game on tremendous 49.2-percent shooting from the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also collects 7.6 rebounds and 1.8 assists-per-game while hitting 76-percent of her free throws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior averages 31.7 minutes-per-game, leading her squad in that category as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s been a mainstay with the Blue Jays since leaving Bristol Eastern where she also scored over 1,000 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ouellette hates going downtown</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s an amazing statistic that’s seemingly missing when talking about Ouellette’s amazing numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All her points have come from two-point range as the forward has only attempted six three-pointers in her career - making none of those long range attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, that might make one of her favorite players in the NBA - Boston Celtics superstar Jason Tatum - a bit mad because he shoots a boatload of three-pointers every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not Ouellette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even at Bristol “Eastern, those long range, not-so-accurate shots were not part of her vocabulary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what makes Ouellette a throwback of the best kind, a time when basketball was civilized and programs didn’t chuck up 27 three-pointers in a game (just to make four).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouellette rarely attempted 3s from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Eastern for that matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of all time rankings at Eastern, Ouellette hit three career 3-pointers - good for 49th place all time in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Lancers’ girls basketball program has drained 1,400+ three-pointers since the inception of the three-point line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She just didn’t attempt many 3s and even as Ouellette transitioned from point guard to small forward, incorporating three-pointers into her repertoire was not part of her skillset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wheeling and dealing at BE</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouellette was a tough competitor at Eastern, hitting the court over several games for the Lancers as a freshmen before quickly moving into the startling line-up soon after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She ended her scholastic career with 1,013 points, ninth all-time in Eastern school history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sport Management Major needs just nine points to surpass her scholastic totals and those should come in the first game the Blue Jays play in 2024.</p>
