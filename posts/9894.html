<p>Last week, the new Bristol City Council, in a decision that left many City Hall observers dumbfounded, voted down the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the City of Bristol and Wheeler Clinic, Inc. The no vote undid months of work the previous administration and council accomplished while tarnishing the city by abandoning a handshake deal that was in place and only needed signatures.</p>

<p>Sebastian Panioto, along with Mayor Jeff Caggiano, was the only yes-votes. During the meeting, Panioto saw the benefits of a project that was ready to go and would bring 200 jobs to the downtown area.</p>

<p>It's been nearly a week since the controversial vote, and the tremors are still felt with a robust discussion on social media. For Councilman Panioto, though, he told the TBE that the council remains committed to Wheeler despite their decision, "We're still committed to Wheeler and finding them a suitable home that fits the need of consolidating their current locations here in Bristol. They continue to provide a vital service for the community, one that's growing in importance. I've been in contact with them, and they've been gracious in taking the next steps after Tuesday's meeting."</p>

<p>Those who voted no said they were listening to their constituents that want entertainment downtown. Where do the mayor and city council go from here when brick and mortar retail establishments are struggling? Panioto believes the administration, along with Bristol&nbsp;Economic and Community Development Director&nbsp; Justin Malley, can get something done, "I'm confident we can attract more parties to downtown and continue the momentum that's been created, and that work is continuous."</p>

<p>Councilman Panioto spoke effectively at the council meeting about Wheeler's importance to the community, especially concerning mental health crises, "I'm trying to make this decision based on a higher set of principles in terms of mental health. This All Heart behind us that's on every memo, I think we run counter to that when we make that decision here tonight."</p>

<p>It is to be determined in the coming weeks and months if his colleagues will find the wisdom in his words.</p>
