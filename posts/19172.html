<p>Bristol Eastern ended the regular season on a positive note Wednesday night, sweeping three straight sets from a very competitive team in the Fitch Falcons. The first two sets were very close as the two teams searched for answers to the opponentâ€™s attack and the lead for either team never got to more than two or three points. Ultimately, the Lancers won both sets by a score of 25-23.</p>
