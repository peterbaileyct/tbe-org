<p>How many more road trips can the football program over at Bristol Eastern make this season?!?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like the Lancers have been stuck away from home forever but after this week’s epic challenge, Eastern will only leave Bristol one more time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the good news.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bad news is the opponent of the week is Berlin, who is undefeated.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Berlin has walked a fine line to get to 4-0 and if Eastern can show up to the game healthy, or more so than usual, the Kingstreeters are going to bring the battle to Sage Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to look for on Friday:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (0-4) at Berlin (4-0) – CCC Tier III Challenge</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>7 p.m. (Scalise Field - Turf Field Sage Park Stadium)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: The Redcoats hold a 4-1 edge over the Lancers in series play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Eastern win over Berlin:&nbsp;</strong>The Lancers scooped up a 21-13 victory over the Redcoats back on September 13, 2014,from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>Berlin was able to hang a huge loss on Bloomfield, snaring a tremendous 37-34 victory on the road. On the flip side, Eastern led 8-6 at the half at Avon but ended up falling by a 24-8 final.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Facts: </strong>This road trip of doom finally ends after Eastern squares off against Berlin. Eastern had four straight contests on the road and is looking forward to a little home cooking after the bye week…But first, it’s another tough CCC showdown versus a very good Berlin program…The Redcoats are a dual threat in terms of their offense…Senior quarterback Lorenzo Miele can flat-out throw the ball, making 35-of-64 passes for 562 yards (16.0 yards-per-throw). He has five TD passes on the year and shares the wealth among three receivers that have all tallied at least 106 yards…Senior Luke Maguder (six catches, 131 yards), junior Eli Santos (5-106) and sophomore Kyle Melville (12-160) all have a touchdown to their name this year…Senior Josh Grimm has nabbed three passes for 68 yards and three touchdowns. Every time he touches the ball, he scores…Berlin has scooped up 6.2 yards-per-carry, led by senior Josh Clement (37 carries, 323 yards, 5 TDs)…Senior Will Gomes averages 10.0 tackles-per-game is tough at both middle linebacker and fullback…Eastern’s injuries have caught up with the program but this team continues to compete, continues to fight…Back Jaiden Fore went down against Avon before the completion of the first half but rushed for 64 yards and a TD. His injury zapped the offense but senior Josh Aubin held the fort and nearly tallied fifty yards over an emergency fill-in situation…Alex Corvo, still filling in for injured quarterback Kamden Laprise, has been under fire from the start but managed to make 4-of-9 passes against the Falcons…Defensively, the Lancers were good against Avon – limiting the program to zero third down completions and just 12 points with under five minutes to play…Three turnovers did not help matters against the Falcons while the Kingstreeters were limited to just 27 yards in offense over second half play…Adam Zavecz led Eastern in tackles with 7.5 while Rayshon Andrews (seven tackles) also helped make critical stops at Avon…Austin Shorette had his first sack of the campaign while Michael Sherrill helped Eastern snare a safety over first period play against Avon…This thing is eventually going to turn around for Eastern but the contest against Berlin is going to be a tough one no matter who takes the field. </p>
