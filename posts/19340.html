<p>In 2021, the Bristol Bulldogs cheerleaders D8 team advanced to the AYC National Championship in Florida, in which they placed 6th out of 19 teams. They are hoping to have the same type of success this year.<br><br>This year, the D8 &amp; D12 cheer teams kicked off their competition season with the local competition at Shelton High School. The younger D8 lady Bulldogs jump-started the competition with the first performance for Bristol, and the older girls (D12) came on later in the afternoon to finish out the day with another strong performance. Both teams finished with a 2nd place award!  <br></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
