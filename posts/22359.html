<p>BRISTOL - The Platt wrestling program, along with Berlin, are the current leaders in the CCC South to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Thursday night, the Panthers put that undefeated ledger on the line against the determined crew from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams ended up dropping a tough 53-27 decision from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt (20-4) won for the 20th time overall this season and improved to a sterling 4-0 mark in CCC South action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams fell to 9-2 overall and 3-2 in the South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central earned points over several weight classes which included a win at 113 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaden Dragon earned a hard-fought 8-4 decision over Platt’s Cesar Rodriguez and then at 120 pounds, Central’s Joseph Niek pinned Nathaniel Ortiz in 4:22.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also scooping up victories for the Rams was Landon Dionne (145) via pin-fall over Julius Ortiz in 3:07 while at 195, Johnny Rios nabbed the pin against Emmanuel Lugo in only 29 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attempting to match that feat was Central’s Andrew Sarkis (285) and the heavyweight wasted little time in his bout against Isaiah Smith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarkis snared the pin in 56 seconds but the Rams dropped the overall decision to a surging Platt program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Saturday’s bout at Ridgefield, Central has a huge CCC Interdivisional tilt against Southington on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is at 6 p.m. from Southington High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget on Wednesday, February 8, it’s Central/Eastern from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in what should be a packed house.</p>
