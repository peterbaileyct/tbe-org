<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;There was plenty of holiday cheer when the Bristol Central girls basketball team opened play at the annual BC Holiday Classic on Wednesday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams notched the first 15 points of the game against Platt, turning their full-court press into eventual lay-ups for easy buckets as the home team posted a 69-25 win from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (3-2) led from the opening tip as Nicole Riemer scored all of her career-high 24 points over a stretch of 17 minutes - not allowing the Panthers (0-5) any kind of daylight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It felt good,” said Riemer of the win. “I think our team did a good job working together and sharing the ball.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a complete share-a-thon - starting with some excellent defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivia Louis (five points) hit the court several times in pursuit of the ball, Leilani Jackson added eight big points and plenty of defense while Arianna Rivera (14 points) netted eight second period points to help lead the charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was an] outstanding effort in the first half defensively,” said Central coach Steve Gaudet. “Olivia Louis, diving on the floor like four or five times, those things just get the team going. Getting after loose balls gives us extra possessions. Our effort in the first half tonight was outstanding.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myah Steiner added eight points off the pine, Layman Cespedes and four, Molly McMahon added a trifecta as did Gabby Bernie over a big effort for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afia Felix had a team-high eight points while Sophia Texidor scored seven for Platt but the group was limited to just nine first half points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was steal and lay-up city for Central over that game-opening 15-0 run - tallied in just a matter of 2:09.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riemer notched nine of those points, ending the jaunt on a traditional three-point play, to give the Rams a big 15-0 cushion with 5:51 left in the first.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s been like that so far this season early on,” said Gaudet of Riemer. “She outworks everyone in practice, outworks everyone in games. She’s a tough matchup and she’s going non-stop.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She get 24 points in two quarters tonight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt hit two consecutive hoops to trim the deficit to 11 but the game was soon over a blazing 25-2 run as defense continued to fuel the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the rally, Rivera added a coast-to-coast lay-up, cashed in on two steals for hoops and finally, Riemer hit a high-percentage basket off a Rivera pass as Central’s edge ballooned to 40-6 with just under four minutes to go in the second stanza.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One final lay-up from Riemer propelled the Rams to a 46-9 halftime bulge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central then really pushed the contest into outer space, even using a couple three-point bombs to ice the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 16-2 jaunt saw Steiner connect on a lay-in, Jackson had a foul line jumper fall through the net and when Bernier and McMahon connected on back-to-back threes, Platt was down and out - trailing 62-11 with 2:58 to go in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams led 62-17 through three completed frames and extended the edge back out to 49 via a lay-up from Cespedes as Central led 67-18 with 4:40 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One final Steiner hoop ended the scoring for the Rams, leading to a huge 69-25 win, advancing the squad in tournament play - squaring off against Canton in the finals (5:30 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Being a family out there, it was a good way to spend the holiday and be together,” said Riemer of the win. &nbsp;</p>
