<p>Joseph was the loving husband of Judy Ulrich for 66 years. He served in the US Navy during the Korean War. Later he worked for Pratt &amp; Whiney Aircraft for 31 years before his retirement. He often said of those years, that he loved his job. He would say, if you love what you do, you never really work. And he loved his job.</p>

<p>Joseph was a strong and stable rock for his family and all who knew him, volunteering his time and knowledge to help others with building, project work, or anything they needed. He was always working on a project or thinking about one, whether for his home or someone else, and never liked to sit still for long. He volunteered at St Matthew Church in Bristol with fundraisers and Boy Scouts, sharing his love of the outdoors with the next generation, proving to be a patient and wise scout master.</p>

<p>Family was a central part of his life. His free time was spent with his family, helping his son with projects, spending time with his grandchildren, or with his daughter. Day trips with his wife were a frequent pleasure around New England to enjoy the scenery. He loved simple pleasures; music, day trips, and New England scenery, whether it was mountains or the ocean, as long as his wife and family was with him.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
