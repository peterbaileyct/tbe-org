<p>HARTFORD – There was a lot going on this past week in Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League play, including its annual trip to Dunkin’ Donuts Park in Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s just a quick summary of some of the highlights from a tremendous two-days of baseball action:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ray and Peters honored&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In between the two games on Thursday night, the GHTBL 2023 Hall of Fame Class was introduced for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And two locals from Bristol were part of that outstanding class.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bunty Ray and Adam Peters, two players from the Bristol Merchants for most of its run, earned their spot in the GHTBL Hall of Fame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo weren’t just teammates but friends off the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two played for more than a couple teams in the GHTBL over the years including Herb’s Sports Shop, the East Hartford Jets and the Bristol Merchants.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray and Peters have been multiple time All-Stars, GHTBL award winners and played on several championship teams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The twosome will be honored in a ceremony in November and TBE will have more on Ray and Peters over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Holowaty also honored&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former long time Eastern Connecticut State University coach Bill Holowaty was also named to the GHTBL Hall of Fame Class of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray’s collegiate coach has been involved with the GHTBL for quite some time as the President of the GHTBL and as a former player.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A former University of Connecticut men’s basketball standout, Holowaty coached the baseball program at ESCU for 45 years, helming the squad to four NCAA Division III World Series Championships – including Ray’s senior class in 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His career record for the Warriors was 1,404-525-7, a ledger that’s the top mark in New England.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holowaty was an amazing old school coach and also was the Athletic Director at ECSU, helping grow their athletic programs - including women’s sports.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The induction ceremony for the GHTBL Hall of Fame takes place on Saturday, November 18 at Indian Hills Country Club in Newington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Money raised for the Hartford PAL&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During a break of the Bristol Greeners game on night one from Dunkin’ Park on Thursday evening, the GHTBL presented a $4,000 check to the Hartford PAL.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each and every year, the teams of the GHTBL raise funds for a worthy charity or cause and the Hartford PAL was the 2023 recipient of the year’s efforts.&nbsp;</p>
