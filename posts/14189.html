<p>Come Sunday morning, I will have attended the graduation ceremony for high school where I teach, that’s on Saturday morning, and Mary and I, along with the youngest son, will make our annual stop at the Zorba 2022 Festival, the festival held at St. Demetrios Church celebrating Greek culture.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The graduation was held at Dunkin Donuts Park in Hartford on a beautiful, cool but sunny day. I love ritual and ceremony, in this instance, the walk across the outfield to our seats along third base; the playing of Pomp and Circumstance, while the students take their seats on the infield; the crowd of families and friends clapping and cheering; the speeches; and the handing out of degrees. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the venue was spectacular, yet graduating at a stadium is not a prerequisite. A high school auditorium does the job, certainly. The point is that all high school graduations have the same emotional tenor: young people coming to another rite of passage, preparing to enter a different world, pausing to reflect on the past, looking ahead to the future, savoring the moment. It’s all good.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, of course, a local church celebrating its culture through food and drink and music and dancing, year after year, accomplishes a similar tone. This time anchoring its youth and inviting the public to join them. I especially adore and appreciate the youth dressing in traditional costumes and learning traditional dances. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In both cases, the young people, most of them, fall short of grasping the significance of embracing tradition. Many balk and complain about having to participate, something which is the prerogative of youth—to complain about doing something that “doesn’t mean anything.” It’s up to the rest of us to maintain the traditions, to provide a backstop for the youth the “rebel” and then bounce back later with understanding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And of course, come Sunday, Father’s Day arrives. (Happy Father’s Day to all!) There has been a plan for the day for a while, and we will be gathering one more time with family to celebrate. It’s funny, in a nonfunny way, simply because there comes a moment when I think, there is so much to do. (Don’t I sound like those kids?) Then, it strikes me, what is better than being together, breaking bread and breaking with the routine. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Also on Sunday, for the first time, as a country together we celebrate Juneteenth, the end of slavery in United States. Last year the president signed Juneteenth into law, making it a Federal holiday. (In Connecticut, the holiday becomes official next year. This year the holiday is Monday.) Here is an instance of a new commemoration, and for some it will take time to get into the new rhythm; for others, of course, this day has been celebrated for years. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around here, the celebration takes place against a backdrop of the current scattering of white supremacist leaflets in sections of the town. While some people like to think that our history of chattel slavery and racism is a thing of the past, others know that we are still dealing with it and have a way to go before, we, as a country (and even we, as a city) reconcile and heal. Juneteenth is one piece of the puzzle that leads to a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For reading and listening this week, here’s a new one. Try The London Review of Books Podcast, specifically, "Great Replacement Theory," a racist conspiracy theory not just sweeping United States but sweeping the world. This podcast provides a world-wide perspective and a history of the conspiracy.

<p>Note: On Friday night, we attended <em>Kiss My Aztec!</em>, the Hartford Stage musical production that is on its way to Broadway. It's late in the season, I realize, but if you can get there, it is well worth it. That's it for now.</p>
