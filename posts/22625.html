<p>Bristol, to date, has pretty much-watched winter from the sidelines. However, Saturday, winter reminded the Mum City of its capabilities with temperatures diving below zero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early Saturday morning, the TBE visited Rockwell and Page Parks to see who dared to test the arctic freeze. Bristolites heeded the warnings of government officials and stayed inside mostly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, several bogies were spotted tempting the elements at Rockwell Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One was “Claire” who requested that she and her dog “Annie,” a two-year-old poodle, not be photographed.</p>

<p>Claire, who was not supposed to be outside due to her health, took Annie for her morning walk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have to do it for her," she said. “I follow her, wherever she goes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They serpentined their way to the pond and Mrs. Rockwell’s Playground before calling it a morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To combat the cold, Claire wore an extra jacket, doubled up on her gloves, and dressed Annie in an insulated doggie coat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The brutal cold coupled with the bone numbing winds posed life threatening conditions. Today, we are in for a remarkable turnaround with temperatures in the high 40s.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
