<p>The Bristol Youth Lacrosse girls Junior team played its final game of the season at Farmington last Thursday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The campaign was a very successful one overall as this was the first time Bristol was able to offer a girls team in that age group, instead of the girls playing with the boys on the same level.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And we’ve all seen what the growth of those youth lacrosse programs has done on the scholastic level between the Bristol High School programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Successful high school players like Bristol Eastern’s Vanessa Drury and Emma Stavens both got their start as fifth graders, playing with the seventh and eighth grade team, progressing on the field along the way and leaving their marks in the Lancers’ ever growing record books.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Bristol’s Makinzey Welch showed off her athleticism at the Junior level with great play in the midfield and was also a natural talent in the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow sixth graders Macey Bashaw and Alexa Wilson were dynamic in the midfield while Serena Croce was also up to the task – providing some relief on defense against Farmington's lethal offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikayla Memmot, Lauren Bell, Abigail Stavens and Zoe Martin all played multiple positions over the course of the game and season for the Bristol outfit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The coaches of the program, Junior Ramirez and John Stavens, are looking forward to another successful year as the Junior level continues to grow and improve in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTE…</strong>For those interested in dipping their toes in the lacrosse waters in town, the league will once again offer a summer session for newcomers to the sport.&nbsp;Details to follow about that exciting opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
