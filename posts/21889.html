<p>MIDDLETOWN - The Bristol Central wrestling program continues to buzz right through the 2022-23 season and this past Wednesday night, another team bit the dust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, the Rams were able to topple the outfit from Middletown - earning a big 66-12 victory in a CCC South showdown on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central improved to 8-1 overall, 2-1 in CCC South action, while Middletown fell to 2-7 (0-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams enjoyed a couple forfeits along the way but when the squad had opponents to square off against, the locals earned several trips to the pay window.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 106 pounds, Central’s Engher Disla Almonte wrangled up an 11-4 decision over Joshua Ramos while Kaden Dragon (113) earned a pinfall victory against Middletown’s D’vonte Tenn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Brendan Carmody (120), Julian Colon (126), and Luis Lumpkin (132) all won via forfeit which meant each grappler earned six points for the Rams’ till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 145 pounds, Central’s Landon Dionne zipped up a 9-2 decision over Jacob Guarino while Eric Cooper (152) did not have an opponent to square off against.</p>

<p>Central’s Lincoln Archibald (160) pulled out a pin against Sean McCall in just 2:53 while Ayden Pratt (170) was a forfeit victor.</p>

<p>The Rams’ Cole Krueger (195) pinned Shawn Roberson towards the tail end of regulation (5:37) while Johnny Rios (220) was also victorious via pinfall.</p>

<p>Rios pinned Middletown’s Kayshawn Tatum in just over ninety seconds (1:32) and then at heavyweight, Central’s Andrew Sarkis (285) pinned Zaikwan Hill in only 1:20 to net the win.</p>
