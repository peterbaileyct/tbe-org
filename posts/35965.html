<p>BURLINGTON --The boys soccer team over at Bristol Central wants to get over .500 before the postseason commences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a tremendous 3-0 shutout of Lewis Mills this past Wednesday from the Nassahegan Recreation Complex in Burlington, the squad ended up sweeping the season-series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now the Rams are just one victory away from making it an even-steven season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are now 6-7 overall with a big showdown against Bristol Eastern on deck this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Mills (6-5-3), Central’s Frank Palma -- a goal scoring machine when given space on the pitch -- scored two goals while Mason Allan added the other for the clean sweep of the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palma is a handful for the best of teams and allowing him to operate without some sort of double-team or added defenders is a risky endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central keeper Harry Ross zipped in seven saves while Marek Nardi nabbed eight for the home program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory was the second in a row for the Rams -- attempting to build some momentum as the postseason is just around the corner.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking the streak</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After defeating Glastonbury (4-3) to open the month of October, the program dropped four straight decisions - including a 2-1 setback to Eastern on Sunday, Oct. 8 -- to fall under .500 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But back-to-back triumphs against Platt (5-2) and Lewis Mills (3-0) this week has gotten the program back on track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This week, it’s BC/BE</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three matches finish out the week - and the regular season - for the program at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, the Rams are home for a CCC interdivisional challenge against Simsbury (6:30 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, on Thursday, it’s the big one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central and Eastern go to war on the turf under the lights, at 7:15 p.m. from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, in a special Saturday challenge, the Rams hit the road to battle Avon at 10 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it’s about the build-up to the postseason and Central is in the thick of things once again.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
