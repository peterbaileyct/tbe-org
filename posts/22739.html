<h2>American Legion seeking WW II veterans to sign commemorative quilt</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The local American Legion Seicheprey Post 2 is encouraging World War II veterans to attend, and to sign a commemorative quilt at, its Iwo Jima/World War II Veteran Reunion on Feb. 19, at 2 p.m., at the Bristol Public Library, according to Neal Supranovich.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supranovich has been involved with the quilt project since 2019, when he chaired, and was the sole member of, the Bristol Hometown Hero Committee. </p>

<p>In 2019 the Hometown Hero Committee, working with the Korean Veterans Association, chose to pursue the creation of a quilt honoring the 4,762 Bristolites who served in World War II and the 169 Bristolites who lost their lives in that war, according to Supranovich who sent TBE a detailed account via email. In a follow up conversation, Supranovich provided more information.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, the group "Quilts of Valor" was approached to make a quilt for the signing, but their charter would not allow them to do it. An individual quilter from Maine stepped forward and donated a used quilt, which a volunteer drove all the way up to Maine and brought it back to Bristol for a ceremony prior to the official opening of the Mum Festival in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a ceremony before the official opening of the 2019 Mum Festival, nine World War II veterans signed the quilt. Between the Mum Festival and Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, Dec. 7, 2019, Supranovich gathered more signatures. The quilt was presented on Dec. 7 by the late Art Ward, as chair of the local veterans committee, to the Bristol Hospital with plans to display it there. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hospital requested more signatures. Supranovich did what he could to gather more of them, traveling to nursing care centers and several American Legion breakfasts. As happens, the plan fell apart when the employee guiding the project took another job, and the quilt wound up back with Supranovich a month ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All World War II veterans are invited to sign the quilt on Feb. 19, as part of the Iwo Jima World War II Veterans Reunion which will feature, among other events, the presentation of a limited edition print of a painting of local World War II veteran, Joe Caminiti, to Caminiti.</p>

<p><em>Editor's note: This story has been amended to include the information about the quilt being in storage at Bristol Hospital.</em></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
