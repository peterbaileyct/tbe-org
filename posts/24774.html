<p>When Erika Stirk was attending Culinary School at Bristol Technical Education Center, she dreamed of owning her own bakery. More than 15 years later, the Bristol resident’s treats have become fan favorites in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love making specialty cakes,” said Stirk. “When someone orders a cake, I try to bring their happiness alive.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stirk is the owner of Bakery on Maple, an artisanal micro bakery located on Federal Hill, which she runs with her husband, David Landi. With state funds, they are about to start on a new venture involving cupcakes and vending machines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We purchased a vending machine,” said Stirk about the new initiative. “This is our next venture to try to get Bakery on Maple not just in Federal Hill but all across Bristol, maybe Hartford, West Hartford. We’re going to put cupcakes, cookies, brownies and dog treats in the vending machine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new vending machine is scheduled to arrive this week. Stirk and Landi are scouting locations for it. In addition to the vending machine, the couple also used money from the loan to purchase a transport vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s expanding our area where we can attract people,” said Stirk. “Getting our vending machines out there and having the transport vehicles so we can do more wholesale accounts, gets us around not just Bristol, but Hartford County.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz (D) and State Rep. Mary Fortier (D, District 79) visited Bakery on Maple on Monday afternoon to celebrate the occasion and draw attention to the state's Boost program for small businesses and nonprofits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I live within walking distance,” said Fortier. “The bread is delicious and every pastry I’ve ever tried here is delicious. I try to support them whenever I can.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stirk and Landi recently received&nbsp;a $100,000 loan through the Connecticut Small Business Boost Fund to finance the company's expansion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wish you every success,” said Bysiewicz. “This is very exciting.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croissants, pastries, cookies and breads are just a few of the goodies that Stirk and Landi have made available to their customers since opening their doors in May of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We pretty much live here,” said Stirk. “We come in at 2 or 3 in the morning. I like to have my cakes be as fresh as humanly possible, so nothing goes into the freezer. Everything is baked that morning and I decorate until the time they walk in.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Stirk strives to provide the freshest treats to her customers, the local business owner said that giving back to the Bristol community is especially important. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the ways that Bakery on Maple provides support to local residents is through Cupcakes for a Cause. This month’s recipient will be Emma, a young woman living with Autism, ADHD and Anxiety, who is raising funds for a service dog that will help improve her quality of life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We ask the person that we chose to pick a cupcake,” said Stirk. “Emma chose a chocolate cupcake with purple buttercream and silver sprinkles, and at the end of this month all proceeds from them will go to Emma.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any little bits we can do to help, we’re here for,” added Stirk. “We had a lot of help getting here; we’re trying to help everyone else too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Boost Fund for Connecticut Small Businesses and Nonprofits has lent $24 million dollars to 190 businesses since its launch in July of 2022. The loans can be between $5,000 and $500,000 with a 4.5 percent fixed rate, and business owners have 60 to 72 months to pay them back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bakery on Maple is open to the public from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday through Sunday, with Monday through Thursday hours dedicated to making specialty cakes for customers, cupcakes and birthday cakes for Bell City Diner and fresh breads for local food trucks and restaurants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
