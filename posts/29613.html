<p><strong>MENTEE ON A LAKE COMPOUNCE ADRENILIN RUSH RIDE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thanks to the generosity of Mike Stacy and Mary Scanlon, co-hosts of WRCH-FM’s weekday morning drive time radio show, 40 “Bigs” (adult mentors) and “Littles” (the children they mentor) from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Connecticut received free summer day passes to Bristol-based Lake Compounce – home of more than 40 attractions and the site of North America’s oldest, continuously-operated amusement park.  Posing for a photo, before putting their bravery to the ultimate test with a ride on the 15-story-tall Phobia Phear roller coaster, are Big Brother Bob Weiss (left) from Harwinton and his Little Brother, 11-year-old Nathaniel (right), from Torrington. Phobia Phear is the first ride of its kind in New England, and the first triple launch roller coaster in the northeast. Bob Weiss and Nathaniel have been matched with the well-known youth mentoring organization since 2022.
