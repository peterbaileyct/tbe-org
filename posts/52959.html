<p>Greetings,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition is planning to run our candidate questionnaire this coming Sunday -- despite early voting having already started the previous week. (Included in this email thread are all local candidates, even those who do not have an opponent this election.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you would return your answers, along with a head and shoulder photo (300x300 dpi), by Saturday, Oct. 26, by noon, we would appreciate it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with your headshot, please provide a short statement on what qualifies you to represent your constituents. The statement should not be more than 100 words. The bio is considered a separate word count from your response to the question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The total word count for your response to the question should be no more than three hundred (300) words, i.e., not three (300) words per issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Question: What are your top three (or up to three but no more than three) issues this election and why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your participation. Any questions, please email and one of us will be back to you asap.</p>

<p>I have lived, worked, played, and volunteered in Bristol for more than 35 years. During that time, I served our community as Registrar of Voters and President of the Pequabuck River Watershed Association. With my background and love for our town, I believe I can help this community and create a healthier Bristol. As a finance manager and outdoor enthusiast, I will help curb costs and offer creative, sustainable solutions to problems. Let’s invest in improving the health of our community for now and seven future generations.</p>

<p><strong>What are your top three (or up to three but no more than three) issues this election?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an Independent State Representative candidate for the 77th house district in Bristol, I believe we should invest in improving the health of our community and our environment, in programs that uplift residents with dignity and compassion, and in programs that support the wealth and wellbeing of small businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has been my honor to meet many neighbors for the first time while campaigning this year. Thank you for talking to me from the upstairs window, through ring-type apps, as well as in person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having heard your stories, I will advocate for programs that improve the lives of my constituents through increased opportunities for education, training, and employment in technology and building trades jobs; through programs that lower housing costs and freeze property tax for seniors, through programs that reduce health care costs for small businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the Pequabuck River in Forestville north to encompass the Coppermine Brook and the Northeast Neighborhood, then heading west to cover Freeman Hill Brook and the Edgewood District, then northwest up Chippens Hill to stop at the Plymouth border. That’s the geography of our district. It contains a wealth of water, a few beautiful, conserved properties, and a variety of great parks. I look forward to working with all of you to improve the lives, health, and safety of all in our community.</p>

<p>As State Representative Mary Fortier is the House Vice Chair for the Aging Committee, and a member of the Higher Ed and Employment Advancement Committee and Human Services Committee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>Mary served on the Bristol City Council for eight years serving on multiple committees, including Salary, Public Works, Water and Sewer, and Disability Commission. Both of Mary's siblings are disabled so her lived experience informs her work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary currently serves as President of the Board of HRA, the community action agency serving the Bristol area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary is a retired attorney who spent most of her career with the State of Connecticut Judicial branch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary has been married over 40 years to her husband, David. They raised six children together and are proud grandparents to four grandchildren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your top three (or up to three but no more than three) issues this election?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This election, more than most, centers on the economy and unprecedented inflation that has affected all of us. Inflation is worldwide and has lots of causes. Government, especially state government, does not have direct control over inflation. What the state can do is assist with programs and services that help our residents cope with economic struggles. Connecticut cut state income taxes over a billion dollars in the last couple years. We have increased funding to our non-profits that help our most vulnerable. We have increased programs that help families with childcare. We have more work to do and if I am re-elected I will continue fighting for families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seniors would be another top issue for me, as seniors are hit proportionally harder by inflation as most are on fixed incomes. As Vice-Chair of Aging for the last two years I have worked on meaningful legislation to make nursing homes and homecare more accountable and provide high quality care to all seniors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No 1 issue that I have heard from voters, as I campaigned, was Eversource bills. The cost of energy in Connecticut is expensive and the spike in bills this summer is complicated, and like inflation, doesn't have a quick fix. I will certainly support strengthening PURA, which regulates our utility companies, and advocate for a consumer-focused approach to reducing energy costs. I will always support continued state funding for Fuel/Energy assistance and continued programs to weatherize our homes and businesses to reduce usage and costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope to be re-elected, and I will always continue to fight for the best quality of life for Bristol residents.</p>
