<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even after Bristol Central’s&nbsp;basketball center Julius Powell&nbsp;tore his ACL playing football for the school as a senior in 2022, more than a couple colleges were still interested with his hardwood abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell rehabbed his knee and even off that injury, the men’s basketball program from Connecticut College committed to the big man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the senior only scored two points in the final regular season game against Bristol Eastern last year, the 6-foot-9, 250 pound forward/center made enough of an impression over his junior campaign to sign the dotted line to play at Connecticut College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a great signing by the program and Powell should fit in well with the collegiate team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that grueling knee injury, Powell was able to retake the court on the scholastic level just once - starting the final BC/BE showdown on February 20 from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a fitting moment for the hard-working big man, Powell posted a quick hoop, coming right out of the game to a standing ovation at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there were enough flashes during his junior campaign - on a team that was a prefect 28-0 and went all the way to the CIAC Division II championship - to make the signing by Connecticut College a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell did a tremendous job backing up a 7-foot-2 All-Stater by the name of Donovan Clingan for a couple seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the current UConn center got in foul trouble or needed a break, Powell was always up for the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, he saw some minutes during the point of a game when the score was already out of reach for opponents, but there were bouts of tremendous play in crunch time that showed Powell could compete at the next level (<em>buy my book ‘Dream Team’ for further reading on Powell’s exploits during his junior campaign).  </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And forget about his 2.4 points-per-game because his value went far beyond a bucket per game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who banged and challenged Clingan during practices in the midst of Central’s championship run?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning practice was a huge deal and the Rams - and Powell - did that on a daily basis under the watchful eye of head coach Tim Barrette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His defense was undeniable as Central went from a 7-foot-2 center to a 6-foot-9 backup - not an easy proposition to handle if you were the opposing team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was that positional defense that every school wish they could have enjoyed out of their backup center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had two of those giants who could man the paint, grab rebounds and block shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the offensive flashes Powell showed as a junior made a loud impression of the player that he could become at the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For sure, he would have been a CCC South, All Conference player - averaging a double-double over his senior campaign if it weren’t for the injury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also would have helped the Rams navigate the tough waters of CIAC Division I basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout his junior campaign, there were enough sample spaces to keep colleges interested in Powell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After opening the season with a blitzing of Southington from Trinity College, Central battled East Catholic on December 20, 2021, from Mohegan Sun Arena - pitting two of the best teams in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan got into foul trouble during second half play, Powell came in, connected on a couple second half hoops and off his second bucket, a put-back on his own miss, the Rams nabbed a huge 57-40 edge with 7:29 left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, saddled with those four fouls, saw Central eventually etch up a 19-point edge with Powell in the middle of everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think Connecticut College took note of that televised performance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell then added eight points against Eastern eight days later and played big minutes in the 53-44 victory over Springfield Central on January 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his final regular season game as a junior, he added another eight points in the rematch against Eastern on February 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Powell netted 61 points over 20 games for a regular season average of 3.0 ppg as he backed up Clingan who, sometimes, never left the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Powell is going to have a chance to resume his basketball career at the collegiate level and Connecticut College should be a perfect fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut went 14-11 overall last season, going a combined 11-3 at home and neutral sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The college, based out of New London, is a member of the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), a NCAA Division III program.</p>
