<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Central boys basketball team continues to pay the price when it comes to the opposition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad continues to compete in that ‘Donovan Clingan’ schedule that sees the Rams battles some of the state’s best competition in the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is currently 2-3 overall, dropping decisions against CCC interdivisional opponents RHAM (65-48) and East Catholic (74-46) on the road and fell to rival Bristol Eastern (52-49) in a back-and-forth showdown at the BC Holiday Classic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I believe the teams that beat us were 12-1 combined and two out of those three [losses] came on the road,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “I told our guys we had to get through that early stretch.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s exactly what the program did, taking its lumps against very good competition and eventually, start to defend its home court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that loss to the Lancers, the Rams responded with a slick 78-41 victory over Capital Prep in the consolation round of the Bristol Central Holiday Classic last Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big showing for the Rams as sharpshooter Mikey McMahon, posting a 20 spot against the Trailblazers -- the first 20-point game for any player on the squad this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be the first of many for McMahon and once the senior is in a shooting groove, he can hit shots from as far as Lake Compounce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming slate…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central starts the New Year on Wednesday against Middletown (6:45 p.m.) from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium - the beginning of a huge cluster of home contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday’s bout is a big one and the Rams will have a good chance to topple the Blue Dragons (1-3 overall) with another sterling effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a coach, I’d love to get that Middletown [game] on Wednesday,” said Barrette. “It’s a big game for them. It’s a big game for us. It will be a high intensity game for sure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, pesky Lewis Mills comes to town (6:45 p.m.) before the Rams have its only road game in the month of January (January 9 at Newington).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Newington challenge, Central is home for six straight over an amazing slate of showdowns from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In January, Platt, non-conference challenger Xavier, Hall, East Hartford and Berlin all travel to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium while the Rams start February in Bristol against Southington (February 1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that slew of games, Barrette hopes to draw even in the win/loss department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we can get back to .500, I told you we’re going to get better every game,” said Barrette. “You can see it along the way. We’re improving daily and when you don’t have a lot of experience, that’s what happens. They’re a great group.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know one thing, these guys come to practice and they play hard.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who is scoring what?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off that sterling 20-point effort against Capital Prep, McMahon is now averaging 11.8 points-per-game - leading the squad in scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is responsible for 16 of the squad’s 36 three-pointers this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, the 20 points against Prep was McMahon’s scholastic career high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Versatile Carmelo Thompson is second on the team in scoring, posting 8.4 ppg while shooter Joey Pikiell (6.6 ppg) is second on the squad in three-pointers made with six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quincy Lawson, usually the first big man off the pine, is averaging just under six points a game (5.8 ppg), Jaysun Dominguez (5.4 ppg) is making excellent contributions from the point guard position while big Harry Ross (5.2 ppg) has an offensive game that’s ever-improving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reserve Nate Ortiz (4.6 ppg) is certainly a jack of all trades player, showing tremendous shooting ability and the knack for making the big play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And reserve guards Cody Roy (2.6 ppg) and Gavin Chamberlin (2.4 ppg) apply plenty of on-court pressure in Central’s defensive schemes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those athletes have all five games to date as Barrette is successfully using a nine-man unit in his rotation.</p>
