<p>PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Over an eventful freshman campaign, Ciara Collins did a tremendous job as a first-year player for the women’s basketball program at Pace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the month of February, the talented Collins earned a little postseason adulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The talented freshman was named to the Northeast-10’s 2022-23 All-Rookie Team this past Monday, playing extremely well for the Setters from start to finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins, seeing time at both guard and forward at Pace, played in 29 of the squad’s 30 games - earning 24 starts along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She kicked in 7.4 points and 3.4 rebounds in 25.5 minutes-per-game - putting her in the same breath as all the other freshmen who suited up in the NE10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 7.4 ppg was the fifth highest scoring average by a freshman in league play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Collins was fourth on the team in scoring and rebounding but where she truly excelled at Pace - and everywhere else for that matter - was at the free throw line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins missed just five charity tosses all season long, burying those open shots at an 86.8 percent clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with those scoring and rebounding totals, she also averaged 1.2 assists-per-game while scooping up 20 steals and rejecting 10 shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins had a tremendous game back on December 13 when the Setters picked off Felician by a 62-54 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sharpshooter cashed in on 7-of-15 shots from the field, connected on a three-pointer and canned both her free throw attempts for 17 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also nabbed five rebounds over the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Southern New Hampshire University on January 28, Collins just missed out on a double-double (12 points, nine rebounds) while in her last game against Bentley, she scored 11 points and grabbed two rebounds in a tough 57-52 loss in Waltham, Massachusetts during a NE10 Semifinal showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pace went 14-16 overall and 9-11 in NE10 play this year as Collins did extremely well over her first collegiate campaign.</p>
