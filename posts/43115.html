<p>Fundraising for the POW/MIA monument that will be unveiled on Memorial Day will continue right through May to ensure that all costs will be covered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We need more funds to make sure there aren't any overruns and make sure everything is covered," said American Legion Post 209 commander Brian Avery and vice chair of the Bristol Veterans Council, the latter of which is behind the monument effort. "We are encouraging donations."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The monument as proposed is unpolished gray granite, 6 feet tall, 10 inches thick and 3 feet wide on a 5-foot wide, 1 to 4 inch deep and 10-inch-tall base. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This is a one of kind monument that Bristol will be proud of, absolutely beautiful, and something that should make all veterans proud, not only to have Memorial Boulevard but to have the monument there," said Avery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While check donations can always be made directly to Bristol Veterans Council, Inc, P.O.W./M.I.A. Fundraiser c/o Stanley J. Piotrowski, Treasurer, P.O. Box 2634, Bristol, CT 06011-2634, Avery is also excited about a new effort.</p>

<p>Supporters can purchase merchandize -- t-shirts, hats and hoodies -- from area businesses to help raise funds. The merchandize is available from Family Roots Produce Market on Riverside Avenue and City True Value Hardware and Rental on Farmington Avenue, as well as Primo Press, also on Riverside Avenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"One hundred percent of the purchases goes toward the monument, minus the costs of production," Avery said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The items include POW Hoodies, POW Trucker Hats and POW t-shirts, from $25 to $60 depending on the item.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our goal is to have everything completed by Memorial Day," Avery said. "We still need to march strong to the finish line because we don't know about unexpected bills that might come up."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Go see Joe at True Value and April at Family Roots," Avery said. "They have the items in stock right now."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The items may also be purchased online at <a href="https://primo-press.printavo.com/merch/pow-monument-fundraiser/">https://primo-press.printavo.com/merch/pow-monument-fundraiser/</a>.</p>

<p>The fundraising goal of $20,000 has increased from $12,000 as originally reported. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
