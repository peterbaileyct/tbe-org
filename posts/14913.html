<p>BRISTOL – Dylan Woodsome did it again for the Bristol Senior American Legion Team on Tuesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta needed a starter for his depleted squad, Woodsome’s name was called and the chucker earned his second win of the campaign – helping to defeat Simsbury by an 8-4 push in a Zone 1 bout from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory moved Bristol to 10-6 in Zone 1 action as the program ended the regular season at 10-7 overall with the playoffs on deck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome (2-0) allowed out just a handful of hits, going 5.2 innings over a slick 78-pitch outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He walked just one, yielded five hits, and never gave Post 84 much to work with – dealing from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s been tough as nails for us all year,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Woodsome. “Today, he proved that pitching isn’t all about velocity. It’s about off-speed, keeping people off-balanced, popping up, getting out in front.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both team’s tallied eight total hits but each one by Bristol seemed to be bigger than the last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took Simsbury several innings before finally scoring a run against Woodsome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By that time, the visiting aggression was already in a deep hole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury’s Nolan Conderino (2-for-4) eked out a two-out base hit to left off Woodsome to open the affair but was stranded at second to end the half-inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris (2-for-3, three runs, RBI, six stolen bases), on the flip side, earned a leadoff walk and quickly stole second and third as Post 2 was looking to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron (1-for-2, walk, sac fly, two RBI) also drew a walk, putting runners on the corners, and with two away, Simsbury was in a pickle - the ‘Bristol pickle’ that is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breaking towards second, Caron baited a throw from behind the plate, and Post 2 went for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Caron danced a bit between first and second, Norris stole his third base of the evening – nabbing&nbsp;home plate with relative ease – as Bristol surged in front, 1-0, through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When he gets on base, we’re totally different team,” said LaPenta of Norris. “He just makes everything happen for us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two gone in the top of the second, Simsbury’s Peter Siana (2-for-2, two runs) belted a triple to deep left field but Ryan Maglio snared a Chris Paolella line drive at second base to end the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol got back to work in the bottom of the second as Tyler Martin lofted a ball over the Simsbury shortstop but overran the second base bag on a steal attempt and was tagged out on the play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome then drew a one out walk, moved to second on a passed ball, stole third along the way but never made it home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Bristol was at it again one inning later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris opened the Bristol portion of the third with an infield hit to short and Jayden Churchill zipped a single into left to put two on with no outs on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A double steal saw each runner advance a base and when the ball was thrown away at third, Norris trotted home to score a run and off a slick RBI double to left by Caron, Post 2 etched up a 3-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adam had some nice at-bats today,” said LaPenta of Caron. “He drove in a couple runs, had a sacrifice fly and a nice double.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette added an infield hit to put runners on first and third and with one out, a wild pitch scored Caron as Bristol snapped up a 4-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome ended the top of the fourth with his first strikeout of the game as he retired seven of his last eight batters to that point of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio opened the bottom portion of the fourth with a walk and Chris Osuch laid down a perfect sac bunt to advance the lead runner into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Norris sent Maglio home off his flare to right, propelling Bristol to a 5-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris then stole his fifth base of the game but ended up stranded as Simsbury trailed by five going into the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury poked out a couple singles in the fifth and on a double steal, Siana scored as the visitors cracked the scoreboard but still trailed, 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin drew a two-out walk in the bottom of the fifth and then Woodsome crushed a ball to the gap in right to score Martin, circling around to avoid getting tagged at the dish, as Post 2 scooped up a 6-1 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was pickle time once again as a double steal saw Alex Canzellarini, pinch running for Woodsome, scoot home – making it a 7-1 contest through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome left the game with two gone in the sixth as Mike Roalf replaced the starter on mound with a couple runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury’s Chris Paolella unleashed a double to right – just out of reach of a diving Matt Beaucar – as two scored to make it a 7-3 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paolella later tagged the dish on a fielding error to trim the deficit to 7-4 midway through the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris reached in the sixth inning via an error, moving on to second base, and when he swiped third, the theft was his sixth steal of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later scored on a Caron sacrifice to left as Post 2 zipped up an 8-4 lead going into the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just kept adding runs on,” said LaPenta. “Just to get that run back to make it 8-4, four runs is a lot better than three. With a four run lead, you have to get a lot more guys to the plate and I thought Mike [Roalf] did a nice job coming in and relieving.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury couldn’t generate any additional offense to end the contest as a Roalf strikeout propelled Bristol to the four run victory.</p>
