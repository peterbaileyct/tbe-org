<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse program is on a hot streak as of late and in a huge road confrontation against Wethersfield on Friday, the Lancers earned another big win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern lacrosse program has made it five straight as the Eagles fell by a 11-9 final in a CCC South battle from Wethersfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an 0-2 start to the year, it has been all Eastern as the Kingstreeters notched their third straight contest of 11-plus goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, Vanessa Drury led the offensive charge for Eastern – belting the Eagles for four goals while also dishing off a couple of assists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens flipped those numbers in reverse, adding two goals and four assists to the till.&nbsp;Sarah Hartley scooped up two goals and an assist while Kenzie Aparo, Lili Lowe and Kate Patterson all added a goal to complete Eastern’s scoring exploits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late game penalties by Wethersfield helped keep the home team busy as Eastern had a man advantage over the final six minutes of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three yellow cards led to doom and demise for the Eagles over that final stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, all the usual suspects helped frustrate the Wethersfield offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayna Hatcher and Carolyn Wilson kept pesky offenders away from the Eastern goal as keeper Avery Ellis was excellent between the pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another team effort led to another big victory for the Eastern program, now 5-1 after that distant 0-2 start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who’s Next?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the big one on Tuesday evening as Eastern locks horns with crosstown rival Bristol Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is set for 7 p.m., under the lights, from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
