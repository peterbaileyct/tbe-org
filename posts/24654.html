<p>Emma Stavens is once again hitting the field for the girls lacrosse program at Bristol Eastern, scoring goals left and right for the squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the junior competitor is now the program’s all-time leading scorer. The Lancers battled the coop program from Middletown/Coginchaug on Tuesday afternoon and Stavens notched over half the goals for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern ended up falling by a 12-11 decision as Stavens tallied six goals to lead the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the process, she established a new career goal record for the Eastern program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens now has 105 career goals which is two over the old standard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current Pace Women’s Basketball standout Ciara Collins held the number one spot after last season. She has 103 career goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tough loss for the Lancers who were playing with a man advantage late but could not get that game-tying score to fall in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back at it today at 4 p.m. against Lewis Mills from Burlington High School.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Eastern softball falls to Berlin but Emily Valentine goes yard on Wednesday</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers softball program fell at home to Berlin on opening day by a 15-2 final in six innings from the softball field over on King Street.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first contest for both squads.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Emily Valentine needed just one at-bat to blast a home run out of the park as she drilled a ball over the fence in center to give Eastern a bit of a lift.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, it’s one of many round-trippers for the talented Valentine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were home today against CCC interdivisional power Simsbury at 4 p.m. from the softball field at BEHS. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
