<p>Dick was a Korean War era Army Veteran. He earned his Bachelor Degree from Bryant College, and his Master’s Degree and additional graduate work at Boston University.

<p>Before and during his long retirement, Dick enjoyed many happy hours as an amateur radio operator, and as a member of local radio and computer clubs. He was a member and regular attendee of the First Congregational Church of Bristol. He was a lifelong Red Sox fan who proudly knew where he was when the curse was lifted. Daytime was spent at home with Dory where they together kept a beautiful home and yard surrounded by wonderful neighbors.</p>

<p>Most nights, Dick went out for coffee and conversation with friends, while noontime Saturday was set aside for pizza-time with family and friends. His pool was the place to be for the grandkids in the summertime -- where ice cream was a guarantee. He loved his naps but would wake for anyone, and if you asked him how he was he would surely respond “I can’t complain -- it doesn’t do any good.” Though he lived a long and happy life, Dick will surely be missed by all who knew and loved him.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
