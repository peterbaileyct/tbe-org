<h3>They said it</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sept. 1, 1967, candidate for City Treasurer and former city councilman Arthur I. Farrar, in reference to downtown redevelopment</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As to progress on redevelopment, one has only to remember that groundbreaking was over two years ago. It is probably the slowest construction since the pyramids. Like a horse that finishes last, you know it will finish, but no one knows when.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jan. 10, 1971, Councilman Frank Longo lashed out at the city council who refused to discuss the issue of an outside contractor hired by the city that had been plowing snow on private property</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kid councilor (Robert Fiondella) who thinks he is all great on parliamentary procedure, and a crackerjack. He is in my opinion a stale donut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He and his double (Councilman Donald Cassin) lack the common courtesy to even second a mere motion so we can have some discussion on the matter. That entire crew doesn’t have the tools nor will they ever find the means to put an end to things that I bring to light.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
