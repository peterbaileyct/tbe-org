<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All except one public participant during the public hearing Tuesday evening about allowing possession and consumption of alcohol at The Rockwell Theater during non-school events spoke in favor of the exemption to the current ordinance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the public hearing, members of the ordinance committee at their regular meeting voted unanimously to send the ordinance to the city council for a vote but not without reservations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the committee voted to revise an ordinance on cannabis establishments by including two words to clarify what has been a fuzzy area in the provision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When you talk about an overall experience. where bigger type acts want to come here," said Mikey Goldwasser, "they look to see what does the venue look like, what does the venue offer, and part of that is concessions and drinks and alcohol at some point. Again, it is this overall experience."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goldwasser, a member of the Economic and Community Development Commission since 2005, chair of the ECD Downtown Committee, as well as a member of the All-Heart marketing task force and the ARP task force, was one of a dozen people who spoke before the Ordinance Committee in favor of an exception that would allow the possession and consumption of alcohol at the Rockwell Theater at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We will draw more people in terms of people who want to participate in the theater, so bigger acts better acts, more folks, and I think it would be very positive," Goldwasser said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among those speaking for allowing alcohol on the premises at The Rockwell Theater were members of the task force originally charged with bringing the theater back as a destination, performers, a former mayor and former council member.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It continues a lot of the work that has already been done and it helps us make this a more competitive offering for those acts that would want to come to Bristol," Goldwasser said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was careful to distinguish between school-sponsored events and those sponsored by the City Arts and Culture Committee. In an agreement between the Bristol Board of Education and the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services, which oversees the Arts and Culture Commission, the two share an event calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A theme among their presentations was that the sale of alcohol would increase the ability of the current parttime arts and culture supervisor to attract better acts, attract a broader audience, bring more business downtown, possibly provide a salary for a fulltime supervisor and properly orient the city as the prime decisionmaker over the board of education when it comes to shows. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deb Schur, director of the annual Holiday Showcase of Stars and a member of the original task force charged with deciding if the theater was a viable theater in the first place, recounted events early on where the city opened the theater and sponsored several shows that included serving alcohol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were all successes, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This theater is a gift to the people of this town and to the current administration," Schur said. "It is very important that we do not blow this opportunity."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As someone who works with theater, who works with a lot of theater people, bigger important acts that would love to perform at that venue will turn away if alcohol isn't served. It's just a fact of life."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walter Lewandoski, chair of the arts and culture commission reiterated the impact of having alcohol on premises since it will enhance the bottom line, but he also reported that of the events that the commission has sponsored the question of alcohol comes up repeatedly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The hundreds of people I have spoken to over the course of those events the question comes up about the beverages," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The more people we bring in from outside of Bristol is going to put dollars in our pockets, support restaurants and bars and other attractions in the city, which is what our goal is, to grow that theater into a destination and the district as well."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arianna Therriault, Arts and Culture Supervisor, a parttime position with BPRYCS, said, there is a clear need for allowing alcohol at the Rockwell Theater not only because it would allow the commission to bring in higher quality shows but also because alcohol sales would help keep ticket prices down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the moment, with ticket sales at around $40, filling 610 seats brings in $24,640 dollars, she said. That leaves the city with around $6,400 after expenses. Adding $4.50 a person for the purchase of a beverage would leave the city with $9,145 and over 12 shows, that would amount to $32,940, which might be used to hire more staff or even pay for her job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Salice, a popular performer in many shows, including the Holiday Showcase of Stars, said that her taking the time to attend the hearing shows how important the issue is.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Speaking as a performer and patron, I am strongly in favor of this," she said, adding that she has friends across the state, who, when the subject comes up, ask, "What do you mean you aren't going to sell alcohol?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She reiterated the point about attracting better shows and greater talent, since that is a factor for whether talent will come to a theater in the first place. In addition, she said, that the theater will draw more business downtown. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think I am pretty reflective of people who go to a show," she said. "If I am inclined to have a glass of wine or drink at the theater.  I am not disinclined to not then go and have a drink or a night cap or a bite to eat with my friends after a show at a local restaurant," she said, drawing laughter from the audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former mayor and chair of the original task force charged with determining the future of the theater, Ellen Zoppo-Sassu provided some history of the theater, including the first forays that involved whether the former Memorial Boulevard School would be an arts and culture center before its current incarnation as a magnet school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former school and theater became a rallying point for the city, she said, referring to the first shows where the members of the community, from ages 8 to 88, showed up to clean the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a model for the current arrangement between the Board of Education and the City Arts and Culture Commission, she pointed to the one between The Palace which sits adjacent to The Waterbury Performing and Visual Arts Magnet School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She complimented the Board of Education for a phenomenal job with its curriculum and staff, calling BAIMS a gem, but at the same time, drew a distinction between the school and the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I don't necessarily think that they need to be the caretakers of the asset that sits on the other side of the wall," she said. "And that it is the theater. Because it shares a wall doesn't make it a school, it is still a theater."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Directing her comments to the members of the Ordinance Committee and by extension to the City Council, she said, the large investment of over $25 million, "makes you the stakeholders who have a decision to make about whether this is something that is going to be successful or whether it is going to be a continuation that Bristol doesn't deserve nice things."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another member of the original task force and current member of the City Arts and Culture Commission, Andrea Adams, recalled the city's reluctance to provide alcohol to several Pop-Up Piazza events, when the city was involved with its Renaissance Downtown discussions. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both pop-up events, which did end up selling alcohol, were huge successes, she said. And that then led to future successes when the Exchange Club took over the management of the Mum Festival and allowed alcoholic beverages to be incorporated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former council member Dave Mills said, "How many times do we have to come to meetings to present to the city council or anyone in charge about opportunity. Bristol deserves to have this theater at the best possible marketing point. You need to have all the tools involved." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those tools include a great venue, great acts and beverages and snacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"That's what we'd like to have so let's not blow the opportunity," he said. "That's critical that we vote in favor of having this. Let's have all the tools in our toolbox so we can attract the acts we want to attract, the people we want to, and build the businesses downtown."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ordinance Committee member Cheryl Thibeault read from emails, including those from BPRYCS Superintendent Josh Medeiros and Bristol Board of Education chair Danta Tagariello, who were both in favor of the exception allowing sale and consumption of alcohol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medeiros referred to the economic realities, including the significant issue of economics around the theater as well as providing a salary for the arts and culture supervisor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tagariello said that he would continue to work with BPRYCS on how to share and utilize the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, among those speaking in favor of the exception were the city 's Marketing and Public Relations Specialist Dawn Nielsen and local property owner and member of the Fair Rent Commission David Haberfeld. Former member of the Memorial Boulevard Task Force Kim Villanti sent an email in favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One negative comment was received from a resident on Eugene Avenue and was read by Thibeault into the record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the committee meeting that followed, the members voted unanimously to send the ordinance for a vote to the council at its next meeting, next Tuesday. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I do have my own thoughts or misgivings about having alcohol whether it's divided by a wall or not," said Ordinance Committee chair Sebastian Panioto, referring to the proximity of the school to the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think it warrants further discussion and analysis from the board of education," he added, conceding that it would be harsh to vote against forwarding the exception to the council for a vote since there was so much support behind it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He concluded that the issue had been around too long and that the outpouring of support was positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ordinance Committee member Jacqueline Olson opened her comments by thanking all those who saved the school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Having been a graduate of it, I would have been devastated if that school had been torn down," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for the exception, she said she did not have a preference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I personally don't feel I need alcohol to enjoy a theater performance," she said. "It kind of doesn't matter to me whether we approve it or not, but I am leaning toward approving it considering the overwhelming people that want to have the alcoholic beverages."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her comments, Thibeault said that "the overwhelming desire of the community was spoken today."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thibeault was a member of the original task force and volunteers at theater events. She said from the beginning the theater was always going to be a theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The fact that it shares a wall with school should not diminish that," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a volunteer, she often has heard people saying that they would like to have a beverage, either wine or beer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I am not going to be deterred," she said, "and I think we need to forward this to council and see this come to fruition."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She pointed out that the City Arts and Culture Commission received only $15,000 a year, part of which goes to marketing. The commission could do much more with the added revenue, including hiring the supervisor full-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regarding the cannabis establishment revision, the change was to clarify language because the original language left out a specific process for applicants to follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tom Conlin, Corporation Counsel attorney, said this situation might open the door to legal action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When the council was going through this," he said, "the public hearing process, we all understood that licenses meant every single approval that would be required by the state. We got that a number of times, so we felt that by adding those two words it would cover that."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The amendment did not address a request from a recent petitioner who intended to move from Hartford, where it is already established to Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You aren't changing anything in response to that vendor's particular concerns," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both revisions will be on the agenda at the next city council meeting on next Tuesday, Jan. 9.</p>
