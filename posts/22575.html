<p>He was raised in East Berlin where he was active in scouting and attained the Eagle Scout rank. He served in the United States Marine Corps then worked for two decades running the family business, Cannon Caterers.&nbsp;He became a Friend of Bill W. and realized he could help others by going to Tunxis Community College where he received a degree in drug and alcohol counseling.&nbsp;He worked as a counselor for Community Partners in Action in Hartford and others before retiring, making a significant impact across our community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having to keep busy in retirement, he drove limousines and busses and could be found scrapping junk metal throughout the community.&nbsp;He was a Yankees and Giants fan, an avid cyclist, outdoorsman, world traveler and was a recent member of Asbury United Methodist Church, Forestville. On Feb. 21 he would have celebrated 49 years of sobriety and would have done so with a smile and a story.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
