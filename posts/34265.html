<p>Saturday night, the 620-seat Rockwell Theatre debuted, and it was a success by all accounts, even with the power outage. This will be a prelude of things, with more memorable evenings in the months and years to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The theatre has been described as a jewel and the gateway to downtown. You will get no disagreement here, but it was almost not to be, however.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The land was donated by Albert Rockwell to the city in 1920, and the school followed in 1921. By 2012, it had worn out its usefulness and was closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A robust debate then ensued regarding its future. Thankfully, the art magnet school (BAIMS) and theatre won out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would have been devastating if the building had become city hall or a stale high-end condominium complex where only an elite few benefits from the building and its 7.4 acres.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Insert Blah blah blah blah)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albert Rockwellâ€™s generosity from over 100 years ago is the gift that keeps on giving.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
