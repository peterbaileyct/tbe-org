<p>The City of Bristol Economic &amp; Community Development Department in partnership with MazzMedia have announced that they have been awarded a 2021 Silver Telly Award in the General – Promotional Video category for the “Made in Bristol” video series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The videos were produced in the spring and summer of 2020 and released in the fall to promote several successful small businesses located in the City of Bristol. The videos were intended to encourage others who may have an idea about opening a small business in the City to do so, as well as to highlight the great places Bristol has to visit, instilling a sense of pride for those who live and work in the All Heart City.</p>

<p>“Interviews with the business owners were the foundation of the videos,” stated Producer Tony Mazzarella. “We were able to capture the genuine emotion and passion each of the owners has for their business. Their enthusiasm and respect for the city of Bristol was authentic. In the end,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;emotion and authenticity that makes a video engaging.”&nbsp;</p>

We thank all the businesses that have taken part and look forward to creating new videos in the future.”</p>
