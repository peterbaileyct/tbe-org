<p>Nancy M. (Pouliot) Proulx, 91, of Bristol, widow of Eugene L. Proulx, passed away peacefully on Friday, June 9, at Ingraham Manor. Nancy was born on May 19, 1932, in Bristol and was a daughter of the late Leo and Blanche Pouliot. </p>

<p>She was a lifelong Bristol resident where she raised her family. She retired from Bradlees Department Store at the age of 60, spending her retirement years caring for her grandchildren. Nancy was an avid cook and baker and enjoyed going to the movies, playing cards and bingo, visiting wineries, and going to Ogunquit, Maine, her favorite place by the sea. Her most treasured memories were yearly family vacations at the beach. She was a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, and loved her family beyond measure. Spending time with her family was most important to her and is what truly made her heart happy. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
