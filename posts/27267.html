<p>OLD LYME - The CIAC State Open Golf Championship came and went on Saturday, featuring a few golfers from the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the duo of Bristol Central’s Scott Petrosky and St. Paul Catholic’s Matthew Downes each made tremendous finishes over a loaded boys field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match, contested from Black Hall Country Club in Old Lyme, saw the state’s best talent on the green with Petrosky and Downes in the mix throughout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the completion of the afternoon, Petrosky and Downes were each within five strokes of the final leader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ellington’s Bradley Sawka won the Open event by carding a 71 while Jack Wise of Cromwell (72) was the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connor Rabbitt (RHAM, 73) came in third place, Can Seiffert (Killingly, 74) and Luke Stennett (74) tied for fourth and soon after, Petrosky’s score came popping in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky shot just four-over par, carding a 75, along with Shane Luca of East Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in eighth place, Downes nabbed a 76 - as did RHAM’s Holden Sullivan - to complete the leaderboard for the locals at five-over that day.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the girls portion of the Open, St. Paul Catholic’s Olivia Dahn also shot well, earning a tenth-place tie by carding a 90.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin’s Libby Dunne and Lewis Mills’s Claudia Villalon also hit for a 90 as the greens were pretty good to Dahn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Waterbury Coop dominated the event as the duo of Laniah Moffett and Aoife Devaney went 1-2 for the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moffett earned medalist honors with a slick score of 75 while Daveney carded an 80 for second place.</p>
