<p>An afternoon filled with expression and conversation are coming to the Bristol Bazaar on Saturday for the All-Heart Art Exhibition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The community event, organized by Bristol Board of Education Commissioner Maria Pirro Simmons, will feature original works from artists who are passionate about the All-Heart City.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bristol is called the All Heart City, and the artists are answering the question; ‘What does living in an All-Heart community look like to you?'" Simmons said. "It's going to be really exciting to see the varying perspectives of what that looks like in our diverse community.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have some amazing featured artists,” Simmons added. “Some students and adult members of the community who are showcasing their art to the community. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artists will be presenting their works in an array of artistic mediums including, visual art, written expression, song, spoken word.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Art is such a beautiful expression, it’s such a unique way of conveying a message,” said Simmons. “To me, when I hear beautiful piece of music, or I when I look at a beautiful piece of art, it stays with me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's almost like it becomes embedded into my mind. So many people want to be able to express themselves, and I just thought that this might be a unique way of doing it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event will be held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Bristol Bazaar; an indoor marketplace that promotes the work of local artists and craftsman. Simmons stated that she has invited bipartisan city leadership to attend the art exhibition along with all community members. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It felt like an opportunity to come together and share space in the spirit of community partnership,” Simmons said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Toward that end, she said she has invited the mayor and current city council members, along with those who are running for election to the city council, all the Board of Education commissioners, the superintendent of schools as well as Miss Mum, Madison LaMarre.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I want us to share the same space and put all the differences aside,” Simmons added. “Put all the judgments aside and just seek to understand one another with patience and care.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the municipal elections less than a month away, Simmons said she feels that it’s important for city leaders from all political parties to put aside their differences and engage in a positive way. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m hoping that it will be a convergence of people who want to live in an inclusive community, said Simmons, “that we can embrace misunderstandings with opportunities to understand one another.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Being a leader means being more than what we identify as,” Simmons continued. “Before we are Republican or Democrat, before we are Board of Ed commissioners, mayor and councilors, we are people first.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
