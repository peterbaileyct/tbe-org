<p>The ethics complaint against the sitting Board of Education chair were dismissed at an involved and standing room only hearing last Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quote from Shelby</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The complaint was dismissed, as expected, because it was without merit or evidence," Shelby Pons said in a statement following the hearing which brought claims of xxx against her. "This defamatory attack was intended to harm my family, my character, and my professional reputation."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pons has been chair of the Bristol Board of Education for the past xxx. A Democrat, she was elected by the board which is majority Republican, after the former chair resigned from the position but not the board for family reasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Those responsible acted recklessly," Pons said, "without consideration for the lasting consequences their actions would impose on my family and our school community."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ethics complaints was brought before the Ethics Commission (when xxx) where it was advanced to the hearing state, with (what is the phrase?).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The complaint cited Pons for x, y and z.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pons thanked the ethics board and the members who voted to dismiss the complaint which she deemed "baseless claims" that were "politically motivated."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It is deeply concerning that political agitators and the ethics board were used as tools to retaliate against me for fulfilling my responsibilities as board chair."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, she thanked board of education members who share her commitment to the 8,000 students in the Bristol Public School system, along with their families and hard-working staff. She said she remained committed to transparency and accountability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a brief statement, the complainant Lauren Vernaglia, said throughout the hearing before the ethics board that she was acting in good faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I followed the steps outlined by the city to hold an elected official accountable for possible unethical behavior but was grossly misled by an inexperienced City Ethics Board," she wrote in an email following the hearing.  I was berated and interrogated by an expensive attorney paid for by taxpayer dollars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Meanwhile, the elected official admitted to distributing unredacted documents containing student and parent information that she was not entitled to do and faced no consequences because she simply apologized," she concluded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the hearing Pons testified that she did share unredacted documents, unwittingly, since she was acting on advice by an attorney. Several names that would have been redacted prior to sharing material were included...</p>

<p>Quote from Joan</p>

<p>"Dave, While I would never presume to speak for other board members, I share my own thoughts. We were tasked with answering to certain issues formally brought to our attention. None of us on the board are attorneys, but all are Bristol citizens of varied backgrounds, which makes any municipal Board stronger. We gathered and based upon information provided to us, we had questions and could not simply answer as to 3 proposed ethics violations based on what we initially received. This prompted the next step which was the meeting where you were also present. I take the matter of ethics violations very seriously. At this meeting, both side were able to speak. We made attempts to gather sufficient evidence to allow us to answer to the claims presented. After hearing approximately 2 hours of testimony, a motion was made by one of the board members to dismiss and was voted on, 4-1 in favor of dismissal. 4 votes is the minimum to move a motion. Additionally, we originally attempted to schedule this meeting another day (or two) but there were conflicts. I had no idea that the day chosen was the same day as the Board of Education meeting. Had I known, I certainly would have suggested another day. While perhaps the person filing the complaint felt she "lost", I believe she was heard loud and clear."</p>

<p>Go back to the complaints ... Mooney, what's his title?</p>

<p>Raised the dismissal, voted down ...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the hearing, both Pons and Vernaglia were sworn in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pons conceded that she should have redacted the names of parents and said that wouldn't happen again.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meeting on the third floor of city hall in what had been scheduled in one meeting, the ethics board elected to open a partition to create more room for attendees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the meeting, members of the audience included a group of Republican Board of Education members who stayed for the proceedings, missing a BOE meeting. They mostly remained silent and took notes during the meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Democratic members of the BoE left for the meeting, but still did not constitute a quorum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, during the meeting, members of the audience responded, sometimes loudly, to statements from Vernaglia. At one moment, when Vernaglia mentioned the name of the person who divulged information about the alleged misappropriation of funding, there was a collective gasp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Vernaglia later in the hearing stopped the proceedings to correct herself, divulging that the person who shared the information was not the person she mentioned but another person, the crowd peppered the meeting room with exclamations, characterizing the shift as perjurious.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Simons (sp) statement read at the BoE meeting:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Service is the rent you pay for room on this earth.” Service. Some serve quietly. Some serve publicly. Some serve publicly with a fervent ability to see broken systems. Some serve publicly with a fervent ability to see broken systems and are brave enough to fix them. They remain brave enough to fix broken systems even when faced with relentless opposition. These are the public servants I want serving my community and my children. For these public servants, service often comes at a great cost. These are the leaders that show up, stand up, and speak up. Their voices are the catalyst for change. I have heard some of the amazing educators in Bristol Public Schools tell our students they can do hard things; they can be brave. We tell our children to be brave, to stand up for what is just and right. We encourage them to be the voice for those who are unable to use theirs. If you see something, say something, right? But are we a community that truly believes and values this? What happens to those public servants who do the brave, hard thing? What happens to those who stand up for what they believe is just and right, deeply rooted in values and fervently seeking to fix broken systems?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can tell you what happens to those public servants from my experience on this Board. They speak a truth that makes people uncomfortable. They walk into a room and people get quiet. They leave the room and people begin talking…. About them. They are villainized. They become targets. I have had a taste of this in my role as Board Commissioner. In the beginning, I was valued when I showed up. I was even valued when I stood up. But things changed when I spoke up. It was when I spoke up that people wanted me to shut up. So, I am speaking up again tonight even if it means I’m likely to be the next target. But, I can be brave, and I can do hard things. My dad was vehemently against me running for the Board of Education. He said it was political and politics was ugly. He was trying to protect me. As parents we hope that just once our children tell us we were right. Well, my dad was right. I have been in education for nearly 3 decades and I have rarely met anyone as fierce an advocate as our Board of Education Chair Shelby Pons. She shows up. She stands up, and she speaks up, unapologetically. And that makes so many people fantastically uncomfortable. Shelby stands up for equity and fights against injustice. She isn’t afraid to ask the really hard questions and have the really hard conversations. She is one of the bravest people I know. I can say this with confidence because I have seen her up close and personal. She is deeply committed to children and families. She works tirelessly to serve this community with honor and integrity. But she does not do that quietly. She is unbossed and unbought and that has made her a target. Shelby is sorry that she cannot be here tonight. She is defending herself against baseless and fallacious claims aimed at silencing her and tarnishing her reputation. Unfortunately, this is the price she has had to pay to serve this community with passion and purpose. I want to personally thank the commissioners at this table who showed up tonight to do the work of the Board. I know there were competing priorities tonight, but our work as commissioners must be upheld. Unfortunately, we do not have enough commissioners present tonight to vote on action items. I apologize to those community members who were relying on our vote tonight. All votes intended for tonight will need to be tabled. If Bristol wants to attract Board Commissioners who will be strong and courageous advocates for the children and families of this community, then each of us must be brave and do hard things. We must be comfortable with being uncomfortable. This District will not grow otherwise. As a lifelong resident of Bristol, as an educator and a mother of two children in Bristol Public Schools, I want leaders who will show up, speak up, and stand up, unapologetically. Anything less is not acceptable to me, and it shouldn’t be acceptable to you either.</p>

<p>DTC statement --</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Statement from the Bristol Democratic Town Committee regarding the recent Complaint Filed with the Bristol Board of Ethics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Board of Ethics was recently called into session to hear a complaint against the Board of Education Chairperson Shelby Pons. The complaint alleged violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Family Educational Rights &amp; Privacy Act (FERPA) violations, and alleged misappropriation of BOE funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After almost three hours of discussing FOIA and FERPA rules, over which the Bristol Ethics Board has no authority nor expertise to rule on and a hearsay-based claim of misappropriation of funds which was fully disproven, the Board dismissed the claim in a 4 to 1 vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This never should have gotten this far. Allegedly, “probable cause” was found at the Board’s initial October 4<sup>th</sup> meeting, thus triggering the Board’s action. As correctly noted by Ms. Pons’ attorney, the review of FOIA and FERPA violations is not under the Board’s jurisdiction so there is no probable cause there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As to the misappropriation of funds claim, the citizen who made the complaint provided no evidence but stated that “somebody told her.” That is a ridiculously low bar that should have been rejected outright.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With regards to the true intent of this complaint, that reality cracked open for all to see when Ms. Pons’ attorney put into evidence emails between Ms. Vernaglia, the complainant, and some Republican BOE members clearly discussing why the current Board of Education Chair is not a Republican.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using the Board of Ethics as a political weapon should be of major concern to the community and even more importantly the Board of Ethics itself. These are volunteers who deserve our respect and support for taking on this task. In a real ethics situation, their job would be difficult at best. We should point out that the Acting Board Chair, Joan Cloutier, quickly realized that there was no substance to these claims and tried to move for dismissal. The motion passed but with 2 Board members absent, it lacked the necessary four votes garnering a vote of 3-2 and so the meeting continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City of Bristol has a responsibility to these board volunteers and to those accused that the volunteer board members fully understand what constitutes probable cause and what does not and should be rejected. We would encourage the Caggiano administration to get on with that education process immediately. As to the “probable cause” in this case, we will be asking for all documentation and discussion as to how they arrived at that determination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should also be noted that four Republican members of the Board of Education, Kristen Giantonio, Lori Osenkowski, Jennifer Van Gorder and Russ Anderson, failed in their duty to attend last night’s BOE meeting, opting instead to stay at the Ethics Board meeting. This dereliction of duty resulted in a lack of a quorum, so no action was taken on any of the agenda items. This blatant disregard of their duty to the over 8,000 students and hundreds of BOE staff proves the claims made were politically motivated. None of them testified and not one of them had a role in the hearing. They just sat there doing nothing while they had duty to attend the BOE meeting. These four made it abundantly clear that the good of our education system and our students is not their priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may very well be that the City’s Ethics code may have been violated by these 4 Republican BOE members. If just ONE of the four had attended the BOE meeting, a quorum would have been met and the meeting agenda could have been voted upon. An agenda that included 4 policies, approval of an Eagle Scout project which is now delayed a month, the approval of a donation of $20K for playground equipment at Mountain View School and the approval of a trip for BEHS students to visit France, in addition to other important agenda items.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was witnessed Wednesday night should never have happened. It was a travesty that wasted city resources. It put the Board of Ethics at risk, the complainant at risk, Ms. Pons at risk, and our education system at risk. Bristol residents deserve better.</p>
