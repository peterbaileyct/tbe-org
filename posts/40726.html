<p>Connecticut businesses have been the target of an&nbsp;ongoing potential government imposter scam, according to a release from Attorney General William Tong, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, Commissioner of Banking Jorge Perez, and Commissioner of Consumer Protection Bryan T. Cafferelli. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this scheme, a company called CT UCC Statement Service, attempts to get businesses to pay $90 for a copy of a Uniform Commercial Code report. While the solicitation is designed to look like a government notice, this company has no affiliation with the State of Connecticut. In fact, UCC reports may be accessed for free via the Secretary of the State’s website at <a href="http://business.ct.gov">business.ct.gov</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A UCC financing statement is a form documenting that a creditor, such as a bank, has a lien on a borrower’s personal property. These forms are filed with the Secretary of the State and provide proof of the assets subject to the lien to other creditors.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the company notes in small print that they are “not affiliated with any state or government agency” and that businesses are not required to use their services, such a disclaimer may not be sufficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This company has zero affiliation with the State of Connecticut and there is no need to pay for their useless services. If you receive this letter, do not respond. If you have paid any money to this business, please file a complaint with my office,”&nbsp;said Attorney General Tong.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
