<p>SIMSBURY – Ryan Fradette of Bristol’s Senior American Legion baseball team was due for a big hitting game sometime over the summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that contest came to pass on Tuesday night as Fradette smacked out two home runs to lead Post 2 to a 6-3 victory over Simsbury from Memorial Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a huge win for the Bristol program (6-4 Zone 1), stopping a two-game losing streak dead in its tracks, while Simsbury fell to 4-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette had a night as he went 2-of-4 from the dish, scooping up four of Bristol’s five RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His offense was badly needed because Post 84 snuck a couple runs across in the first inning, nabbing a quick 2-0 push against pitching stud Roberto Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Cruz was just about on the money the entire evening on Tuesday – one hitting Simsbury while striking out nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed three walks and two earned runs but with the Bristol offense dropping in ten hits, it was only a matter of time before Post 2 snared the lead for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz is now a sterling 4-0 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron heated up from the plate as he collected three hits while scoring a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill (2-of-3, run, RBI) made it on base a few times, getting plunked by the ball over one of his at-bats, while the grouping of Tyler Martin, Dylan Woodsome (stolen base) and Matt Beaucar all tallied hits for the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Osuch and Woodsome also generated walks to complete a busy night at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury’s Evan Odegard (3.2 IP, seven hits, 5 ER), who helped defeat Bristol the previous week, was tagged for the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nolan Conderino generated the only hit for Post 84 who simply did not have any answer for the crafty Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a couple passed balls, a wild pitch, and a few walks helped the home team hang around early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, once Bristol’s offense heated up, Simsbury fell behind midgame and never caught up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by two through two completed frames, Post 2 scooped up three runs in the top of the third tilt before Post 84 answered with one in the bottom of the inning to make it a 3-3 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Caron/Fradette duo sprang to life at the dish as Bristol scored two runs in the fourth and added one additional tally in the fifth to snare a three-run edge (6-3) as the home team simply couldn’t figure out Cruz on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz threw 92 total pitches over the winning effort while Elliott Norris played well in the field, leading the team with four assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>West Hartford has yet to draw a loss in 2022</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol gets it chance to be the first program to hang a loss on Zone 1 leader West Hartford (12-0) later this week as the teams battle for the third time on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 5:30 p.m. from Conard High School in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time the teams played, Post 2 dropped a tough 9-6 decision back on June 28 from the same venue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol scored six runs in the sixth to make a real game out of it, proving it can hang with the zone leader.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar is a candidate to start that game on the mound against West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 is 2-0 versus the squad from Bristol this season but the locals have two chances to tie the season series.</p>
