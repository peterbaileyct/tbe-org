<p>BRISTOL - It’s been quite some time since the Bristol Eastern boys basketball team has been on a hot streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Lancers are a sterling 5-1 with its 53-47 loss at home to Simsbury back in late December the only setback to date for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With victories over Bristol Central, Simsbury, Berlin and Wethersfield since the start of the winter break, the Kingstreeters have won four straight games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was last on a four-game winning streak back in early 2014-2015 and the 5-1 start is the best since the 2009-10 campaign - a year Eastern won 20 games and captured the CCC South championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current edition is finding ways to win close games and that’s the sign of an ever-improving program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Wethersfield last Thursday, the Lancers got to the pay window via a huge 56-46 come-from behind effort which included plenty of outstanding play from the Eastern bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naseem Walker played a critical roll off the bench to frustrate Wethersfield guards while Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum displayed his crafty jumper and rebounding that has been money for the reserve forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Donte DePass has seen spot minutes over the last few games, he always gives the best effort he can out on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When all hands are on deck, ready for their number to get called, the response has been not only productive but positive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bynum gave us some good minutes,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray of the Wethersfield triumph. “He makes that big shot. And Naseem comes in and even Donte, he came in and gave us a break when we needed it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s different people on different nights.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also against the Eagles, the Lancers were without reserve guard Jordan Chisholm for the second half - coming into the contest averaging 5.0 points and 2.0 assists over his last couple games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been a huge contributor as of late but his teammates came together to give the Kingstreets even more of a boost with Chisholm on the bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jordan was hurt tonight so we were down one guy,” said Ray. “That’s the mark of a good team and I told them ‘listen, if you’re not shooting the ball very well and you can still win games in other ways by digging in and playing defense or getting some loose balls, that’s very helpful."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those reserves have been tremendous in subbing for the starting unit of Nate Fries, Zaveyn Tate, Ben D’Amato, Lukas Sward and Brayden Dauphinais.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All five of those players have started every game and consistency counts in large amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have been winning games early and often this season but there will be some tough assignments ahead for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sandwiched between two games against Rocky Hill over an 11 day stretch, Platt comes to town on Thursday (6:45 p.m.) and then next Tuesday, the Lancers travel to Glastonbury for a CCC interdivisional showdown on January 17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contests against Rocky Hill commence this Monday on the road (6:45 p.m.) and on Friday, January 20 (6:45 p.m.) from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You know what's ahead of you,” said Ray of the upcoming slate of games. “The CCC’s got a lot of tough games, a lot of tough teams. Any time you can get a win, I’m getting excited. I’m getting excited for the kids. I’m getting excited the way they’re playing more than the result.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could Eastern be 6-0 this year if that third period effort again Simsbury went a different way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absolutely, but this group is playing well as a team, competes for each other and will absorb a loss or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s truly okay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After so many tough efforts over the last couple of seasons, all the hard working is beginning to pay off and the record proves that point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It sounds crazy. The wins are great but it’s the way they’re winning and how they’re coming together,” said Ray. “That’s important. I mean we’re going to be in for some tough nights I’m sure. But any time you can have something to draw back on, I can go back in that huddle and say ‘remember that game when this was happening and we came out on the winning end of it?’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sometimes in time outs, that’s all it is. It’s just reaffirming what they’re already done and how hard they’ve worked.”</p>
