<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Helping to anchor the downtown Bristol Centre Square development with professional jobs and accessible health care for the entire community, Wheeler Health is moving forward with a plan to purchase an approximately 1.3-acre lot between North Main and Hope Streets, with the intent to build an approximately 35,000-square foot community health center and administrative headquarters, opening in 2023. More than 200 full- and part-time employees will work at the new building, which will become Wheeler's flagship location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Services currently provided at Wheeler's two existing health centers in Bristol will move to this new building and include adult primary care, pediatrics, behavioral health and psychiatry, addiction treatment,nutrition, LGBTQIA-responsive services, and more, for all ages. Wheeler will continue to make ongoing referrals for specialty services like oncology and dental care to Bristol Health and other local providers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>INVESTING IN IMPACT, INVESTING IN BRISTOL<br>Wheeler will fund the entire project through a combination of loans, allocations from Wheelerâ€™s endowment, private giving, and public grants. To help support the construction of the center, Wheeler has also announced a four-year, $500,000 fundraising campaign. Led by a<br>committee of Wheeler Trustees with ties to the Bristol community, including Chairman Jim Moylan, the organization has raised nearly $280,000 in gifts and pledges toward the goal now at the public launch of the campaign, and expects to exceed its goals within four years.</p>
