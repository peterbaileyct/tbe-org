<h3>Random pop culture thought</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the movie <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, Luke Skywalker meets Yoda on Dagobah after he crash lands in a swamp. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does Dagobah have a historical society? If so, after Luke led the rebels to defeat the Empire, did the Dagobah Historical Society place a historic marker where Luke and Yoda first met? Or what about marker at Yoda’s hovel that says Luke Skywalker Slept Here.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free&nbsp;access.</em></p>
