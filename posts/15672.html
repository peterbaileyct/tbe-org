<p>The Bristol Greeners of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League start their 2022 playoff run with a single-elimination game against the Wallingford Cardinals on Sunday from Pat Wall Field in Wallingford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 5 p.m. with the victor of that showdown advancing to the double-elimination portion of the GHTBL playoff tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Play-In Game for the Greeners (5-19) could be a blessing in disguise as Bristol is a perfect 3-0 against the Wallingford squad over regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cardinals (6-18) finished one game better than the Greeners this season despite struggling to defeat the locals and earned the right to play the postseason game from home in Wallingford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol defeated Wallingford three times in July this year within a 15-day period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 6, the Greeners defeated the Cardinals by a 4-1 final as Bristol earned its second victory of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitching stud Kenny Knox went the distance on the mound that day, allowing just three hits while striking out 11 over a complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on July 15, in a home-and-home rematch against the Cardinals, Bristol won 6-5 over a close call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late game heroics sealed the deal for the Greeners as Casey Horjus came out of the bullpen to win the showdown against the Cardinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was tremendous over 2.2 innings, posting just one hit while fanning four to seize the victorious effort. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six days later on Thursday, July 21, Bristol was a huge 13-7 victor as the Greeners made it a sweep for the season against the Cardinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that last victory over Wallingford, Bristol scooped up 14 hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ivan Ramos (three runs scored, two RBI) and Jon Pierce (four RBI) led the charge with three hits apiece while Mike Munson, the former Plainville High School standout, went 2-for-3 with an RBI while striking out five over 1.2 innings on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Felix Gutierrez also tallied a couple hits while Trevor Mays, Keegan Bartis, and Bryan Capezzone all tallied hits for the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AJ Lorenzetti won the game from the hill, going 5.1 innings, allowing three earned runs and striking out three as the Bristol program was on a three-game winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will the fourth time be the charm for the Wallingford program against the Greeners?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Expos</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of the GHTBL Play-In Game will be slotted into the eighth seed in the 2022 Playoff Tournament bracket and square off against No. 1 seed Record Journal Expos on August 8 in a contest from Palmer Field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Expos were the top team in GHTBL play this year at 18-6 overall â€“ going 3-0 overall against the upstarts from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners were outscored over those three games, 33-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GHTBL playoff games commence from both Palmer Field and McKenna Field in East Hartford this year with the championship game commencing in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main bracket is a double-elimination format.</p>
