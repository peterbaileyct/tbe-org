<p>The Bristol Central girls lacrosse team continues to compete and win, even as the weather wasn’t so agreeable on Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were able to spin CCC South competitor Enfield by a 10-2 thrashing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, played in Enfield, saw the program from Bristol move to 5-1-1 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have won three straight contests and is averaging 10.3 goals-per-match since that 6-6 stalemate at Edwin O. Smith back on April 22.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central swept Enfield this season, winning 2-0, and the Rams have outscored the Eagles 25-5 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Lowe led the charge against Enfield with a hat trick while Rachel Wygant, Abby Duval and Kaylynn LaPointe all notched two goals apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maddie Secor also added a score to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, it was a near flawless performance - allowing just the two goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Alyah Rodriguez Warren once again led the charge and held her ground in the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The defense and Alyah were great all game long,” said Central coach Kyle Phelan via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If everything pans out with Central’s current schedule, the program will not leave Bristol for the rest of the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, the Rams are back in action, squaring off against Middletown in a CCC South bout from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Notes…</strong>The JV program won as well, squaring up a 9-4 victory…The JV squad is back to work on Wednesday, May 11 against Lewis Mills (6 p.m.)…Central’s varsity outfit defeated Lewis Mills last Wednesday by an 11-3 push…Secor led the charge with four goals, Lowe added three, and Ava Bouchard collected two for the winners.</p>
