<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>August was filled with new adventures and classic events. Now, it’s time for us to do BIG things in September. Get ready for a Galarian Summer with a new mechanic. More on that later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just a reminder, the next Community Day will take place on Saturday, Aug. 31, between 2 and 5 p.m. in each Trainer's local time zone. The headliner will be Popplio, the Sea Lion Pokémon from the Alolan region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mega Salamence- Aug. 21 to Sept. 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Locations</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Page Park, 651 King St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Galar Region is going to make a huge presence this season! During the GO Big event during the Max out season, more Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region featured in the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield games on Nintendo Switch have arrived in Pokémon GO! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep an eye out for them—we might find even more throughout the Season! Reports indicate that they are appearing at mysterious new Power Spots being discovered across the globe. Rally your friends to take on new Max Battles, catch these mighty Pokémon, and unlock the power of newly discovered Max Particles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Dynamax Phenomena will first appear on Sept. 10, in Pokémon GO, and select Pokémon will make their Pokémon GO Dynamax debuts in one-star Max Battles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event starts as soon as the Galar Pokémon launch event finishes and features two new shiny-eligible Pokémon in Max Raid Battles. This event is part of the new Max Out Season which starts on Sept. 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those that don’t know, Dynamax is a mechanic that let’s Pokémon transform into a Giant Pokémon during battle. To do this, a special arena is made for Pokémon to do this. As of now, Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur are the three Pokémon reported to be set for the Dynamax debut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another part of the Seasonal Special Research story will be available to all Trainers beginning at the start of the event. Trainers can complete tasks focused on Max Battles to earn Max Particles, a new avatar item, and more!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can claim this Special Research at no cost from Tuesday, Sept. 3, at 10 a.m. to Tuesday, Dec. 3, at 9:59 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An exclusive Max Particle Pack Bundle will be available on the Pokémon GO Web Store for $7.99 in the US starting Sept. 8, at 9 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Max Particle Pack Bundle will feature six Max Particle Packs, for a total of 4,800 Max Particles for all your Dynamax needs!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we look forward to September! For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pokemongolive.com/">www.pokemongolive.com</a>. Until next time Trainers!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
