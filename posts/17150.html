<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer battled powerful Tolland on Thursday, dropping a tough 8-1 decision from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles improved to 3-0 overall while the Kingstreeters fell to 0-2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed 4-0 after forty minutes of play and never got back into the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tolland outshot Eastern 28-1 but, on the Lancers only attempt on a goal, the home team made their collective move count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And nearly in record time!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immediately after the Eagles notched its sixth goal, Eastern put a dent on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of the fastest turnarounds of a goal scored, the Lancers went directly on the attack as Kate Patterson scored her first career goal on a breakaway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow, Patterson tallied her score in a matter of five seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens started the attack as she slipped a pass back to Leah Roy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy zipped down a through ball to Patterson who beat the keeper for her first varsity goal.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern goalie Abigale Pelletier was under fire for most of the outing, scooping up 15 saves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Beebe saw some action in the net for the Lancers as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters are back in action on Tuesday to finish up the home stand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern looks to win its first match of the campaign against Northwest Catholic in a CCC Interdivisional contest at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
