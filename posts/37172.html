<p>NEWINGTON -- The Bristol Central football team is going to have a chance to finish its 2023 campaign at .500 thanks in part to a huge 20-17 CCC Tier III victory at Newington on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tremendous win for the program (4-5 overall) as fourth quarter heroics helped stave off pesky Newington (2-7).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After starting the campaign at 1-5, the Rams have won three straight games and earned a real shot to break even when Central and Bristol Eastern lock horns on Thanksgiving in, perhaps, the last ever showdown of that holiday tradition between the schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central could also completely knock the Lancers out of state tournament qualification with a victory before eating a little turkey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Nor-easters, the Rams had three rushers gain yardage, keeping the chains moving for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper led the offensive charge by collecting 87 yards on 15 carries while Anthony Paulino (three carries, 31 yards) made every rush count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Donovan Rodriguez helped to carry the offensive load on the ground and in the air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nabbed 73 yards on 20 carries while making 2-of-5 passes for 49 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lamarre added two big PATs -- out of three attempts -- while Paulino ran in a kickoff return to help spur the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paulino was all over the place in terms of special teams -- blocking a field goal to stave off the loss over a huge game-saving play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington QB Enzo Corvino was held to just 2-of-12 passing for 29 yards and a touchdown thanks to outstanding defense by the Rams as Tashawn Cauley (1.5 sacks), Quincy Lawson (sack), Jack Jones (sack) and Jayden colon (half-sack) put all sorts of pressure on the Nor’easter’s signal caller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Caleb Simard picked off a Corvino pass, Jones made a team leading 13 tackles (two for a loss), Tim Sample nabbed five tackles while Nate Davis, Jack Hartley, Lawson (two tackles for losses) and Cauley (three tackles for losses) all wrapped up four tackles apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central out-gained Newington 240-184 overall while notching 13 points in fourth period play to eventually steal the game away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor-easters rushed for 155 yards but was limited to just three points over the final 12 minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was a 7-7 stalemate at the half while Newington scored a third period TD, leading 14-7 with 12 minutes to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then a wild and wooly fourth period by Central’s defense make all the stops save a field goal by Newington’s Jason Gogol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central ended up scoring those 13 fourth period points, making a huge comeback late, to drop Newington by three points with the showdown against Eastern on tap.</p>
