<p>BRISTOL - In a very unusual CIAC state tournament predicament, the Bristol Central boys basketball team is in a back-to-back situation tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, ranked No. 1 in the Division II bracket, have a less than 24-hour turnaround as the locals, at 25-0, are in the quarterfinal mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s going to be one heck of a challenge as No. 8 Waterford (19-6) comes to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest takes place tonight at BCHS at 6 p.m. and, frankly, there’s no rest for the weary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s an interesting scenario,” said Central coach Tim Barrette about the Waterford game. “There’s no prep [time] for either team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown is going to mark the final game for Central’s senior core of eight seniors strong - including the 2020-21 Gatorade Connecticut Boys Basketball Player of the Year Donovan Clingan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of this contest moves on to semifinal round play on Tuesday, March 15 against the winner of No. 4 Wilton and No. 5 Holy Cross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staples (18-7) let a golden opportunity slip by in its second-round showdown against the Lancers (not our Lancers. That’s Waterford’s nickname as well) but a huge 3-pointer by Sean O’Connell tied the game late - forcing the overtime session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, an 8-0 Waterford run knocked out Staples over the final four minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have some size and length and O’Connell - a talented 6-foot-4 senior - collected 20 points and 11 rebounds against Staples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan will be matching up against sophomore center Juan Morel Jr (10 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks versus Staples), an athletic 6-foot-8 center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But does he have enough length to slow down a motivated Clingan?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That senior class from Central includes Damion Glasper, Carson Rivoira, Steve Alseph, Victor Rosa, Zach Vanasse, Aaron Brown, and Jelani Walton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be one final time to see Clingan and those seniors strut their stuff from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol and it’s a big deal no matter how you slice it.</p>
