<p>Grammy-nominated vocalist Steve Lippia will return to his hometown of Bristol on Dec. 7, to perform his popular holiday show,&nbsp;<em>A Swingin’ Holiday Affair</em>, at the Rockwell Theater. </p>

<p>Known for his evocative vocal style and high-energy performances, Lippia will be backed by a dynamic swing band for an evening of festive tunes and timeless classics.</p>

<p>“My love of music began to blossom while I was a student at St. Paul Catholic High School in Bristol, CT,” Steve Lippia said. “Sister Marianne was the Director of the Chorus, and she was unrelenting in her efforts to build, promote and develop the choral program at St. Paul.&nbsp; She taught us so much and inspired in us a great appreciation for the beautiful compositions of such composers as Mozart, Bach, Handel, Schuman and others.”</p>

<p>The world-class entertainer credits Sister Marianne for sparking his musical passion. He recalls his first encounter with her during the St. Paul entrance exam.</p>

<p>“Upon entering the hallway, Sister Marianne, without skipping a beat, blew softly into a pitch pipe and asked me to hum the note she had just played.&nbsp; Then she asked me to sing a&nbsp;few measures of "Swanee River,<em>"</em> she wrote down a comment on her clipboard, thanked and excused me.&nbsp;It all happened so quickly that after wondering what just happened, I eventually forgot about it; until about 6 months later when school began, and I was told, as were many others, that I was now a member of the chorus.”</p>

<p>A year later, Lippia auditioned for St. Paul’s annual variety show, choosing to perform Frank Sinatra’s&nbsp;“It Was a Very Good Year". The vocalist rented a tuxedo for the performance, which was a huge hit with the crowd of nearly 800 people. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since then, Lippia’s career has skyrocketed. He became known for his vocal mastery of the Great American Songbook and has earned a Grammy nomination for his work. His smooth, Sinatra-esque vocals have made him a favorite at symphonies across the country, where he has performed with over 150 orchestras, including the Boston Pops.</p>

<p><em>Steve Lippia,&nbsp;A Swingin’ Holiday Affair</em>, offers a perfect blend of high-energy swing and crooning ballads, transporting audiences to the golden age of Sinatra and the Rat Pack. The show will feature lively renditions of seasonal classics like&nbsp;“Let It Snow”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Santa’s Coming to Town,”&nbsp;along with soulful ballads such as Irving Berlin’s&nbsp;“White Christmas.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> In addition to his holiday repertoire, Lippia will bring his signature charm and powerful voice to year-round hits like&nbsp;<em>“</em>Come Fly with Me,”&nbsp;“All the Way,”&nbsp;“Lady Is a Tramp,”&nbsp;“New York, New York,”&nbsp;“I’ve Got You Under My Skin,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Luck Be A Lady.”</p>

<p>“Along the way I've earned a Grammy nomination, made national television appearances, been featured in the Wall Street Journal &amp; other major publications, performed overseas, headlined in major showrooms in Las Vegas &amp; Atlantic City Hotels and have starred with over 150 Pops Orchestras throughout North America including the Boston Pops. I continue to tour with my Music Director, Steve Sigmund - a Ray Charles alumnus and my 10-piece band and Pops Orchestras.”</p>
