<p class="has-medium-font-size">Roland O. Pelletier, 71, of Bristol, loving husband of Bonnie (Brand) Pelletier passed away on Monday, July 4, at Sharon Health Care Center. He and Bonnie had celebrated 45 years of marriage two days prior to his death.  </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Roland was born Sept. 24, 1950, in Lille, Maine, to the late Daniel and Germaine (Choinard) Pelletier. Roland attended St. Ann Grammar School, Seminary High School in Bucksport, Maine, and received a degree in business from the University of Hartford.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a Bristol resident, he was employed for 24 and a half years at Associated Spring. In his retirement he worked full-time at FedEx Ground and ended his working career at City True Value Hardware. Roland’s first love was music. As a member of St. Matthew Church in Forestville, he was a long-time cantor and choir member. Most recently he also sang at St. Gregory the Great Church in Bristol. He also enjoyed playing guitar with his family especially at Christmas Eve gatherings held every year at Bonnie and Roland’s home. Their house was filled with laughter and enthusiastic singing from over 50 family members.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition to his wife, he is survived by seven brothers and their wives: Leo and Pauline, Lucien and Kathy, Roger and Gloria, Paul and Linda, Thomas and Katie, Normand and Kim, Michael and Victoria; a sister and her husband:  Theresa and Gary Morneault; a sister-in-law and her husband:  Laurie and Jim Gillette; three Godchildren: Bonnie Lynn Pelletier, Jessica Morneault, and Stephanie Gillette. He is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews who he immensely loved and adored. He was predeceased by a brother, Patrick Pelletier.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Bonnie would like to express her sincere gratitude to the staff at Sharon Health Care Center for their compassionate care of Roland during his year-long stay. She would especially like to thank a wonderful staff member, Sheena, who Roland loved dearly.  They even had affectionate nicknames for each other. Without her, “Rollie’s” journey would have been even more challenging.</p>
