<p>Hosting live music and providing food to go along with its craft beers is The New Cambridge Project's way of contributing to a tradition that started with Firefly Hollow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Saturday musician, Benny Mikula, performed while Red Apple Pizza Truck was on hand for those who brought their appetite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This time of year is very hit or miss for anyone in retail because people are [mostly] on vacation,” NCP owner James Ferro II said, and added that the number who show up for the live music events typically depends on the number of people who follow the performer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Saturday around 50 people came to the brewery to enjoy drinks and listen to the live music.</p>

<p>Ferro said there have been Saturdays when the tap house/brewery attracts between 100-150 people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Last weekend we had a lot of people coming,” he said. “This weekend we don’t have a lot.”</p>

<p>The New Cambridge Project is located at the former Firefly Hollow off Center Street. The project has for its goal operating as a brewery collective. NCP owns the rights to Firefly Hollow and brews its products on site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among its plans, aside from being a collective, is to build out a kitchen and offer a menu of its own. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferro said live music and food typically draw people and he said that he hopes the combination will attract more people to enjoy the craft beers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The New Cambridge Project is located at 139 Center St. Its hours are Tuesday, 3 to 8 p.m.; Wednesday, 3 to 9 p.m.; Thursday and Friday, 3 to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 12 noon to 10 p.m.; and Sunday, 12 noon to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
