<p>Margo (Pelletier) Bard, 64, of Bristol, passed away on Sunday, July 3, after a long hard-fought battle with cancer with her loving husband, Ricky Bard, by her side. Margo was born and raised in Meriden and was one of five children of the late Marcel and Marguerite (Dutil) Pelletier. The ultimate Disney fan, she was a longtime General Manager for Friendly’s Restaurants, most recently on the Berlin Turnpike, Newington.</p>
