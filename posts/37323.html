<p>Diana was beautiful, incredibly strong, and had a generous heart. Her kindness shone brightly upon human beings and animals in equal measure. Her amazing sense of humor filled the 24 years of marriage to her devoted husband Timothy Regan with Love and laughter. Diana cherished her children Patrick and Danielle above all else. </p>

<p>Neighbors regularly stopped by to compliment her as she tended to her lovely Dahlias, while her cat Stella rolled in the grass nearby. Diana will be missed by her loving family, loyal friends, and coworkers, who are grateful for the time God gave us with her. She will live on in our hearts and be ever remembered for the Light she brought to our lives.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
