<p>The Bristol Farmer's Market kicked off its 2024 season on Saturday, drawing a robust crowd of local residents and visitors from across Connecticut to its new location on 10 Main St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the leadership of the newly formed nonprofit, The Bristol Farmers Market, Inc., this year's market promises a fresh start with expanded offerings and a vibrant community atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I had this on my calendar for months," remarked Linda Fries, a regular attendee. "I wouldn’t miss it. I like to walk around and see what’s here, but my favorite place, Tonn’s Marketplace, is always my first stop. I can’t get tomatoes like this anywhere else."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The market buzzed with activity as patrons perused a diverse array of offerings, from farm-fresh vegetables and fruits to homemade soaps and crafts. Local businesses and farms showcased their finest products, including maple syrup, baked goods, and other locally produced consumable products.</p>

<p>"I like this location better because I can go eat afterwards," said Eva Martinez, delighted by the new setup that combines shopping with dining options. "I never knew this restaurant was here, so I think it’s nice that they put food and shopping together. I got some of that maple kettle corn for later too. They had samples and I thought ‘this is the best kettle corn I ever had.'"</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attendees were entertained by a live acoustic performance from local musicians Martin &amp; Read as they shopped under the sunny skies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the returning favorites were Perkins Pure Maple Sugar, Gresczyk Farms, Amazing Love Farm and Better Baking by Beth. New additions to the market this year, like New Cambridge Project, were well received by eager patrons.</p>

<p>The Bristol Farmer’s Market will continue to operate weekly on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at its new location in the parking lot of 10 Main St. through Nov. 2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
