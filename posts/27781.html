<p>WEST HARTFORD - It felt like old Zone 1 times on Friday evening when the Bristol American Senior baseball team squared off against West Hartford from Conard High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Zone 1 programs now reside in Zone 3 and in the only showdown of the year between the two squads, Post 96 managed to get the better of Bristol - snaring a 10-2 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 fell to 3-3-1 overall but got a really good effort out of starter Gavin Colvin (3 IP, five hits, three earned runs, two strikeouts).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He proved his worth over his first start at the 19U level, keeping his squad in it early.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Gavin pitched well,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “We really got burned on [West Hartford] quails [bloopers]. They must have hit six or seven quails. It was a little one here [and] a little one over there.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford generated a run in the bottom of the first, but it could have been a lot worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out, Matt Santoro walked aboard but was erased on a Max Hanawalt fielder’s choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myles Fournier then singled to put men on first and second and off a hit-and-run by James Sauer, the runners were on the move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hanawalt came home to score on Sauer’s single to right, but Bristol’s Cole Caccamo threw out Fournier going into third base as the slick defensive play kept it a 1-0 game through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo led off the top of the second with a hopper that slipped into left field, and he advanced to second on a passed ball before getting stranded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 nabbed another run in the bottom of the tilt as Trevor Tanis reached base on an error, a passed ball sent him to second while a failed pickoff attempt saw the runner reach third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a Hebert fielder’s choice, a ball that bounced off the shoulder of Ryan Maglio at third base, Tanis scored to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank goodness Ryan didn’t get really hurt,” said LaPenta of Maglio on the play. “I’m sweating. He’s our number one pitcher and he takes one right off his throwing shoulder.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford ended up loading the bases, but Colvin induced a strikeout while a fly out to left ended the frame with the home team leading by just two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was throwing his breaking ball for a strike,” said LaPenta of Colvin. “He was ahead. He had just a couple bad breaks.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, Post 2 put the go-ahead run at the dish but simply could not push it through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back-to-back errors by the West Hartford third baseman allowed Colvin and Elliot Norris to reach base safely with one away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Jayden Churchill hit into a fielder’s choice, the runners never advanced any further as Post 96 maintained its 2-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sauer just snuck a triple past Caccamo in right, who had his glove on the ball off a slick diving effort, in the third and scored on a passed ball - making it a 3-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, an infield hit, and a 6-3 groundout scored two additional runs as Bristol entered the top of the fourth down 5-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 finally cracked the board in the fourth after Caccamo was robbed of a hit by a slick leap and catch by the first baseman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hit the ball hard but right at people,” said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, the two-out rally saw Nick Sconziano drop a single into right and when Edward Sanchez (2-for-3 dumped a deep-dish double to center - plating the lead runner - Bristol chopped the deficit to 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Post 96 answered with two runs in the bottom of the fourth, giving the home squad a 7-1 lead as the fifth frame commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol knocked starting pitcher Tristan Baron out of the game in the fifth as Norris snagged a single to left-center and two away, Maglio smacked a slick double to the gap in right - scoring Norris - as the deficit was 7-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo followed up with a walk and Baron’s night was complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sauer came in throw and got Connor Cyr to pop-out at short as West Hartford escaped a jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the stanza, Roberge was one strike away from a 1-2-3 inning, but three consecutive singles led to two runs and a 9-2 push for West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was happy Isaac threw okay,” said LaPenta of Roberge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanchez added his second hit of the showdown in the sixth, a single to left, but never made it off first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford’s James Berry led off the sixth with a home run, making it 10-2, and made way for Bristol’s Josh Dunn to throw from the hill with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dunn induced the final two outs and going into the top of the seventh, Post 2 was chasing eight runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol never put anything together as West Hartford maintained its lead in the Zone 3 National division with its 10-2 win from Conard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re a decent club,” said LaPenta of West Hartford. “They can hit a little bit. This is one of those games where I want to win it but I’m not wasting a top pitcher here. We only face them once and I told the guys the goal is to be playing our best baseball at the end of the year come playoff time."</p>
