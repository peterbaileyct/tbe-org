<p>It was a busy week for the scholastic lacrosse programs at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between both the boys and girls teams, those athletes earned some big victories for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at this week’s action:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse a winner against Windsor and Middletown</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a tough two-goal loss against Bristol Central this past Monday, the Kingstreeters quickly got to the pay window against Windsor on Wednesday as the Lancers easily nabbed a 17-3 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo of Emma Stavens and Ciara Collins dropped in six goals apiece while Vanessa Drury and Alison Sullivan each popped in two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Hartley also netted a score for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio of goals the Warriors scored were the fewest that keeper Avery Ellis and the defense allowed this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Friday, Eastern won again - sinking Middletown for a 13-10 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins and Stavens were scoring machines as the Lancers tallied six second half goals just eight minutes into the second half to help stave off the Blue Dragons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maggie Kozikowski also nabbed a goal, Ellis was solid in the net and Jayna Hatcher and Leah Roy were tremendous on the defensive end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 4-4 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol boys lacrosse coop also scores multiple victories</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys lacrosse team went 2-1 this week, dropping a tough 17-10 decision at Wethersfield last Monday but then beat Windsor (16-5) on Thursday and defeated Wolcott (16-4) on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team is now 4-4 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Spina had a career day, nearly notching double-figures in goals scored against Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spina dropped in nine goals while adding three assists against the Warriors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayden ‘Tank’ Cross added three goals while Brady Bell, Ian Reardon, Nathan Shorette &amp; Jack Hartley all scored for the Bristol outfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, Bristol blasted Wolcott by a dozen on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over both victories, Max Stevens was tremendous in the net.</p>
