<p>“By coming out for a great day of play and camaraderie, members of this community are supporting individuals and families who most need our help.”</p>

<p>Wheeler's Basic Needs Fund addresses environmental and social factors that interfere with a patient’s health and well-being, but which are not addressed by other means of funding. The fund allows Wheeler’s community health workers to address environmental conditions that might lead to poor health outcomes.</p>

<p>Since 2018, Wheeler’s Basic Needs Fund has served more than 8,500 patients. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wheelerclinic.org/donors/wheelers-basic-needs-fund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WheelerHealth.org/BasicNeeds</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
