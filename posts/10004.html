<p>The plan is to reassess the situation after the actual Christmas holiday.</p>

<p>"Due to an increase in positive COVID cases and confirmed transmission among athletes, all BPS athletic programs, games and practices will be paused immediately," according to an email obtained from the Bristol Public Schools.</p>

<p>The status of all programs will be reevaluated on Monday, December 27."</p>
