<p>Rick and Dana Kriscenski of Bristol have raised two successful daughters. They are Heather and Danielle, graduates of Bristol Eastern in 2005 and 2012, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with Heather, she’s an attorney with the Department of Justice and works for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, while also considered a law enforcement officer. She resides in Texas, is married to Justin Rhea and together they have a 9-month-old son they named Logan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting back to high school, Heather took part in soccer, swimming and tennis sports-wise.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danielle went on to graduate from UMass/Amherst and UConn Medical School. She’s married to Derek Skrzypek and is a surgeon for the Geisinger Health system in Pennsylvania.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, like her older sibling, Danielle played soccer at Bristol Eastern as both a goalkeeper and on-field player, while going on to play the sport at UMass. As far as soccer goes, she thanks her high school coach, Roland Loranger, for the work he put in to get her to the next level.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, I wrote about coach Jim Lorenzetti, now a Southington resident, and his 12-year-old son by the same name after their team captured the Bristol Little League Championship. Young Jim had batted and pitched the squad to the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, eight years later, the younger Lorenzetti is preparing for his sophomore college campaign. He’s a pitcher for Division l Iona in New Rochelle, N.Y. He’s 6-9 and 215 pounds in bringing a 90-mph fastball to the team as a freshman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll be draft eligible in 2024 and is represented by Baseball Players out of Detroit. He has a few teams showing interest in him with the college season starting this coming February.</p>

<p><strong>Jackson -- Johnson</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In last week’s column I mentioned that Bristol native Andre Jackson, Jr., who played prep school basketball in this state, was on the UConn men’s roster as a sophomore as is Donovan Clingan. Bristol Edition reader Rick Ricciuti knew better and informed me that it was Andre Johnson, Jr., instead.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve had a number of folks tell me they’ve seen this column and enjoy it. Thank you! Some of these individuals are Joan and Nelson Forman, Carol Denehy, Don Provost and Bob and Judy Kelly. I went to Bristol Eastern when Bob was there, but I never had him for a class. However, he was my favorite teacher there that I never had. I’ve let him know this on occasion, and with this, Judy sent me this email: </p>

<p>“You were the best student he never had.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Donald Provost</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who doesn’t like Don Provost? I’ve known him since our Stafford School days. He was going to be in my wedding years ago but couldn’t get leave from the Navy. A resident of Burlington for many years now, just over the Bristol line, he’s been a volunteer with the town’s fire department since being a young man.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
