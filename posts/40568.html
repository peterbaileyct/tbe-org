<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Main Street Community Foundation is now accepting applications for over 90 scholarship funds, the organization announced in a release yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These scholarships are available to graduating high school seniors, current college students, and adult learners who are or will be attending two- or four-year colleges, as well as technical schools and career certification programs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also scholarships available for students attending elementary and secondary private schools in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deadline for all application submissions is March 8. A full list of available scholarships, their eligibility criteria, and links to the online application are available on the MSCF website: <a href="http://mainstreetfoundation.org/apply-for-scholarship">mainstreetfoundation.org/apply-for-scholarship</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each scholarship fund has specific eligibility criteria defined by the donors when the fund was established. Criteria includes items like interests and career goals, academic standing, financial need and town residence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A volunteer selection committee will then review each application and recommend the recipients based on the established criteria. All applications are reviewed through a competitive, blinded application process which ensures the selection committee is not biased in their determinations.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
