<p>The Bristol Central golf team has been battling all the elements to date over a very tough CCC Southern division slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams started the season at 3-1 and was just a few strokes away from an undefeated campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won its opening match against Plainville on Tuesday, April 19 by a score of 172 to 224 from Hawks Landing Country Club in Southington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Scott Petrosky led the way as the medalist for the Rams with a score of 39.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Umar Malick started his season off strong with a 41, freshman Joey Pikiell nabbed a 44 and senior Carson Rivoira carded a 48 to finish out the scoring for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then two days later, the Rams improved to 2-0 on the year with a hard fought 179-186 victory over Maloney at the Pequabuck golf club.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky was again medalist for the Rams, matching his 39 from the opening match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira and senior Tyler D'Agastino both shot a 46 to help the hometown club hold off a tough Spartans squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, April 25, Central dropped its first match of the season to Middletown from Pequabuck, 192-195.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky had another solid day on the greens, dropping in an eagle on his ninth hole to secure medalist honors with a score of 37.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky made an impossible chip shot from behind the trees to win medalist honors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of the squad had a tough round on the much harder back nine at Pequabuck.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undefeated Blue Dragons have an early lead in the chase for the CCC South championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central rebounded nicely after its only defeat of the season, downing Platt by a score of 183-194 from Hunter Golf Club in Meriden yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, in blustery conditions, were led by Petroskyâ€™s 39 - securing his fourth medalist position in as many matches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell provided the thrill of the day with a hole in one on the sixth hole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was his first career eagle to go with the hole in one honor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell shot a 44, Malick carded a 49, and Rivoira finished the scoring at 50. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are currently 3-1 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, the Central program has three matches, including a huge showdown against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But first on Monday, the Rams squares off against Windsor (2:45 p.m.) from Pequabuck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day, Central battles the Kingstreeters (3 p.m.) from Chippanee Country Club in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Thursday, Central hits the road for a CCC South rematch against Middletown at Lyman Orchards.</p>
