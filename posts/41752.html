<p>Come Sunday morning, another grandchild will have had a 4th birthday party--pizza, cake and cupcakes, and lots of presents and lots of family. Among the presents, a lab coat--yes, of the white lab coat variety, and safety glasses. These young kids do have an imagination, and this one can sit down with a lab kit and dust away sand to uncover fossils and gems with the best of them.</p>

<p>At the same time, a magic wand--compliments of a cousin and uncle and aunt--comes in very handy to make people appear and disappear at will, especially if one does something that may irritate the wielder of the wand. "Be gone!" Four is a magical age.</p>

<p>The party was on Saturday and following the party Mary and I headed to the NAACP event, honoring local activists for a Black History Month celebration at the Carousel Museum. Among the honorees were the late Rev. Eddie Whitehead, the late Johnie Floyd, Frank Robinson, Pastor Frank Collins, Laura Minor, Ellen Zoppo-Sassu, the late Barbara Hudson, Gail Williams, Jay Maia, Tony Floyd and Dayna Snell. We have wonderful people and their wonderful stories among us--if we listen.</p>

<p>TBE is in business, the business of providing high quality local journalism, and yes, of course, you know what is coming next--this enterprise has a cost. It's not much, a membership begins at $6 a month, but of course this price is only sustainable if there are a lot of people chipping in their $6. With that in mind, and until we can attract more members, we will be taking on advertising. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like the idea of taking on ads for the simple reason they also help us "cover" the city. It's always nice to see the businesses and nonprofits that aren't in the news represented alongside our posts and on our pages. It's one more way of saying to Bristol, "Hello, we are here, too."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, there is an advantage to seeing your business on TBE, people read us. Our most recent statistics indicate that we get as many as 30,000 visits a week. Over the last year, we have had over a million. For information, click <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/advertise-with-us/">here</a>. (We are working on our "process," so if what appears on the advertising page is too onerous, email TBEadvertising@bristoledition.org and we'll get back to you asap.)</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week starts with something a little different. I have been listening to a Great Courses program, "The Modern Intellectual Tradition: From Descartes to Derrida," with Professor Lawrence Cahoone of The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. I am not suggesting this one is for everyone--it gets pretty involved--but it is a survey of philosophers and I like reading philosophy, so it's engaging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason I mention this is because Cahoone is interesting and very good at what he does. Of course, I searched for other things he might have done, and I came across a video where he discusses "Socialism Distortion" on the Faithful Politics podcast. I don't know much about the people behind the podcast, but this one is interesting. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/gqUUujilU10?si=fPfpggkLGlgtVdP5">here</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For reading, I am making my way through several books, ones that I have mentioned. There is "Poverty by America," "How To Live or A Life of Montaigne" and "IDA: A Sword Among Lions." So, I am looking for a novel. A fantasy series, "The Mists of Avalon," has been recommended. Anyone have a recommendation?

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
