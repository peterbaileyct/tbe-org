<p>BRISTOL – When the Bristol Central boys basketball team lost its starting core off its 2021-22 CIAC Division II state championship roster, the program needed several younger players to step up to help lead the squad this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sophomore Carmelo Thompson has been very helpful in that department.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first-year starter has given the Rams a little pep offensively as Thompson averages just under 10.0 points-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson is second on the team in points (128) and free throws made (19).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a 17-point performance earlier in the campaign and continues to improve by the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson helps take some of the pressure of Central big man Jayeson VanBeveren (13.4 ppg) and Mikey McMahon (7.0 ppg) in head coach Tim Barrette’s offensive schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s got great offensive game,” said Barrette of Thompson. “We just have to find some consistency. His effort was fantastic tonight [against East Catholic]. I thought he played very hard. We just have to find consistency in practice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He could be a really, really good player in this program.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against East Catholic, Thompson did well around the hoop – cashing in on a third period three-pointer – as the sophomore did his best to keep his team in the mix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up hitting a team-high 15 points on 7-of-13 shooting from the field to go along with five rebounds, including several offensively, to get Central additional attempts at the rim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson may not be a polished shooter but when he’s streaking towards the rim, he has the ability to finish with authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can bank a shot off the glass for two, grabs his share or rebounds in the paint, and can hit a three every once in a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson is a developing playmaker and isn’t afraid to bring the ball into the paint, making the defense commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has a deliberate style and will force the defense to react which helps open things up when Central goes to its high-low offensive attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the things to remember about Thompson is that he’s still just a sophomore and is adjusting to the varsity game on the fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette knows there’s another level Thompson can reach once he gets a little polish on his game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he can start hitting his long-range shots with any kind of consistency, Thompson’s game has unlimited potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for now, the shooter has given Central another weapon opponents cannot ignore, and he’ll continue to work to improve on his game as the season moves along.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s only a sophomore so I give him a breather,” said Barrette. “He just turned 16. You saw flashes tonight of what he can do. You’ve seen him throughout the year [and] we just have to find some consistency with him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The effort is good in games but to be a good player, we have to find the same effort at practice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> Carmelo Thompson battles for every loose ball.
