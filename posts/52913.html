<p>A brush fire just after 8 p.m. last night on the south side of Mountain Road was contained to an acre by the Bristol Fire Department by 10:30 p.m., according to a report from Deputy Chief David Simard.</p>

<p>"Engine 4 responded and found the fire on top of the hill and called for the department's brush truck with Engine 2," said Simard in an email. "The fire was about an acre in size but spreading rapidly due to the dry brush and leaves in the area."</p>

<p>Addition crews were called in to keep the fire from getting out of control and getting ahead of it.</p>

<p>"We were able to stop the spread rather quickly with fire rakes and backpack water tanks," he said. "The brush truck has a 200-gallon tank of water which was refilled a few times and used to soak the perimeter and extinguish any hot spots."</p>

<p>The last crew left shortly after 10:30 p.m. No injuries were reported, and no other outside departments were called to respond.</p>

<p>"There is a red flag warning throughout the state with an extreme fire danger in effect due to the dry conditions," Simard said. "We are asking the public to refrain from having any outdoor campfires even if they are contained in a fire pit.  Embers can travel large distances and ignite brush when these conditions exist."</p>
