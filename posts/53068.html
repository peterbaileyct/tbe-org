<p>Lack of rain, resulting in severely dry conditions that increase the chances of fire, are behind Gov. Ned Lamont declaring a state of emergency.</p>

<p>"The filing of this declaration will help provide state and local emergency management officials with the necessary tools to monitor and limit the threat of potential fires, respond to active fires, and respond to any additional fires that may state," Lamont said in the release dated Oct. 25.</p>
