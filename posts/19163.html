<p>The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team continues to battle over a tough 2022 campaign and this past Tuesday, the Lancers fell on the road to the Raptors – dropping a 5-0 decision in a CCC bout in Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 1-9-3 overall while RHAM moved to 3-10-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers just couldn’t get any shots off on goal over the first forty minutes of play but the offense started to churn a bit over the second half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the locals just couldn’t find pay dirt in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern stopped nine shots that day but trailed 3-0 at the half and never recovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors’ Maddy Murray tallied a goal with 22:48 remaining over first half play while teammate Halie Oman kicked one in with 11:45 showing on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with eight seconds left before the half, Julia Kasper put in one more score as the Lancers were down by three at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over second half play, Oman and Amy Forrest tallied goals to complete the 5-0 shutout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has three more matches to end the regular season this year and if everything falls into place, it’s possible the Lancers have a chance to win at least a couple of those.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters battles Wethersfield on Friday (6 p.m.) on the road and then on Tuesday, it’s Central/Eastern one more time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 4:45 p.m. in a boys/girls doubleheader from the turf field at BCHS and one day later, Plainville comes to town for a CCC South encounter at 6:30 p.m. from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
