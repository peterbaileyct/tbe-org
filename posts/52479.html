<p>The Registrar of Voters office has issued a statement to guide voters this Nov. 5 since the office anticipates high voter turnout after processing a high volume of voter registrations recently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If voters could enter the polling locations with ID ready and be directed to the appropriate street check-in, wait times can be diminished," writes administrator of elections and assistant registrar Jennifer Brunoli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The office has hired the maximum number of poll workers allowed by law to aid voters in any way needed, she adds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Be advised, that some locations have over 200 voters per hour so if you have any time constraints consider voting mid-morning or mid-afternoon when turnout tends to be lower," she writes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brunoli recommended that voters consider early voting, which begins Monday, Oct. 21 and continues through Nov. 3 in council chambers on the first floor of city hall, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except on Oct 29 and Oct. 31, when hours are 8 a.m. through 8 p.m.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voters who are away from Bristol on election day, are ill or with a physical disability might also consider voting by absentee ballot, she writes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Absentee ballot applications can be obtained through the Town Clerk’s office by calling (860) 584-6200 ext. 0 or online <a href="https://oabr-sots.ct.gov/">https://oabr-sots.ct.gov/</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The voting stickers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol residents who cast votes in the City Council District 3 special election will be familiar with the images in our featured photo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stickers, one a star with “I voted!” written inside against the background of an American flag and the other “I voted” written in red magic marker with a small American flag above “voted” and an image of Connecticut with the Bristol logo inside, are the winners of the 1st Annual “I Voted” Sticker Contest held by the City of Bristol Registrars of Voters office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creator of the first image, with the star, is Samantha Ferenc, a West Bristol Middle School student, whose favorite hobby is ice skating, owns a dog named Rudy and can speak three languages — English, Spanish and Polish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creator of the second image, with the state of Connecticut and the Bristol logo inside its boundaries, is Michael Pinette, a West Bristol Elementary School student, whose favorite hobby is fishing–he won this year’s Perry J. Spinelli Fishing Derby partnering with a friend — and who likes going outside but also likes playing video games.</p>
