<p>Luckily for TBE, a noted national geography magazine that shall remain nameless allowed their noted photographer,  J.M.  Krampitz, to do some free lance work here in Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The photo above is just one of the breathtaking panoramas he submitted to TBE. It is taken from the center of the field at the Hoppers dog park.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If one looks closely, there is a polar bear cub on the path to the right, which is a rare sight in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David Fortier, Editor-in-Chief of TBE, remarked that ”getting a photo with the polar bear sighting by this world renowned photographer is a huge get for The Bristol Edition. He would only deal with our publication because of our reputation in the city.”</p>

<p>The photographer has since left for his next assignment in Nepal.</p>

<p>Reporter’s note- although we share the same name, this photographer and I are not related.  However, I did discover that his father and my father are both fathers, which is especially relevant today.</p>
