<p>BRISTOL - After the success of the 2021 campaign, highlighted by the rushing exploits of UConn stud Victor Rosa and the playoff bound Bristol Central football program, the Rams had a tough season this past year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the program never gave up and despite entering Thanksgiving - in the 63rd Annual Battle for the Bell - on a seven-game losing streak, Central found the will to win against rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol’s annual ‘Super Bowl’ event, the Rams were able to topple the Kingstreeters by a 13-6 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, since the 2015 campaign, have enjoyed ringing the bell at the conclusion of the contest, and lead the series over the Lancers 38-23-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since losing to Eastern 20-18 during the thanksgiving Day battle of 2014, it’s been all Central ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A big part of that most recent victory was due to the exploits of senior Tre Blair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The athlete made his final effort a memorable one as he battered the Lancers for 207 yards on 35 carries for a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the 11th most rushing yards ever compiled on Thanksgiving and a huge effort that finally saw Central win for the first time since Week 2 of the scholastic campaign a 31-30 win at South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We trust him with the ball in that big spot,” said Jeff Papazian of Blair. “He’s going to come through and he did.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his tremendous efforts, Blair was named the Thomas R. Monahan Offensive Player of the Game - joining the likes of Timmy Washington (1999-01), D.J. Hernandez (2003), Dathan Hickey (2017) and Rosa (2019 and 2021) in winning the award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s some pretty amazing company for Blair to be connected to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair ended the season with 1,082 yards on 170 carries - leading to five rushing touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also led the team in receiving yards (168), touchdowns receptions (two) and co-led the program in receptions overall with eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central wasn’t ever completely able to shake Eastern this past Thanksgiving as the Lancers brought the defense to Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters held the Rams to right around its scoring average and Eastern had the ball late - needing just seven points to tie up the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that’s when junior defensive back Anthony Paulino made his presence felt for the second time of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After striping the ball and making a fumble recovery with 5:49 to go in the first half, it was time for the junior to spring to life defensively one final time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 39 second left on the scoreboard, Paulino snared a pass by Eastern’s Alex Corvo pass - stomping 14 yards into the end zone for an insurance touchdown - as Central’s edge was increased to 13-6 with 34 seconds late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh man, what a big play,” said Papazian of Paulino’s pickoff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was only the second turnover of the game by the Lancers and Paulino was responsible for both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Jones was all over the place defensively for the Rams along with Nik Salinas, Blair and a host of other athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central needed every tackle because even with a 7-0 lead in hand at the half, an eight play, 63-yard drive by the Lancers to open the third period saw the program hit pay dirt - trimming the deficit to 7-6 with 7:17 left - though Eastern missed the extra point attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Central did not score in the third period, something that the Rams suffered through the entire season, it was the defense - and Paulino’s interception - that gave the Rams an additional six points late to help augment the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You know we’re going to take Eastern’s best shot coming out in the third quarter,” said Papazian. “We haven’t been a second half team all year. We’re going to get their best shot. If we can absorb it and come back…the missed extra point really kind of settled the momentum a little bit there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salinas ended the campaign with 232 yards on 64 carries for three touchdowns while the injured Carmelo Thompson (35 carries, 106 yards) is a talented sophomore - with a bright future in hoop - and should be a featured rusher come 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what’s the bottom line for the seniors on the Bristol Central football team on Turkey Day?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those players have never known defeat on Thanksgiving and that’s a ledger not many competitors can boast after all those holiday battles from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m proud of them,” said Papazian of his senior class. “It wasn’t the easiest season but to their credit, they kept showing up trying to get better every week. With being undefeated on Thanksgiving and being able to persevere through a really difficult season, that’s their legacy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m just so happy they’re able to go out on top.”</p>
