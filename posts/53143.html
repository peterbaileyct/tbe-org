<p>Early voting is well underway in Connecticut, with more than 300,000 residents having cast their ballots as of Monday morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This marks the first time that Connecticut has offered early voting for a general election. Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas spoke about the highlights of the first week of early voting in the state at a press conference on Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I am proud to share that voters around Connecticut report a smooth roll-out for the first ever early voting period for a general election,” Thomas said. “60 percent of voters wanted early voting. They got it and it’s been inspiring to see how well received and utilized it’s been.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>During early voting, residents complete their ballots at designated polling places, seal them in envelopes, and place the envelopes in secure boxes. The ballots will remain unopened until Election Day.</p>
