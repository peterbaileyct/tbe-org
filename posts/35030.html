<p>A woman has been taken into police custody after entering the Bristol Police Department last night and shooting multiple rounds into the lobby. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman, 51-year-old Suzanne Laprise of Plainville, entered the Bristol Police Department at approximately 10:35 p.m. on Thursday, and fired multiple rounds into the front lobby desk window according to a release from the Bristol Police Department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lobby was unoccupied at the time, and the rounds did not penetrate the bullet-resistant glass. When officers rushed to the scene, Laprise responded by firing additional rounds at police officers. The additional rounds were also stopped by the bullet resistant glass, according to police. </p>

<p>When Laprise set down her firearm, officers deployed an electronic control device and took the subject into custody without serious injury. Laprise was released from the hospital early this morning and was taken into Bristol Police Custody. </p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
