<p>ROCKY HILL – The Bristol Eastern baseball team ran into a buzz saw in the form of undefeated Rocky Hill on Thursday afternoon as the Lancers fell by a 17-1 final in a CCC interdivisional romp by the Terriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to 2-3 overall while Rocky Hill moved to a sterling 8-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was called after four-and-a-half innings as Eastern used six pitchers over the CCC interdivisional bout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those chuckers allowed 11 walks while plunking five batters along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Kingstreeters gave it a whirl in the top of the first, attempting to draw first blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Connor Cyr was hit by a pitch to start the game, went to second on a wild pick-off throw, while Ben D'Amato's single to right put runners on the corners with one out, setting the table nicely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a strikeout and pop up ended the half-frame while the Terriers offense was clicking from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom half of the first, Rocky Hill scored two runs without the benefit of a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern starting pitcher Mike Roalf walked leadoff batter Jaiden Reyes who later stole second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next batter also walked and a double steal moved the runners up a base.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sacrifice fly scored Reyes, making it 1-0, and a hit batter and another walk loaded the bases for the home team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf was lifted for Noah Gatti and a sacrifice bunt from Ben Centurelli scored another runner as the Terriers nabbed a 2-0 push.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocky Hill padded its till with six runs in the second inning and three more in the third before a six-run fourth frame propelled the Terriers to an imposing 17-0 cushion – needing just nine hits to tally all that offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth, Eastern went on to score its lone run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Rio Fernandez doubled to left center, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kyle Babin, making it a 17-1 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato led Eastern’s six-hit attack with two singles, but the locals could not inch any closer in the end.&nbsp;</p>
