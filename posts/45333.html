<p>Junior captain Logan Rembish led the St. Paul Falcons to a 10-0 win over the Wolcott Eagles at Dunkin' Park in Hartford Thursday evening. </p>

<p>From the mound, Rembish picked up his fourth win of the year going three and two-thirds innings allowing only two singles while striking out five. From the plate, Rembish drove in the first two runs of the game in the first inning and the final run of the game in the sixth inning; both on bases loaded singles.</p>

<p>The score remained 2-0 until the bottom of the fifth inning. With one out, Keaton Kroll and Cal Chance walked. Dagata had an RBI double driving in Kroll, and Corrado hit a sacrifice fly to right driving in Chance. St. Paul led 4-0.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the sixth, three consecutive singles by Seth Meuer, Brian Anderson, and Mike DeRosa loaded the bases with no outs. That ended the day for reliever Ben Bianchi, and Zach Lawlor came in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to Jay DeRosa made it 5-0 with the bases still loaded. Kroll then hit a bases clearing double to make it 8-0. After a walk to Chance, an RBI single by Dagata made it 9-0. Corrado was hit by a pitch, and that set things up for Rembish who ended the game with an RBI single.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
