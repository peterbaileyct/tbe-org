<p>The Bristol Junior American Legion Baseball program (17U) continues to impress out the gate in 2023, refusing to lose as the season is off and running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Juniors are playing really well,” said Bristol 19U coach Jerry LaPenta. “They’re 3-0 with a tie. We’ve got a nice team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the squad churns out the wins, opponents have been troubled on how to top the Bristol program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with an 8-8 tie going against Tri-County, the showdown will recommence on Monday from the point of its postponement after seven innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was ahead by three runs late in that showdown but gave the lead up, now stuck on an 8-8 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That continuation will come after the completion of the 19U’s tilt against Northeast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time for the 19U contest is at 5:45 p.m. with the conclusion of the Junior Legion game to follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Games</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 started the season with four games in five nights - leading to the perfect 3-0 ledger and the one tie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick summary of all the action:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 6 - Bristol 2, Ellington 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky pitched a one run, three-hitter as Bristol secured a late run to nab a 2-1 win against Ellington from Riley Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just a double and triple to Troy Enamait, but the rest of the squad shared a combined one hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 7 - Bristol 4, West Hartford 3</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following night, Post 2 made a sweet come-from-behind victory to knock off longtime rival West Hartford by a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors scored twice in the third and once in the fourth frame to snare a three-run cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol notched two runs in both the sixth and seventh stanzas to overcome that 3-0 deficit - turning it into a one-run triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Colvin threw twenty pitches in relief over the final two innings of regulation, seizing the win late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky and Jonathan Montgomery paced the offensive with two hits apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Schenck nabbed a double while Molinsky added two RBI over the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery did not factor into the decision but allowed just three runs over five innings to keep his mates hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Ryan, Gabe White, Brayden Schenck, Mason Harris and Tate Stevens all etched up a hit for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 8 - Bristol 8, Tri-County 8</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was suspended after seven innings of play as darkness engulfed the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the stalemate against Tri-County on the road, the squad finally got a night of rest on June 9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 10 - Bristol 10, NCL 2 (from Riley Field)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, just this past Saturday, Bristol foiled NCL behind a 10-hit attack - snaring an eight-run triumph to move to 3-0-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 snuck out 10 hits while NCL was limited to just four, making eight errors in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>White earned the win, throwing 65 pitches over his four innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He did not yield a run while Mason Harris and Jack Erickson mopped up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colvin and Brian Grabowski each smashed out two hits while Molinsky added a double to the till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery, Stevens, Grabowski and White all collected two RBIs apiece for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
