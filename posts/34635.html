<p>The Diversity Council introduced 4 new members during their regular monthly meeting at the Bristol Public Library on Tuesday night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are so happy to have them all joining us,” said Jaymie Bianca, Diversity Council chair. “I think this is a great group; they’re all bringing great ideas and perspectives to the council.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new Diversity Council members Olivia Chapdelaine, Sandra Kamens, Antonio Lopes and Jordan Lopez were appointed by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano at the Sept. 12 city council meeting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to these recent appointments, the Diversity Council had been operating with just five members; Bianca, Jeff Israel, Marcus Patton, David Rackliffe and Vice Chair Alison Willette for several months.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The primary focus of the meeting was the racist and white supremacist activity that Bristol has faced over the past few months, the most recent of which occurred last Monday when swastikas were found painted on signs at Northeast Middle School and racial slurs were discovered written on the sidewalk in Rockwell Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antonio Lopes, who recently retired from the Yale University department of pathology, said that he joined the council because he wanted to get out and do something about the recent incidences of racism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I couldn’t very well sit back and watch the things that are going on in the country happen in a town that had been relatively quiet when it came to racial rights.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bianca stated that she feels that there is a lot of work to be done, and that the council’s first step should be to speak out against these acts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think it’s important as a council that we do take a stance,” said Bianca “To say that we denounce white supremacy and we denounce racism and bigotry, and xenophobia, ableism. Just taking that stance and saying that we do, that is that first step. There's a difference between where to put a stop light and who has the right to feel safe and respected in a city.”<br></p>

<p>Among the initiatives that the council is currently collaborating on, are a resource list of organizations that promote the ideals of diversity, equity and inclusion in the city of Bristol, as well as a panel series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeff Israel, who is also a member of the Bristol Interfaith Coalition, is one of the organizers of the Diversity Council’s upcoming panel on religious diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have three speakers lined up right now,” Israel said. “As far as a theme, I think something like “Know Your Neighbor” is appropriate.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The council set a tentative date of Tuesday, Oct. 24, at 6 p.m. for the religious diversity panel. Bianca said the panel is particularly important following the discovery that signs promoting an anti-hate program in the Bristol Public Schools featured a mistranslation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The signs read “Hate has no home in our All-Heart city and BPS,” in English, with translations in Spanish, Arabic and Polish below. The Arabic translation on the original signs is gibberish. The signs that had been posted around the city were immediately removed when the problem was identified.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is really important,” said Bianca, “especially because the “No Hate” signs that were put up around the Board of Ed, and other parts of the city, the Arabic was translated incorrectly. I know the Superintendent sent out an apology email, but I think it just illuminates the importance of having a panel like this.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Diversity Council meets on the fourth Tuesday of every month at 6:30 p.m. with public participation beginning at 6:40 p.m. at every meeting.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
