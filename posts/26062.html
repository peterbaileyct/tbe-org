<p>BRISTOL – Whomever put the hex on the Bristol Eastern baseball squad needs to break it immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, comfortably ahead of CCC interdivisional opponent Edwin O. Smith by a 3-0 push with two outs in the seventh on Monday afternoon, never got to see the fruits of their labor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's because the Panthers scored five runs, all earned, with two outs in the seventh to eventually secure a 5-3 win from Clem J. Roy Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith is now 7-7 overall while Eastern fell to 3-9.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams tied the season series 1-1 and it was a tough luck no decision for Eastern pitcher&nbsp;Caleb Molinsky.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker threw shutout ball into the seventh, allowing just five hits, striking out seven and walking only one over a great effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was forced to leave the game in the seventh stanza when he reached the pitch limit while Ryan Maglio was tagged for the loss in relief.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that fateful seventh stanza, with the Kingstreeters ahead by three runs, Smith's Joe Willour started the tomfoolery when he lined Molinsky's first pitch into left for a single.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next batter flew out to right before&nbsp;Owen Sgro nabbed a base hit to left – putting runners on first and second.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Molinsky out of pitches, Maglio came in to throw and his first pitch was popped up to short for the second out of the inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Eastern just couldn’t get that final out before Smith unloaded its offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio walked Trevor Woodmansee to load the bases and when the next batter reached on an infield error, a runner scored to cut the deficit to 3-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the next batter reached on an infield miscue, another runner tagged the plate, and the game was a one-run affair at 3-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Winakor then singled to right, driving in the tying and go-ahead runs, with a third crossing the plate as the throw in from the outfield went wild.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the half inning, Maglio struck out the final batter, but the Panthers were able to charge out in front by a 5-3 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers went down in order in the seventh to end the game – propelling Smith to the surprise triumph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t all bad as&nbsp;Eastern took a 1-0 lead after a scoreless first frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rio Fernandez was hit by a pitch with one out but a grounder to short by Molinsky forced Fernandez out at second base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Babin then singled to left and when Gabe White reached on an infield single to third, Molinsky scored, and the Lancers earned a 1-0 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was still just a single run affair in Eastern’s favor when the home program added another to the till in the fifth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bunt single by Connor Cyr, coupled with a throwing error on the play, put the runner at second base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D'Amato later singled to right to score Cyr, propelling Eastern to a 2-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the Kingstreeters nabbed yet another run, this time in the sixth to make it a three-run cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez opened the sixth with a double over the left fielder's head to get into scoring position and when Molinsky bunted, no one was at first base to record an out, and suddenly, the sacrifice/base hit put runners on the corners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Babin then slapped a grounder to third and when the defender attempted to get Fernandez, who was retreating back to bag, he ended up safe as the bases were loaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a wild sequence, White flew out to center and the throw home to get Fernandez trying to score was on the money for the second out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky moved to third on the play, Babin eventually stole second, and when the pitcher threw wild to second, Molinsky scored for the 3-0 lead that eventually evaporated late in the game.&nbsp;</p>
