<p>Bristol's Elijah Parent, a shooting guard playing at the United States Coast Guard Academy, has helped the men’s basketball team to an 8-2 record through 10 games -- starting every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Eastern standout had a huge game at St. Mary’s on Dec. 30, helping the squad to an impressive 83-59 triumph on the road from the Michael P. O’Brien ARC Arena in Saint Mary's City, Md.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent filled up the stat sheet over the victorious effort, posting one of his best all-around games of his colligate career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 33 minutes, Parent hit 9-of-11 field goals, splashed in 4-of-6 from three-point territory, collected seven rebounds and dished out four assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those numbers were career highs for the talented Parent competing for the Coast Guard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also stole the ball four times -- also a career best - and committed just a couple of turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the program’s fourth consecutive win as the team did not lose a game during the month of December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Coast Guard also won the St. Mary’s Winter Classic, defeating Baruch 59-50 on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a tremendous start of the season for Parent, averaging 27.5 minutes-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s plenty of talented scores on the Bears’ program and Parent’s 10.2 points-per-game is good for fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent also kicks in 2.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.3 steals-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s shooting 53.3-percent from the field, 38-percent from deep and is hitting his free throws at an 89-percent clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sharpshooter has drained 14-of-37 shots from three and missed just one free throw (some say he might have missed two) all season long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent has scored in double figures four times while hitting multiple three-pointers on three occasions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his career, Parent has started 25 of 35 games, averaging 22.7 minutes a contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hitting 33.3-percent of his 3-point field goals, Parent has missed just four of his 28 career free throws (85.7-percent) and dished out a total of 60 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s scored 247 points over his 1.5 seasons on the collegiate level, averaging 7.1 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The three-point king at BEHS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over four varsity seasons for the Lancers, Parent drained 133 three-points, tops in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent also has the school record for threes made in a game, dropping in seven trifectas against Platt on February 11, 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also scored a career-high 33 points that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that same year, the shooter hit a season-record 62 three-pointers as Parent was as talented as any other marksman on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The athlete scored the 13th most points in school history, notching 707 points overall - good for an average of 10.6 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 67 career games, Parent hit 62-of-74 free throws, good for an 83.8-percent shooting clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shoot (threes) first, ask questions later</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone in the Parent family has played basketball at Bristol Eastern which includes father D.J., mother Bevin (Borajkiewicz), son Elijah and daughter Taigan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Elijah is tops in the programs in three-point field goals made, D.J. is currently in the top-50 on the boys side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D.J. has 24 career three-pointers -- 109 fewer than Elijah.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bevin played at a time when Tony Floyd’s girls basketball teams didn’t launch three-pointers like they do today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s all alone in 35th place in 3s made with 10 converted over her varsity stints.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, her three 3-pointers were tops for the program and one season later, Bevin hit seven more to lead the Kingstreeters over consecutive campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Taigan caught fire as a senior marksmen, hitting a single-season program record 60 3s in 2022-23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has 84 overall, good for third place all-time, while her seven three-pointers at Platt on January 12, 2023 tied the school record along with Hannah Maghini (112 career threes).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like brother Elijah, she also scored 33 points that night she tallied seven 3s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The final numbers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Parent family dropped in a total of 251 three-point field goals between the four of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the boys and girls programs have combined to hit a total of 4,345 three-pointers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means the Parents, as a unit, have hit 5.7-percent of all the three-pointers ever made at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion…</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what’s the bottom line here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you live by the 3 in the Parent family, you don’t die by it because more often than not, those long shots are reigning down like cash on payday.</p>
