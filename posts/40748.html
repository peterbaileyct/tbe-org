<p>Bristol- Ben D’Amato drained eight three point shots in the game Thursday, breaking the school record held jointly by teammate Jordan Chisholm and recent B.E. grad Elijah Parent, pacing the Lancers to a 76-33 triumph over Hartford Public. </p>

<p>D’Amato scored 24 points on his treys, a new career high, canned at least one three-pointer in every quarter and drained 8-of-9 attempts from long range.</p>

<p>The Eastern bench accounted for 34 total points and once the starters came back into the game during second quarter play, the home team established a 20-point edge by the half, never looking back.</p>

<p>“I thought we started the game really, really slow,” Eastern coach Bunty Ray said. “And we weren’t doing the things that we were supposed to do. We were kind of going one-on-one, kind of how we ended our last game [against Berlin] was how we picked up this game. We talked about that. We practice a lot against zones because [Hartford Public] didn’t really show very many man looks.”</p>

<p>“Every time we moved the ball, all of a sudden, we got open shots easily by doing the things we are supposed to do.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lancers led 14-7 through one period after a sluggish start but outscored the Owls 17-4 over second period play to construct a 31-11 halftime edge.</p>

<p>After three quarters, Eastern held a 53-21 cushion and late in the final stanza, D’Amato hit his school record eighth 3 to capture the milestone.</p>
