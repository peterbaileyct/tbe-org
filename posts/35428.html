<p>After the Bristol Eastern boys soccer program turned away rival Bristol Central (2-1) on Saturday, the Lancers were entangled in CCC interdivisional action on Tuesday against East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a scoreless affair until late before the Hornets were able to nab the only goal of the match as Eastern fell to East Hartford (1-0) from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hornets improved to 6-2-3 overall while the Lancers fell to 6-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford’s Jaden Enriquez nabbed the only score of the showdown with 7:26 remaining in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first half was scoreless as both sides found very few chances to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two near goals came when the Hornets' Abdul Rahman Jimbah broke in from the left midway through the period, but his shot went over the bar, as did the Lancers' Liam Sanchez-Barreto's attempt a few minutes later at the other end of the field.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that 0-0 stalemate lasted into the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"East Hartford was skilled and quick with the ball," said Lancers' coach Bill Sweet. "We worked extremely hard to contain them throughout the match.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the second half, the Hornets stole away the match with their late goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford's Nathaniel Balderrama sent a cross into the Lancers’ penalty that dropped freely, and Enriquez tapped it in for the game winner with 7:26 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And 1-0 was the final score of the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keeper Peyton Cummings collected nine saves while his&nbsp;counterpart, East Hartford’s Damian Mach, made seven stops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
