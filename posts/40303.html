<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5th Annual Community Conversation to feature a comedic approach to a serious topic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 5th Annual Community Conversation, focusing on ending the stigma of mental illness and featuring the comedic touring group, "1 Degree of Separation," will be held on Saturday, Jan. 20, 2024, at 6 p.m. at The Rockwell Theater at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attendance is free but program sponsor Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services recommends reserving a seat at <a href="http://BristolRec.com">BristolRec.com</a>, since seating is limited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The "1 Degree of Separation" website states, explicitly, that the show, with a subtitle of "A Funny Look at Suicide and Depression," is aimed at ending the stigma of mental illness through comedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Depression has one degree of separation: if you don't suffer, then someone you know does," the website states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following that statement is the group's aim "to bring dialogue, awareness, and acceptance for those suffering from depression through laughter and vulnerability."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement continues with, "We laugh at the dark stuff, because laughter releases the pain. We talk about depression, because no one should feel shame."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It concludes with this, "With an army of comedians, we hope to kill the stigma of depression and share stories of hope, happiness and triumph.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group's website and Facebook pages contain positive reviews of the show, with recommendations for others to see it. For the website, click <a href="https://www.1degreeofseparation.life/">here</a>. For Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1degreeofseparation">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thousands of old, low-level convictions set to be automatically erased over the next month</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than 80,000 people will have convictions for older, lower-level offenses cleared from their record over the next month, it was announced by Gov. Ned Lamont in a release last month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process to erase the vast majority of eligible records is expected to be completed by the end of January.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approximately 28,752 additional convictions for operation while under the influence, for which Clean Slate eligibility was modified in the 2023 legislative session, are expected to be erased by the end of March 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, another group of approximately 62,364 convictions will require manual confirmation due to imperfections in historical data. Those convictions will be processed manually over the course of the first half of 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The erasure of these old, low-level convictions comes in addition to the 43,754 low-level drug possession (mostly cannabis) convictions that the state already erased&nbsp;earlier this year with the law that legalized and safely regulates the adult-use of cannabis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is expected that the system will initially identify for erasure approximately 178,499 offenses from more than 80,000 people. Record erasure does not mean deletion or destruction; instead, erasure causes a record to be flagged for nondisclosure to anyone other than the clerk holding the records.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eligible offenses include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Any classified or unclassified misdemeanor (imprisonment less than one year), with a seven-year waiting period from the person’s most recent conviction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Class D, E, or unclassified felonies (imprisonment less than five years), or operating under the influence (General Statutes § 14-227a), with a 10-year waiting period from the person’s most recent conviction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be automatically erased, the offense must have been committed on or after Jan. 1, 2000. Earlier offenses may be erased via a petition to the courts under similar eligibility rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some specific charges are excluded from erasure, as is any sexually violent offense and nonviolent sexual offense. Any offense designated as a family violence crime is also excluded. Convictions cannot be erased on a person’s record unless the person has no pending criminal charges and the person has completed all periods of incarceration, probation, and parole imposed since Jan. 1, 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the most common felonies to be erased are burglary in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;degree, larceny in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;degree, and forgery in the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;degree. Some of the most common misdemeanors to be erased are larceny in the 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;degree (shoplifting), DUI and failure to appear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-279(c) imposed between Jan. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2015, were automatically erased at the beginning of 2023. People who meet those criteria do not need to do anything to have those convictions erased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Convictions for any of the following violations can be erased by petitioning the court:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-279 for possession of less than or equal to 4 ounces of a cannabis-type substance imposed before Jan. 1, 2000, and between Oct. 1, 2015, and June 30, 2021.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-267(a) for possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia for cannabis imposed before July 1, 2021.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-277(b) imposed before July 1, 2021, for manufacturing, selling, possessing with intent to sell or giving or administering to another person a cannabis-type substance and the amount involved was less than or equal to four ounces or six plants grown inside your home for personal use.</li>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut residents now qualify for Connecticut’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) if their monthly gross income is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (for example, $2,430 for a single person and $5,000 for a four-person household).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until October 2022, Connecticut’s limit was 185 percent of the federal poverty level ($2,248 for a single person and $4,625 for a four-person household). according to the announcement. The federal government allows monthly gross income limits up to 200 percent and Connecticut is now one of approximately 15 states to take full advantage of that allowance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SNAP enrollees are issued electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, which work like a debit card and are replenished for every month of eligibility. The cards can be used at thousands of participating food markets and grocery stores, convenience stores, farmers markets, and online at many retailers for food items approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service.</p>
