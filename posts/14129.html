<p>BRISTOL - Last Sunday, the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball program zipped up its first Zone 1 win, dropping Meriden by seven runs (8-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the rematch on Thursday, Post 45 notched a four-run sixth inning as Meriden snatched a 5-3 victory over Post 2 in a Zone 1 contest from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Gay pitched extremely well for Meriden, allowing three runs on five hits - striking out seven and walking just one - to tally the program’s first win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Andrew Lozier threw a near flawless first five innings but got a bit tired in the sixth, allowing four runs on three hits, to draw a tough loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He pitched great for not pitching in a long time,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Lozier.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was up 1-0 through the first five frames and were in firm control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the first Meriden batter was walked in the sixth, the next was hit by a pitch, and Bristol just couldn’t stop the bleeding from there as Post 45 reeled off four runs to snare a 4-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a lead and, I preach all the time, don’t let little innings turn into big innings,” said LaPenta. “They had the tying run on first with no outs and you know they’re going to bunt. You take the out, the tying run is at second. [But] we ended up hitting [Conor Bennett instead] and turned a little inning into a big inning.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Most likely there, if we get the out at first, there’s a guy at second [and] maybe they tie it and we have one out. The next thing you know, they score two runs, there’s no outs and it just turned into a big mess.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 responded with two runs in the bottom of the inning, nearly drawing even, but Meriden notched an insurance run in the seventh to help ice the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier struck Meriden’s Max Giacco with a pitch to open the showdown but Luis Delgado bounced into a 5-4-3 double play and John Remillard grounded out to the Bristol chucker as the inning was quickly over.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second, Gay drew a full count walk but Lozier induced a 1-6-3 double play to end the frame - the second of the game - as Ryan Fradette (2-for-3, two RBI) came to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He slapped a one-hopper to left to start the bottom of the third but was picked off first as opportunity came and went for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lozier was in the groove, going nine-up and nine-down, as the game entered the bottom of the third without the benefit of a score.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Gay was dealing as well, fanning the last two batters he faced in the bottom of the inning while Lozier threw just 42 pitches through four as neither pitcher let up much in terms of offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol added its second hit of the game in the fourth when Elliot Norris (2-for-3, two runs, steal) raced out an infield bunt to the right side of the mound and quickly swiped second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runner advanced to third on a Jayden Churchill groundout and Lozier brought Norris home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Avery Point standout chopped a single by the first baseman as Norris easily tagged the dish - giving Post 2 a 1-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think our at-bats have been good,” said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 45 broke up Lozier’s no-hitter with one away in the fourth as Gay cranked a single up the middle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gay went to second on an Alex Owen groundout but Sam Giacco flew out to Churchill in left as Bristol maintained its 1-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the sixth, Griffin Papallo opened the tilt with a base-on-balls while Bennett was plunked by a pitch as Post 45 had two out without the benefit of an out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We can’t defend walks…and some of the guys haven’t pitched in a while and I get it,” said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passed ball advanced both runners into scoring position and Giacco battled off eight pitches to eventually slap a two-RBI double to the gap in left as Meriden surged in front, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Delgado came through with a deep infield hit to shortstop, putting runners on the corners, and a passed ball scored Giacco - making it a 3-1 game - still with no outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dillon Hudson made a diving catch on a liner by Remillard, doubling up the runner at second who had left the bag early for Bristol’s third double play of the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ted Hanjewski then dropped a single into left and Gay followed with a walk as Tyler Martin came into the game in relief of Lozier with two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owen was hit in the helmet to load things up and a wild pitch scored Hanjewski to propel Meriden to a 4-1 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol chose to fight in the bottom of the sixth as Chris Osuch was hit by a pitch and Norris dropped a base hit to left off a tremendous diving effort from Remillard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Churchill at the plate, Osuch attempted to take third base but was picked off and when the batter flew out to left, there were two outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the rally was still on for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a surprising move, Lozier was intentionally walked - putting two on and the tying runner was at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The strategy backfired as Fradette, Bristol’s clean-up hitter, slapped a ball into the gap in left, clearing the bases, as the two-RBI double chopped the deficit to 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron’s fly-out to center ended the seventh but Post 2 was in it, trailing by just one run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adam hit the ball hard there with the tying run at second,” said LaPenta. “Thats’s all you can ask for.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill came in to pitch in the seventh and Caron, at third base, made a great catch and throw on a Papallo grounder, keeping the first batter of frame off the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Bennett walked and Giacco beat out an infield hit to third, putting men on first and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bennett was eventually tagged out at the dish while Giacco stole second, getting a nice throw-in from Norris and tag by Osuch at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Defensively, I think we’ve been playing really well,” said LaPenta of the season. “We had a nice first and third play there with a pickoff that kept a run off the board.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Giacco stole third, Delgado walked and the lead runner scored on an RBI single by Remillard - giving Meriden a two-run cushion at 5-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill struck out Hanjewski to end the half inning with Bristol down a couple runs and in the bottom of the seventh, Gay shutdown the Bristol side as Meriden secured a two-run win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got to clean up the walks,” said LaPenta. “And we have to clean up base running mistakes. We gave up two outs on the bases…little things like that cost you the game. I’m more disappointed because I think we beat ourselves more than they beat us. I know we gave them that [sixth] inning there.”</p>
