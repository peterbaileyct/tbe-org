<p>MANCHESTER - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis team squared off against a very good squad from East Catholic on Wednesday - falling to the Eagles by a 7-0 final from the tennis courts at Wickham Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (1-13) battled throughout the event and in the top slot in singles play, East Catholic’s Katie Green defeated Eastern’s Brooke Treannie - needing three sets to finally oust the Lancers’ star performer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Green won the first set (6-2) but was then shutout over the second as the match was afoot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treannie flipped Green over set two play (6-0), forcing a huge third and final game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third set, Green racked up a 10-2 victory over what turned into an epic bout.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 2 singles play, Reagan Queen beat Eastern’s Adrianna Reay by scores of 6-0 and 6-1 while the Lancers’ Vanessa Cyr was shutout by Gabriella Italia (6-0, 6-0) in the third slot.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally at No. 4 singles, Ceceli Johnson topped Eastern’s Trish Mohan by set scores of 6-1 and 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doubles play, East Catholic pulled off several big wins though the Lancers hung on until the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles top doubles team of Allie Long and Ashley Jeong defeated Eastern’s combination of Olivia Dossias and Trish Mohan (6-1, 6-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in No. 2 doubles, Annabelle Stabach and Mallory Krasusky swept the Lancers’ duo of Ava Gesner and Sam Rivard (6-0, 6-0) and finally, the team of Kate Santini and Sophia Simonett topped the Lancers No. 3 twosome of Jazz Pryce and Angelina Morrone (6-0, 6-2).</p>

<p>Off the win, East Catholic moved to 14-4 over the CCC Interdivisional encounter.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>On the official stat sheet from the game under ‘Court Conditions’ Eastern head coach Barbara Lessard listed that the playing facility had ‘lots of cracks.’ That’s what happens when you build tennis courts on fault lines and tectonic plates that love to shift without advance notice.</p>
