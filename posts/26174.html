<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until 1782, only officers received military awards&nbsp;for victories in battle. In that year, President George Washington designed a badge in the form&nbsp;of a cloth purple heart called the Badge of Military Merit. This purple heart was the first&nbsp;award&nbsp;in military history to be given to lower-ranking, enlisted soldiers or non-commissioned officers&nbsp;for their outstanding service. Three men received that award during the American Revolutionary War.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For over 150 years, the Badge of Military Merit was forgotten. It wasnâ€™t until WW I that an organized effort was made to create medals for levels of valor and&nbsp;merit. Also, during that war, American soldiers wounded in battle were awarded&nbsp;wound chevrons. They were sewn on the lower right sleeve of a uniform, one chevron per wound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That changed in 1932, when U.S. Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur&nbsp;renamed the old Badge of Military Merit the Purple Heart. <br></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
