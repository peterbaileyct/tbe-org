<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am saddened when I realize that after more than 25 years of writing this letter, there are more people than ever that need our help. We have not come up with a way to ensure that all of our neighbors can access three meals a day of nutritious food. Please help if you can.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your garden is bountiful, see below for where you can donate fresh fruits and vegetables and/or other needed goods. If you don't have a garden, please note that many of our wonderful local social service organizations need other items and gift cards. Some have Amazon wish lists you can order from. They can all use cash donations as well. We are #bristolallheart. If you can, please help. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
