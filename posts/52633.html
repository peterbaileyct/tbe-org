<p>In a rare Sunday afternoon contest, Middletown (7-4-4) edged Bristol Eastern (2-9-4), 1-0.</p>

<p>"In a frustrating season, this was another case of us not generating enough offense," said Bill Sweet, Eastern coach.&nbsp; "Our defense was solid, except for one error, but we aren't getting good looks at opponents' goals."</p>

<p>The lone goal of the game was an own goal inadvertently knocked in by a Lancer back trying to clear the ball at 27:12 of the first period.&nbsp; </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams traded possession over half field, but there were few clear shots throughout the game.&nbsp; &nbsp;Goalie Tyler Hahn for Middletown made just 3 saves and Eastern's Connor Murtaugh had 5.</p>

<p>Eastern ends their season at Bristol Central Tuesday evening in a 7 p.m. game.</p>
