<p>It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Irene LaValley on Aug. 21. Born in Bristol to her late parents, Rosario and Agnes (Comeau) Marion, Mom is predeceased by her late husband Oscar LaValley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mom was a tenacious, fierce woman who advocated for people and causes she believed in. Often stubborn and saying whatever came to her mind. She and Dad collected glass and Amish Items. They often sold things on eBay which kept them both active with technology at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mom’s health declined significantly after Dad’s death in 2017. With diagnosis of mixed dementia, we watched the slow progression of her losing abilities and interests. Mom learned to text and that is how we mostly communicated. I will miss our daily texts, Mom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>We would like to thank our team of caregivers who over the past year allowed Mom to remain at home and feel independent. Thank you, Krista, Eileen, and Erika. Thank you to all the kind, considerate staff at CT Baptist Home who cared for her these last 10 days.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a broken hip sidelined her independence. After her second operation, Mom just could not bounce back. She is now reunited with her late husband, Oscar, and their dog, Teddy. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She is survived by her children, Gary and Nancy LaValley of Wisconsin, Michelle and David Queen or Southington, Conn., her grandchildren, Garett and wife Megan LaValley, Nikolas, and Kaitlyn LaValley all of Wisconsin, her brother Donald and Lynda Marion of Allentown Pa., and her late husband’s cousin Shirley and Donald Walsh of Griswold, Conn.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
