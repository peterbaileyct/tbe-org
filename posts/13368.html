<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Knights open its Connecticut Twilight League campaign on Thursday&nbsp;with an exciting doubleheader from Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game one is an interleague ‘Battle for Bristol’ challenge as teams from the CTL and the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League clash in an exhibition game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest between the GHTBL's Bristol Greeners and the Knights commences at 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the showdown against the Greeners, the Knights regular season opens versus the Connecticut Orioles, the CTL road warriors team comprised mostly of current and past UCONN club baseball and other collegiate players from around the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That second game starts at 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights have been part of the various incarnations of the CTL over the past 20 years and is a staple program of the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol outfit, made of players from town and ESPN over the years, is easily its most recognizable and successful franchise in league history.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We're proud to have been providing a place for local ball players to continue playing at a high level for such a long time,” said Knights co-founder Scott Dickens. “It’s been a few years since we've won a championship but we think the squad this year will be very good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For several years, the Knights have benefitted from the outstanding play of Rick Barrett – the current manager of the crew and a long time Bristol player and contributor on championship squads for both the Knights and Bristol Merchants of the GHTBL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights will return several veterans to the squad, along with a couple new faces, which should make the Bristol program on of the top teams in the CTL in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In league play this season, the Knights join up with Elmer’s Angels, New Britain Rock Cats, Southington Aftershock, Wethersfield Dodgers, Connecticut Orioles and newcomers Enfield Patriots and longtime Connecticut Tri-State Baseball League favorite, the Terryville Black Sox. &nbsp;</p>
