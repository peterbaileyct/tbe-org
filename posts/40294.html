<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – Can the Bristol Central girls basketball team beat crosstown rival Bristol Eastern for a third consecutive time?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That scenario isn’t out of the question as the Rams have broken the hex against their city rival and look to win the first game between the programs this year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central brings some excellent talent to the floor as forward Nicole Riemer has put together a breakout season, hoping to spin some of her hardwood magic against the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team has an established core that could rival Eastern despite the opponent’s excellent record to date (the Lancers are 9-2 overall).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central has some confidence when squaring off against Eastern as a young, hungry group of athletes will be looking to continue its winning streak against the kids from King Street.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what should you expect from Central on Tuesday night when the squad clashes against Eastern?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at the first city series showdown of the year:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central Girls Basketball versus Bristol Eastern, CCC South Confrontation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When</strong>: Tuesday, 6:45 p.m. (stay away snow!)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central (5-5 overall) – Head Coach</strong>: Steve Gaudet&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central’s lineup</strong>:&nbsp;Brooke Watson (senior, injured), forward; Arianna Rivera (senior), guard; Leilani Jackson-Mills (junior), forward; Nicole Riemer (sophomore), forward; Molly McMahon (sophomore), guard; Julia Pikiell (sophomore), guard; Laylani Cespedes (freshmen), guard; Olivia Louis (freshmen), guard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The storyline to consider</strong>: Steve Gaudet’s program is humming as well, hanging in at 5-5 while also turning to some younger players for big time production.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams hope to start their second half of the season playoff push with a victory over the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, there’s a lot riding on the line from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central is looking for its third consecutive win…</strong>Central is on a hot streak against Eastern and getting that victory against Platt – sweeping the season series over the Panthers&nbsp; – might have been exactly what the doctor (or Gaudet) ordered.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this team is hungry, too.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the chance to rope up its fourth victory against the Eastern in five tries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s territory that hasn’t been breached in decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will this be the game in which senior Brooke Watson (8.9 points-per-game in 2023-24, 15 three-pointers) makes her Bristol debut?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting Watson back is in the same conversation as Eastern returning Leah Roy (ACL) to the lineup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both have recovered from their injuries and will be looking to make big splashes over the second half of the regular season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson is a spark plug, looking to finally shake a broken collar bone, and her outside marksmanship has been sorely missed by the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is talented up front with sophomore Nicole Riemer (17.3 points-per-game) controlling the paint.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She gobble up rebounds, rejects a shot or two and will play the entire thirty-two minutes if Gaudet lets her. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Letendre</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riemer&nbsp;is capable of a 25-point point explosion on any given night but she’ll have her hands full whether she's guarding Autumn Udoh or Amanda Noel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central also employs a number of players that can slot over to forward including the slick shooting Leilani Jackson (7.7 points-per-game) or even Arianna Rivera (10.2 ppg).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson is a smooth jumper shooter who can hit from midrange while Rivera is always in motion, finding the passing lanes for steals and lay-ups.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Eastern wants to run up and down the court, that will be more than okay for someone like Rivera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add in the shooting prowess of Molly McMahon and Julia Pikiell – both capable shooters from long range – and Central has the tools to keep pace with Eastern’s offensive weapons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the two players the Lancers must be wary of on the court are freshmen studs Laylani Cespedes and Olivia Louis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two guards are quick, can put the ball in the hoop and are extremely pesky on the defensive end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cespedes averages right around 4.0 points-per-game and the crafty Louis (3.0 ppg) does the dirty work, wearing out opposing guards and is an irritant on the court.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both guards will give Eastern backcourt fits and neither athlete is afraid to mix it up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet better expect the Lancers to press from the start and score in transition off turnovers and miscues.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s been a staple of Eastern’s excellent play to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if Central can remain poised, use the shot clock to its advantage, advance the ball up the court quickly and rebound off Eastern’s first miss – not allowing the Lancers second and third shooting opportunities – then the Rams have half a shot in this city series tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter how this is sliced, the games between the Bristol public school programs, no longer the blowouts like they used to be for nearly a generation, are fun, exciting, unpredictable and worth a trip down to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium to witness in person.</p>
