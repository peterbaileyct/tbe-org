<p>April is Poetry Month, so TBE is including links to poems for those who might be inclined to start their day with an adventure of sorts or who are simply curious. There will be links to classics as well as to some sources that are new. Some will hit home, others will miss.</p>

<p>For an introduction to poetry, there's no one better than Billy Collins and the site he started back when he was U.S. poet laureate, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/poetry-and-literature/poet-laureate/poet-laureate-projects/poetry-180/">Poetry 180</a>. The premise behind Poetry 180 is to provide teachers with 180 poems for each day of the school year. No reason why the rest of us shouldn't take advantage, is there.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list of 180 poems begins with Collins' own "Introduction to Poetry." Click <a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/poetry-and-literature/poet-laureate/poet-laureate-projects/poetry-180/all-poems/item/poetry-180-001/introduction-to-poetry/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those with a few minutes, the <a href="https://onbeing.org/series/poetry-unbound/">Poetry Unbound</a> website hosted by Pádraig Ó Tuama, an Irish poet. He provides commentary along with each poem. Today's selection is Suji Kwock Kim's "Search Engine: Notes from the North Korean-Chinese-Russian Border." </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
