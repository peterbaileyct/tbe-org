<p>BERLIN – The Bristol Eastern boys basketball team could not hold off Berlin on Monday night, falling by a 56-55 final from Berlin High School.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lancers (8-3 overall) had a double-figure lead throughout the first half and into the third quarter play as Eastern’s defense made several stops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I thought we did a good job taking away their offense” in the first half Eastern coach Bunty Ray said. “We were scoring. We were playing great basketball for a half. But there’s two halves in basketball, unfortunately.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leading 21-5 after one period, the Lancers carried a 36-23 edge into the break but were outscored 18-11 in the third quarter, clinging to a 47-41 advantage through three. <br></p>

<p>Eastern lost one of their key members in the second half when Brayden Dauphinais sustained a thumb injury and was unable to return to the game.</p>

<p>Berlin led for the first time off a huge 3-pointer by River Eberhardt (game-high 26 points), giving the Redcoats a 56-53 lead with 32 seconds to play in regulation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Lukas Sward (14 points) answered with two free throws, cutting the deficit to 56-55 with 9.0 seconds remaining.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern eventually fouled Toby Lavender who missed both his free throw attempts and with 6.8 seconds to go, the Lancers had the ball and a chance to win it late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the final attempt didn’t connect at the buzzer as Berlin defeated Eastern by a single point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastern is home this Thursday night against Hartford Public (6:45 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
