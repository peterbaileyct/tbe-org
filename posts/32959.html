<p>Hello, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The calendar claims it’s Thursday, but it feels like a Wednesday. Oh well, let’s get on with it.</p>

<p>Driving Beths Avenue is like driving over rumble sticks because there are problems throughout this road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beths Avenue was built in 1941 and was named for Elizabeth Zigman. Why not call it Elizabeth Zigman Drive? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>June 1949: a married 34-year-old man and the father of two children, went missing. Apparently, he had become stuck in the swampy brush south of Beths and Mt. View avenues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May 1966: the city acquired the land along Beths Avenue to build what would become Mt. View School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>April 1970: over 100 people crowded into City Hall to protest the resumption of an apartment complex being built on the west end of Beths Avenue. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
