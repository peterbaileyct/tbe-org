<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol residents will have several opportunities to receive free COVID-19 vaccines and health screenings throughout the months of April and May.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The free vaccines and screenings are being made available through a partnership between the City of Bristol, the CT State Department of Public Health and Griffin Health. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Griffin Health van will bring the free clinics to three difference locations in Bristol. The free health screenings will include diabetes testing, A1c testing, and blood pressure screenings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those attending the clinic are asked to bring their health insurance card and a photo ID. However, it is not necessary to have health insurance or an ID to receive the vaccine. The clinics are open to the public and no one will be turned away for lack of insurance or ID.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following is a list of locations and times for each of the vaccine clinics:</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
