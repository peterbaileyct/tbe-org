<p>Both the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern wrestling programs were in action at the CIAC championships over the weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams competed in different divisions in 2023, battling all the best programs in Class L and Class M.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams tangled with all the contenders in the Class L bracket and held their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Lancers were involved in the Class M fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended up making a 10th place finish at the Ls, snaring three medals over a tenth-place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams scored 67 points overall and all three of its grapplers will be competing at the State Open event on February 24-25 from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To no one’s surprise at the 138 championships of the Class Ls, Central’s Landon Dionne pushed Killingworth’s Anthony Basile to the brink.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the grappler from Bristol ended up getting pinned in the final seconds of the third period (5:54), earning the runner up finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dionne, rated third in the field, spun Windsor’s Dariuce Wilson via pin 37 seconds in and then in the quarterfinals, he snared an 11-3 major decision victory over Guilford’s Elijah McDermott to make the semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Kaden Dragon (113 pounds), defeated New Milford’s Caden Reynolds by pinfall in only 51 seconds to snare his fifth-place medal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the other fifth place showdown, Central’s Engher Disla almonte (106) was pinned by Simsbury’s Ethan Quinn in 33 seconds to finish in sixth place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier (293½ points) ended up winning the Class L championship with New Milford (second place, 269) and Simsbury (third, 211) not far behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Class M field, Eastern nabbed 43.5 points for 22nd place, making a top-six finish along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s junior standout Adam Zavecz battled his way into the metal round, earning a sixth-place finish off his pin-fall loss to Weston’s Tatum Peiffer (1:51).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Zavecz was ranked sixth in the 182 bracket.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a big pin over Lyman Mem/Windham Tech’s Zach Rebello - earning the victory in just 45 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz, who also came in sixth place at the recent CCC Conference Tournament, earned a pinfall victory against Central four days later to complete a busy regular season slate.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
