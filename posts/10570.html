<p>ROCKY HILL - Bristol Eastern freshman Dante DePass has a bright future for the boys basketball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been making significant gains as of late on the JV level and even earned time playing with the varsity group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Monday night, DePass dropped in a game-high 16 points as the Lancers defeated Rocky Hill by a 63-43 final on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern coach Brett Bisson earned his first JV win as the Kingstreeters turned an eight-point halftime push into a 21-point cushion late in the fourth quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass scored 10 points over fourth period play to make things academic while Jordan Chisholm drained three-second period 3s on his way to 14 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Eastern, Cheniel Serrano-Perez dropped in 10 points, Ben Kozikowski scored six while Brayden Schenck added a three to the till on his way to five points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jahsun Gayle, Dennis Cruz, Caleb Molinsky, Preston Guarda, and Zaveyn Tate all made contributions over the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daniel Lin led the Terriers with 13 points while Grant Fishberg added 12 over the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serrano scored four points over first period play but Rocky Hill secured a 13-12 edge eight minutes into things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern then nailed four three-pointers in the second period as Chisholm’s nine points led the charge - pushing the Lancers to a 28-21 advantage at the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next quarter, Rocky Hill was never able to draw even while Chisholm and DePass netted five points apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with 0.8 seconds to go in the third tilt, DePass put in a shot at the buzzer as Eastern led 41-27 through three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Terriers were then overwhelmed by the Lancers as Serrano canned a free throw, DePass hit a lay-up, and when Tate found Serrano for a conventional three-point play, Eastern held an imposing 47-27 edge with 6:33 remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the game, Kozikowski and Schenck flipped in hoops as Eastern got to the pay window by a 63-43 final, leading to an impressive road victory.</p>
