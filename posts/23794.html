<h3>Bristol’s airport</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once known as Hotchkiss Field, later renamed Stephenson Field (Airport) for Bristol World War I aviator, Lt. Arthur Stephenson, who died in an accident at Caruthers Field in Texas in September of 1918.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1931 the airport had four runways, with the longest being the northwest/southwest strip at 1,950'.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 1945 airport directory states the airport by then had three sod strips, with the longest being the 1,600' north/south strip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 1955, it was relegated to an Emergency Only Airfield.</p>

<h3>If you missed yesterday</h3>

<p>March 5 marked 41 years since actor John Belushi died (1982). He’s been dead longer than he was alive, which is a bit weird for some of the GMB staff.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
