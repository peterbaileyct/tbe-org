<p>I returned a call to Frank Zbikowski, who left a message on my phone the other day. Frank, as many know, is a Bristol fellow that retired from teaching at Har-Bur Middle School in Burlington. He and I were close friends of the late Jimmy Masters, also a teacher at the school.  When I got ahold of Frank, I asked what he has been up to.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pickleball, that’s it,” he replied. “It’s very popular and Bob Wilson runs it (evenings) at the Senior Center."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank added that folks have even played outdoors this winter when the temperatures were 40 degrees and over. That’s in some of the parks in town, and they have organized programs. Call Parks at 860-584-6160 and the Senior Center at 860-584-7895.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Dinoia, Sr.</strong></p>

<p>Paul, 91, called me on the phone last week when he was residing at The Pines. He told me his legs were getting worse and couldn’t get around. I told him I would visit him this week, because he and I both shared a love of local history, and this was before Frank Zbikowski informed me that Paul had just died. Shocking! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul was a good man, just like Ed Pelkey who passed away a week or so earlier. Paul loved sharing bits of history, especially photos, and I ran some in The Bristol Press from time-to-time. Avid about these photos, he gave me almost one per week. My condolences to his family and special friends, Little League, and all.</p>

<p><strong>George Gibb</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I returned home from errands on Monday, I placed myself on the couch and turned on the TV. Horse racing was on, and that reminded me of a fellow from here who once worked as a professional thoroughbred Jockey. That was George Elder Gibb (1935-1969), who is buried at West Cemetery here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started working in stables first, and by 1956 was recognized as one of the up-and-coming jockeys in New England. The following year, he was signed by Hall of Fame trainer Airsch Jacob, and was the champion apprentice at Santa Anita Park in California. Altogether, Gibb captured 1,157 races during his career. He died at a young age, but I’m not sure of what took him.</p>

<p><strong>George Janok (1938 - 2022)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George, who resided here until the age of 12, made a name for himself as somewhat of a celebrity in the entertainment business. He won Primetime Emmy Awards in both 1974 and 1976. He honed skills in placing himself as a jazz drummer, artist. screenwriter, producer of television programs and actor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He died just two years ago in Nashville, and that was from cancer. I wonder if he was aware of another Bristol fellow who performed in Nashville, Elvis impersonator John Beardsley?</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
