<p>It was a very good day for St Paul freshman Dom Napoletano. Making his first Varsity pitching appearance, he came in in relief of Wilson to pitch the top of the 5th. After walking the first batter, he settled down and retired the next 3 Watertown hitters in order striking out 2 of them. Then in the bottom of the frame, Napoletano's first Varsity at bat came with the bases loaded and the score 12-3. Dom stroked an RBI single, and that gave St Paul the walk off win.</p>
