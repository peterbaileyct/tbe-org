<p>Plainville (8-6) used a late goal by Cole Jones to beat visiting Bristol Eastern (2-8-3), 1-0. on their Senior Night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first half had much of the play in the center of the field with Plainville only generating three shots and Eastern one.  Neither side was able to get a good look at the opponent's goal as both defenses stiffened when the ball came over their forty yard line,</p>

<p>"Once again we were able to handle the attack, but we were unable to make a strong run into the final third," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "In the second half, the game opened up and we got the ball in good positions in Plainville's penalty area, but couldn't put a strong foot on it."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones crossed to the top of Lancer penalty area and hit a hard left-footed low shot to into the right corner of the net with 12:50 remaining in the game for the game winner.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had two corner kicks and three crosses into the Plainville penalty area in the final minutes but couldn't capitalize on their chances. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Backs Sam LaMar, Landon Gawel, and Alex Szynal were strong throughout and midfielders Hunter Scott and Eli Emmert initiated our offense," said Sweet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lancer goalie Connor Murtaugh made 5 saves while the Plainville duo of Charlie Hall (1) and Ian Bravado (4) combined for 5 also.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Senior Night is Friday when they host Lewis Mills at 6 p.m. and then they host Middletown in a rare Sunday contest at 1 p.m.</p>
