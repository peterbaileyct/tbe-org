<p>Images of Bristol by residents and visitors from a "Celebrate Bristol" photo contest sponsored by Wheeler Health will be featured in a 2025 Bristol-focused calendar produced by Wheeler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contestants have until July 26 to submit up to three photos each, no larger than 4 MB each, via Wheeler's website. Twelve images will be chosen by a panel of community leaders for the calendar, which will be free as long as supplies last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest coincides with Wheeler's move to its new facility at One Hope Street later this summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What better way to celebrate the beauty, diversity, and richness of this city than to engage the community in capturing and sharing photos for this project,” said Sabrina Trocchi, president and chief executive officer, in the release announcing the contest.</p>

<p>Images will be accepted from digital, cell phone or film cameras.  To submit photos, visit: <a href="http://WheelerHealth.org/PhotoContest">WheelerHealth.org/PhotoContest</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
