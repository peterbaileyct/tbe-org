<p>A new loan fund that encourages businesses outside Bristol to open here and to assist existing businesses in the city is now being offered through a partnership between the city and a nonprofit financing company, according to a release from the city on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="isPasted">The Forgivable Revolving Loan Fund will offer a competitive interest rate, flexible loan terms, and a “forgiveness” component.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="isPasted">Regarding the forgiveness component--if a business makes monthly payments in full and on time to achieve 50 percent loan payback – and continues to conduct business in Bristol for a minimum of 10 years following the loan closing – the remaining 50 percent principal loan balance may be forgiven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="isPasted">The City of Bristol is partnering with the Community Investment Corporation (CIC), a non-profit economic development financing company located in Hamden, to administer the fund.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Funding is available as of Jan. 31. For full program specifics and or to inquire further, visit <a href="https://www.bristolallheart.com/incentives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bristolallheart.com/incentives</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
