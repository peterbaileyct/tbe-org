<p>This past Wednesday, the Connecticut High School Coaches Association released its first Walter Camp Connecticut High School Conference Players of the Week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, frankly, to no real surprise, Bristol Eastern’s own Adam Zavecz made the list for Week 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz is a beast on the field and the player wearing No. 7 for the Lancers program under head coach Anthony Julius is certainly a fun athlete to watch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 6 feet and 195 pounds, Zavecz has a little speed and a ton of ability on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was a 35-14 winner over Farmington this past Saturday and Zavecz, a senior captain on the team, did a little of everything in that Central Connecticut Conference, Tier III challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz was joined by Southington quarterback CJ DiBennedetto for the weekly honor in the CCC.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What didn’t Zavecz do against the River Hawks on Saturday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made a 10-yard reception which was thrown by the returning Kamden Laprise (and then he was robbed of another catch due to a highly questionable block-in-the-back call that nullified his touchdown run).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz collected a team-high 4.5 tackles, including one for a loss of one yard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, he was everywhere on the field where the football went and when he was manning centerfield - and Farmington QB Cayden Markowitz was chucking the ball here, there and everywhere - Zavecz was in motion as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the fourth quarter, when the game was on the line, Zavecz made two of the biggest interceptions of his career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off each pickoff, Zavecz ran the ball back for a touchdown - getting into the goal on two separate occasions - untouched - for huge insurance scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ran interceptions back for 37 and 22 yard scores and now has four career interceptions against Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His touchdowns turned a close 21-14 game with less than three minutes to play, into a 21-point cushion the River Hawks could not overcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congratulations to Zavecz for the Week 1 honor and expect more of the same from the senior standout over the course of the scholastic season.</p>
