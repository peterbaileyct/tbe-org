<p>People forget that Ryan Howse, the former Bristol Central standout in boys hoop, was a tremendous athlete on the hardwood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 1991-1994, Howse led the Rams’ boys basketball program to several big victories and had one heck of a senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of big, that was Howse - 6-foot-8, 230 pounds of talent who caught the eye of the University of Hartford (when they were a NCAA Division I program).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a senior in 1993-94, there weren’t many players in the state better than Howse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He entered the 1994 Class L postseason as the leading scorer in the state, posting amazing averages of 26.1 points and just under a shade of 20.0 rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse was a handful, helped his squad to a 15-6 record as a senior and by the completion of the regular season, Central was ranked just outside the top-10 in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse earned All-State status in Class L as a senior while his buddy on King Street, Todd Ziogas (Pace University), earned the same award in Class LL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was Howse’s game back on February 22, 1994 that turned heads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the night Howse established a new single-game scoring record at BC, notching 45 points - to go along with 25 rebounds - as Central topped Platt by a 60-49 final in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse absolutely crushed it, hitting 15 fields and 15 free throws for his 45 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, no one from that Central team hit a 3 that night as the squad posted 19 field goals and 22 charity tosses to get to its sixty points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Platt was a solid team, falling to 14-5 overall in the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That loss also helped Eastern eventually snare a share of the CCC South Championship along with Platt at 11-3.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse was quite a basketball specimen, able to put the ball in the hoop in just about every way possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Locally, Howse was head-and-shoulders above all the players in Bristol in the scoring department.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the state tournament approached, Howse (26.0 ppg) was averaging over six points more than St. Paul’s Sean O’Brien (19.9 ppg) and Ziogas (19.2 ppg).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse teamed up with the likes of then-junior Billy Ogonowski - a former Bristol Eastern player that saw time as a freshman on the varsity level - and were looking for a big postseason run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That run came to a premature end in the Class L first round when No. 27 Kennedy upset No. 6 Central by a 70-64 final in two overtimes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse led all players with 29 points as the Eagles snuck into tournament play at 8-12 overall, eventually making it to the quarterfinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams played two epic games against the Lancers in 1994, the first being a memorable two overtime war back on February 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ziogas powered Eastern with 28 points - one of his career-high - as Eastern snuck past Central, 68-63.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Howse was tremendous, hitting for 39 points and 29 rebounds that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twenty-four days later, Central got its revenge behind a 61-55 come-from-behind victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that one, Howse busted the Lancers for 29 points and 15 rebounds while freshman Kye Smith hit a lay-up at the third quarter buzzer which helped trim down the deficit to single digits and helped lead to Eastern’s downfall in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Central, Howse played well for Hartford (1994-1998), scoring 1,221 points over his four seasons as his squads won an average of 16 games over his final two collegiate seasons.</p>
