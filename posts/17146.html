<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern boys and girls cross country teams more than held their own in a tri-meet against Plainville and Maloney on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls ended up splitting the day against the competition, hanging a 24-25 loss on the Spartans while falling to the host Blue Devils by an 18-44 final from Hubbard Park in Meriden.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaelyn Gonzalez nabbed fifth place in 23:22 while Lauren Ayotte was eleventh with a time of 25:40.</p>

<p>“Kaelyn Gonzalez ran strong coming in fifth place with a time of 23:22,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “Lauren Ayotte also had a strong day coming in 11th place with a time of 25:40.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers started the season at 1-1 and the program has talented runners in the form of Gonzalez - a freshmen who is going to keep improving - while Ayotte is a multi-sport athlete and one of Eastern’s featured runners.</p>
