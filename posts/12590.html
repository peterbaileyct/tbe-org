<p>Bristol Central baseball coach Bunty Ray simply loves to coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Ray’s 200th victory, which came against Farmington (4-3) last Thursday afternoon, proves that very fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one capacity or another, Ray has been coaching for most of his life and whether it was Pony League or Sandlot Baseball Camp, various clinics he puts on at the Bristol Armory, his time spent as the manager of the Bristol Merchants of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League, and at the public school level in Bristol, he just loves to be on the sidelines - coaching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s exactly the kind of guy who you want teaching your kids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I coach three sports in three different climates and I don’t even understand how statistics work or whatever. I just go in pitch-by-pitch, quarter-by-quarter, and minute-by-minute in soccer,” said Ray. “I just love coaching until my time is up and it’s someone else’s turn. I’m just going to keep on going and I’ll take the good with the bad and the bad with the good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray simply appreciates the process and everything that goes along with mentoring young men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s made so many relationships along the way and his former players and peers respect the veteran coach, some of which have returned to coach alongside him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mitch Rossi, Kelly McCabe, Shawn Mirmina, and Skip Klepps have come along for the ride on the pine at Bristol Central for quite some time now and Ray knows when that crew eventually leaves the scholastic program, they’ll do something else special in the city of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The relationships along the way are really precious to me, even the opponents and opposing coaches,” said Ray. “They raise the bar. My coaches, while I’ll never reach where they are, know that because they’re just more special than anything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lessons learned from mentors like Mike Giovinazzo, Spec Monico, Bob Freimuth, Jim Ziogas and a host of other coaches over a lifetime of playing and coaching baseball is what Ray cherishes the most.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also wants to honor the tradition the men before him have put in place in Bristol - hoping his players pass those values and stories down to their children in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s an ongoing education Ray continues to talk about, teach, and enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Somebody asked me how can you do what you do with all this stuff? Well, how could you not?” said Ray. “I’m gifted in having the ability to be around a lot of great people. You absolutely have to survive some tough days. That’s why I have a great family, a great life and everything else that’s happened. And I’ve got a lot a great mentors I’m able to call. Being able to talk about those things with my mentors is truly great.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All these guys just have so much to still give and I hope someday maybe I said something to as assistant as they move on past me and something gets passed on through them and passed on over time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray is tremendous in what he does and what he continues to bring to the city of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the best is yet to come.</p>
