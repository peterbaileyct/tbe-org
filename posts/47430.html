<p>With the on-going Travelers Championship today, I thought that my main topic here would be the game itself. To start off, and this has nothing to do with the Cromwell course event, my son-in-law, Mark Lombaro, played a round with Steve Phelps this past weekend at Chippanee. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark added that Steve, who is a real estate insurance man and St. Paul boys' basketball coach, parred the sixth hole that day. Mark, though, had a bad day.</p>

<p>Remember Mike Lowrey, a basketball player for Bristol Eastern in the mid 60’s? He had a Bristol-born nephew, John Elliott, who played on the PGA and lesser tours. He’s now a caddy in Florida.</p>

<p>The last time that I played golf -- likely 35 years ago -- I hit a ball into the water in Farmington around the seventh green, put the club through the side of my golf bag, threw it and finished by breaking that seven iron in half. It was then tossed into that man-made body of water never to be seen again! </p>

<p><strong>Like mother, like daughter</strong></p>

<p>Kelly (Kalat) Theriault, a mother and wife as the daughter of Bob and Patti Kalat, was recently announced as “Teacher of the Year” at the Cherry Brook School in Canton. A kindergarten teacher, she is a graduate of Bristol Eastern and is like her mother in doing thoughtful things for others.</p>

<p><strong>Jennie (Bettua) Sileo</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jennie Sileo, the widow of Anthony “Tony” Sileo, passed away here on June 18, just three days shy of her 101st birthday. I got to know Jennie well through her husband and she had the nicest smile. The mother of four with many grand and great-grandchildren, she had a rewarding life as a Bristol native.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe that Bob Bettua, a nephew, was in my high school class. His family ran a successful manufacturing business close by.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol’s all-time boys basketball team</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my opinion, here is Bristol’s all-time boys high school basketball team:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forward Mark Noon, forward Terry Burke, guard Malcolm Huckaby, guard Gary Palladino and center Donovan Clingan. I’m sure others may have some different names, but again, this comes off of my head as I write.</p>

<p><strong>Juneteenth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I may be ahead of the early, early days of Bristol here. However, I want to place the name of Johnie Floyd as one of Bristol’s most beloved individuals. I was lucky to have him as a coach in high school. Richard Jackson was also one of our best.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Top female scholastic basketballers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, I’d start with Laura Lishness from Bristol Eastern, then Kathy Ferrier Delmonte. There’s Chryss Watts and Stacey Porrini Clingan. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
