<p>The  Bristol Boys Co-op lacrosse team hosted Enfield Tuesday night in the CCC South Divisional Semi-final.&nbsp; This was the third time the two teams faced off against each other and for the third time this year the Bristol team came away victorious with a 14-7 result.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While the score represents a significant victory margin, the game was actually a tightly contested affair throughout the first half. The two teams were locked in a 5-5 tie at halftime,&nbsp;a half that was a back-and-forth affair that saw plenty of good defense, goalie play, and some tightness on offense for the Bristol team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole game opened up in the third period.&nbsp; Bristol started putting more and more pressure on Enfield's defense with a barrage of shots that resulted in a 4-0 third quarter, which gave Bristol a 9-5 lead entering the fourth.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jayden Glasper led the Bristol attack with six goals, while&nbsp; Brady Bell was teaching a master-class on finding the open man with five assists.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Bristol offense really zipped the ball around to find the next pass to result in a goal.&nbsp; One of the primary reasons for Bristol's success in the quarter was the way they pursued Enfield's midfield and caused turnovers.&nbsp; The attack ride after a change in possession was also key.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The collective team effort continued in the fourth quarter as Bristol outscored Enfield 5-2.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Aidan Collins found Glasper with a great pass early in the fourth to extend the locals’ lead.&nbsp; For the game, Collins collected three of his own goals to go along with that assist. Chase Dauphinee was also effective with two goals, an assist, and five ground balls.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Defensively, Bristol was led by the trio of Jack Hartley, Connor Ackerly and Hayden Tichy, who collected nine ground balls and were a wall in front of goalie Vinny Howley.&nbsp; Howley successfully stopped 9 of 16 shots he faced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
