<p>UNCASVILLE - The CIAC boys and girls championships came and went this past weekend from the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over the ten games on Saturday and Sunday, a couple competitors were able to pull off tremendous upsets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, some of the results weren’t of any real surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys play, top-rated East Catholic won its third straight championship despite having to battle No. 2 Northwest Catholic in the Division I finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles were able to down the Lions 49-47 as Northwest ended the season as the runner-up for the second consecutive year, this time in Division I.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since beating Plainville for the Class M crown in 1965, East Catholic has taken home eight championships, winning its past three titles by a combined eight points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 St. Bernard, the school of former Sacramento Kings forward Harold Pressley who helped defeat Bristol Eastern at the Class L Finals back in 1981, was able to fend off seventh ranked Staples, 63-50, for the Division II title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third championship for the program, now 3-1 in CIAC finals play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Division III saw the top two remaining squads duke it out as No. 2 Waterbury Career Academy earned a big 74-58 victory over top-rated Bloomfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The championship win was the first ever title in any sport for the school from Waterbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Cromwell and No. 3 Ellington had a good back and forth battle for the Division IV crown with the top seed taking it in the end, 53-46.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cromwell went to the title game for the 17<sup>th</sup> time in school history, winners of three championships since 2009.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the Division V title tilt, it was another No. 1 seed (Windsor Locks) pulling out a 69-58 win over No. 6 Shepaug Valley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory led Locks to its second ever state championship after going 0-4 in title games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving on to the girls championships, two squads that Bristol Eastern battled this season advanced to the finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers split the difference against those two teams this season, going 1-1 against Edwin O. Smith and Northwest Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Class LL finals, another top seeded program won it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Hamden spun No. 2 Fairfield Ludlowe 63-48 – winning its first ever state title game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Class L clash, old friend Edwin O. Smith managed to make it to the state championship showdown, also winning the title for the first time in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third ranked Panthers, defeating Eastern by twenty points in second round play this year, dropped top seeded Pomperaug by a 58-46 final to take home the championship hardware.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one of the two girls title bouts this year in which the No. 1 seed did not qualify for the finals, the Class MM showdown saw No. 6 New London drop No. 4 Mercy by ten points (57-47).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New London is now 3-2 in state title games with all those contests taking place over the past 10 seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the lowest scoring title tilt since 1990, No. 1 East Hampton survived No. 3 Valley Regional by a 31-29 final for the Class M crown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 1990, the Class M championship was won by Northwest Regional, slipping past Ellington, 29-28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win led to the second ever state championship for the Bellringers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in what turned into a battle of middle seeds for the Class S championship, No. 10 Northwest Catholic, a team that lost to Eastern earlier in the year (41-39), defeated No. 16 Kolbe Cathedral, 74-65.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions, who had both its boys and girls teams competing in the finals, was the lowest seed to win a title this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
