<p>TORRINGTON - The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball squad never seems to have an easy time of it against Torrington in Zone 1 battles over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Saturday’s game between the squads was as wacky as they come. The teams combining for 15 runs and several walks but Post 2 grabbed an 8-7 victory over Post 38 from Fuessenich Park in Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The triumph moved Bristol to 7-5 in Zone 1 play and 7-6 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 38 fell to 3-9 overall and has yet to win a game from home this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight pitchers were used over seven innings of on the diamond warfare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 used a plethora of pitchers - four in all - as Bristol has a twin bill on Sunday, meaning arms were in short supply for the Torrington showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Tyler Martin (6 IP, 3 ER, 4 Ks), Jaydon Churchill, Elliot Norris, and Dylan Woodsome (0.2 IP, K) combined their efforts to pull out the eventual win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin scooped up his first victory of the season, Churchill and Norris held the fort, while Woodsome earned the save as Bristol held off a great effort by Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fourth pitcher of the outing for Post 38, Jacob Groebel, drew the loss for the home team (1.1 IP, 2 ER).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, all eight of the runs Torrington allowed were earned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, just four of seven runs Bristol allowed were of the earned variety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home team left runners on base everywhere to the tune of a dozen as that one big hit never materialized at the right time for Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol generated nine hits that afternoon as Churchill tallied a third of those (3-of-4, two runs, RBI).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette went 2-of-3 with a double, a run scored, and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Osuch roped up two hits (2-for-4) and scored two runs, Tyler Stickels (1-for-2, double, two walks, RBI) also had a good day while Martin (1-for-3, run, RBI) helped out his own cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron and Martin each nabbed RBIs via sacrifice flies while Fradette, Woodsome, and Stickels all stole bases for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This game could have gone either way but thanks to two Bristol runs in the top of the seventh, Post 2 secured an 8-6 lead as Martin had thrown 104 pitches - reaching the pitch count and made way for the other three Bristol pitchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But four combined walks allowed a run to score - trimming the Bristol lead to 8-7 - before Woodsome shut the door on Torrington for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was crazy throughout as Torrington led 1-0 through one before Bristol nabbed a 3-1 push over its portion of the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 38 regained the edge in the bottom of the third, scooping up a 4-3 lead through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, Bristol dropped in three runs in the top of the fifth to secure a 6-4 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Post 38 scored twice in the sixth to tie things up at 6-6 before seventh inning heroics sealed the win for Post 2.</p>
