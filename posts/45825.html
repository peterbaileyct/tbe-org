<p>The 2024-2025 city budget will come before a Joint Budget meeting of the City Council and Board of Finance in the council chambers in city hall at 5:30 p.m. this evening.</p>

<p>The proposed budget for the coming year is $229,065,085, which amounts to a 2.79 percent increase over last year. </p>

<p>An increase in the mill rate from 30.35 to 31.85 mills for real estate and personal property and to 32.46 mills for motor vehicles is also being proposed. For a single family, the tax increase this year would average 5 percent taking into consideration both real estate and personal property along with motor vehicles.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
