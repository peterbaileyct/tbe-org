<p>BRISTOL - Thank goodness the regular season is coming to a close in Connecticut American Legion baseball this week because the Bristol Senior program is simply out of pitching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through injuries and pitch counts, the roster is depleted with just one left remaining game in regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol squares off against Simsbury (6-9) tonight from Muzzy Field in Bristol (5:30 p.m.) in a Zone 1 attraction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 (9-6 Zone 1) is treating the game like a must-win with the playoffs starting on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A win could see the locals earn a home game against Enfield at Muzzy this weekend so the stakes are extremely high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a stellar four inning victory over Meriden on Sunday, Dylan Woodsome (1-0) will be pressed into duty, in a starting role this time, looking for his second win of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Backing him up will be Jayden Churchill who saw a little action on the hill in the previous day’s 12-2 mercy ruled shortened loss against West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 10 run defeat was partially due to Bristol running out of arms at the worst possible time. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I had to save Woody for Wednesday and Jayden wasn’t going more than 30” pitches against West Hartford said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “That was just trying to get Jayden a feel. I thought he did a little better. He threw some strikes because his last outing [at Torrington], he didn’t throw too many strikes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He hasn’t pitched a ton either.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of that Torrington game from last Saturday, Woodsome earned the save over a 0.2 inning effort – throwing just 18 pitches – and the following day in game one against Meriden, the chucker needed just 30 pitches to snare a huge 10-7 win out of the bullpen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And his arm is warmed up and ready to go against a better-than-advertised Simsbury squad later today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>West Hartford saw a Bristol ace only once this season</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the pitching rotation came around for the West Hartford games this season, only once did the top ranked American Legion baseball squad (15-0 Zone 1) see one of Bristol’s best pitchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, June 13, Matt Beaucar threw 5.2 innings of 108 pitch ball as Post 96 wrangled up a 5-0 win from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before Beaucar left the mound, Bristol was still hanging around in that contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Post 96 program never faced Roberto Cruz (4-0) which would have been a real test for Zone 1’s top team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“West Hartford is a good team but I haven’t pitched our best pitchers against them just because I want to get wins and I don’t want to waste our best pitching on the best team in our zone,” said LaPenta. “[Plus], we’ve already locked up second place.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal is to win the final game of the regular season against Simsbury, looking to take the season series from the squad and gain some momentum for a postseason push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time the team’s squared off on July 5, Post 2 pulled out a 6-3 win on the road and the team is looking for a similar result on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tomorrow we have Woody and Jayden and I think if we get the win [against Simsbury], we get a home game on Saturday,” said LaPenta. “We’ll be four games back over .500 if we win tomorrow.” </p>
