<p>Construction is underway at the five-acre Seymour Park on Shrub Road. Recently, heavy equipment began clearing the land to make improvements to the basketball court and converting the tennis court into pickleball courts with netting and fencing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Park superintendent Dr. Joshua Medeiros anticipates the new construction and concrete pouring portion of the project to be completed by the end of 2022 with the painting and relining of the courts done in March or April, when the weather improves. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We will release more detailed opening dates as we get closer and know more. This will include a grand re-opening celebration and ribbon cutting event,” Medeiros said.</p>

<p>Renovations and enhancements are also being made to Kern Park, Stocks/Casey Field, a re-launch of the Pine Lake Adventure Park with new amenities, and additional fitness equipment at Rockwell Park. This is in addition to the large undertaking at Page Park.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a golden time for the Bristol parks system and Medeiros said the 2020 City Wide Parks Master Plan was instrumental in bringing these projects to fruition, “It provided a foundation and a roadmap.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medeiros is excited about bringing these improvements and enhancements to the residents of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These projects are essential to creating vibrant public spaces for people to enjoy; work on their physical and mental health, build community with friends and neighbors, and ultimately be proud to live in the City of Bristol," said Medeiros.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those wanting to learn more about park projects, the Park Department team created an interactive Portal. Residents can view active, past and upcoming projects as well as see design and coast information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The portal is available at <a href="http://www.bristolrec.com">www.bristolrec.com</a> and it will be updating on a regular basis. Visitors to the portal can submit their comments and ideas.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
