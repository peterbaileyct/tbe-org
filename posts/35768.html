<p>One of the tidbits of information gleaned from Tuesday's launch of Connecticut's new arts and tourism campaign, including a brand-new logo, is that the number of makers now operating out of Bristol Bazaar has risen to 58 from the original 26 when it opened in July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I love that we can be a part of something that's bigger," said Care Verikas, one of the owners of the bazaar with her husband, Eric, about the new marketing campaign. "Like the makers world, everybody is in it together, you are a family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"All 56, 58, of our makers," she added in her concluding remarks, underscoring the popularity of the new space among makers and trying to keep up with its growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are all in this together, we are supporting each other and being able to use that logo and put our spin on it as a small business owner, shows that you are all part of it and you are all doing it together," she said, keeping the focus on the state's campaign, and the spirit that underscores that can-do spirit of both the bazaar and Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The launch at the Bristol Bazaar, a maker space and retail outlet, brought Gov. Ned Lamont and his marketing team, along with several other entrepreneurs from across the state who exemplify that spirit, to kick off the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new logo, part of a million-dollar investment by the state to rebrand its "Still Revolutionary" campaign, will be made available to small businesses to incorporate into their own marketing campaign. Its slogan is "Make It Here."</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was the Verikases and their vision, one that the state hopes to encourage others to follow through its marketing message, that held center stage when they recounted their story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> "There's maker spaces. There's craft fairs and shows, but really nothing year-round that helped people grow their business," Care said after visiting the western United States pre-pandemic where they first encountered these types of space and began discussing possibilities with each and coming up with their own approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two had just transitioned to running their own business, in 2017, a side hustle, as she recalled, that became so successful, Erik could leave his job and work full-time. Erik trained as an architectural woodworker. Care has a background in marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The side hustle, making corn-hole sets, had begun as a fun thing to do. With its success the couple still were bubbling with ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We had a lot of coffee conversations on Sundays, many with what if's and how do we do this," she said, which led them to the Central Connecticut Chambers of Commerce, the State Department of Economic and Community Development and SCORE, and eventually conversations with the city, which was entertaining applications for Bristol's portion of American Rescue Plan funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They received a $235,000 grant which allowed them to develop the space off Race Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I had never done anything like that before, but we did," she said about process of acquiring funding, which is part of the experience that they have incorporated into their vision--assisting other makers to become small business entrepreneurs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eric said assisting others to follow suit is one of their goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We want to be able to provide for the other makers here who are moving away from their full-time job," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This includes finding funding sources and other support for that life transition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two grew up here, but moved away, returning to the place they now call home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I don't really see us going anywhere else," Erik said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Anthony, the state's chief marketing officer, said, "Bristol Bazaar is the intersection of creativity and innovation and entrepreneurship. It is doing something that is not only making money, but it is also making others money and opportunity."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added that "This story here is emblematic of who we are as a state as a community of creatives--you have the state who provided AARP money to the municipality, and the municipality who give this to private creators and now they are employing and highlighting another 58. That is incredible."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony presented the marketing campaign and invited speakers to the podium, while interjecting points about the rebranding and Connecticut's hopes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano said, "This unique makers' marketplace fits the transformational nature of what we were looking for."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added that the bazaar allows people to sell their wares in a brick-and-mortar building, which is something that has been disappearing, but is also something that people miss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The state's new 'Make It Here' campaign and flexible branding, is actually pretty cool for us.  It's going allow us to market our growing entertainment zone, it might help us market our arts and culture tourism district, which I think we are one of five in the state, and it's also going to help local businesses and manufacturers to brand their different pieces."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He thanked the Verikases for their vision to build a little Las Vegas here in Bristol, as he said he calls the bazaar, and for giving 58 makers the opportunity to grow, as well as to provide an incubator space for potential future businesses.</p>

<p>He called Variases' a great collaboration and that he was excited for Bristol to be chosen as the site of the launch of the rebranding campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut Teacher of the Year Carolyn Kielma, who is now at Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School, focused her comments on the state as a great place to get an education but also to live, with so many opportunities from recreation to entertainment, being close to the shore and forests, being between Boston and New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was here in Connecticut that I became the educator I am today," she said, "by learning from the best of the best--in New Haven, West Haven, New Britain and Bristol, where I still work."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his statements, the governor quipped that he was spending a lot of time in Bristol because there is so much going on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bristol Bazaar, this is so cool," Lamont said. "It is made in Connecticut. Why don't you buy it right here in Connecticut. Buy it right here, help out all the local startups that are happening in Bristol and around the state. I think that is what this message is all about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"And this energy, this place is so amazing, come visit," he said. "You'll love it."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He promoted Connecticut for is entrepreneurial spirit, its quality of life, its schools and location, which is the core of the new marketing message.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
