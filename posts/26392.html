<p>BRISTOL – Senior night was a complete success for the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team on Tuesday evening as the Lancers held on for a big 10-9 victory over Wethersfield in a CCC South encounter from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to sweep the season series over the Eagles though both matches nearly went down to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first match between the programs on April 21, Eastern came away with a huge 11-9 win despite a very physical encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rematch, the Kingstreeters improved to 11-4 overall – winners of three straight matches with two road challenges left on the docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern seniors Sarah Hartley, Lilli Lowe, Avery Ellis, Abby Giles, Maddie Carros, Carolyn Wilson, Taigan Parent and Kenzie Aparo all enjoyed one last victory from Alumni Field during regular season competition, staving off an aggressive Eagles’ attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to secure a late one-goal edge and held off Wethersfield over the final four minutes of regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match wasn’t for the faint of heart as both teams were aggressive over a very competitive bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Emma Stavens scratched and clawed for six goals while Vanessa Drury added a hat trick along with two assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aparo also tallied a goal while Hartley nabbed an assist to pace the Eastern attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayna Hatcher and Wilson were once again clutch on the defensive end, scooping up several ground balls while putting extra pressure on the Wethersfield offenders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those double teams made a lasting impact on the match because late in the fray, the Eagles were on the move – looking to tie things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the visiting aggression was never able to draw even in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late miscue by the Kingstreeters gave Wethersfield late shots at the Eastern goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avery, the outstanding Eastern keeper, was able to make three game-saving stops to keep the tying goal out of the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Stavens, Drury, Aparo and Hartley played keep away, eventually running out the clock.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game saw its share of fouls as the Eagles were whistled for three yellow cards to keep the program from tallying double figures in scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dropped balls and dangerous plays couldn’t stop the Lancers from winning their third straight match with a couple big games left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final two before the postseason</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday night at 7 p.m., Eastern squares off against Bristol Central in a CCC South showcase from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the following night, to end the regular season, Eastern is on the road against Rockville – Mr. Stavens old stomping grounds – at 4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>History making win</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory against Wethersfield propelled Eastern to its 11th victory this year, the most wins by the program in a single season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That historic triumph also gives the Kingstreeters a real shot at the CCC Tournament after the completion of regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And anytime your team can participate in a conference tournament, the match – or matches – become excellent state tournament tests with house money to spare.</p>
