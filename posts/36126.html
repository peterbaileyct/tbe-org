<p>A Bristol resident since 1966, she worked for the Roland Dumont Agency for over 33 years before retiring. A social person, Dolly was a member of many clubs over the years, including the Junior Women’s Club, OSIA, the Ladies Guild and the Rosary Society. Her faith was important to her, watching daily mass when she was no longer able to attend in person. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
