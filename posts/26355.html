<p>WILLIMANTIC - The Bristol lacrosse coop scored another tremendous victory over the program from Edwin O. Smith on Monday afternoon as the locals came away with a big 11-6 triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was contested from the beautiful lacrosse field on the campus of Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all the stars from Bristol came out to compete - and win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters moved to 11-2 overall with just three matches remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith fell to 5-8 as it struggled to catch up against the CCC South foe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a true team effort as six of the 11 Bristol goals were assisted upon as slick ball movement was able to foil the Panthers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match could have fallen off the rails if the defense hadn’t have made stop after stop while a few fouls couldn’t slow down Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit goalie Max Stavens who tallied 20 big saves on the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Bristol defense was frustrating Smith offenders, it was the Kingstreeters’s slick scoring sets that led to the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian Reardon once again led the offensive charge with four goals while Jayden Glasper (two goals, two assists) and Dylan Brown (two goals, one assist) scored multiple times for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vinny Howley, Brady Bell and RJ Fellows all scored goals over the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bell also chipped in with a game-high three assists while Chase Dauphinee and Howley each tallied four ground balls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braydan Dwyer, Brown (not Austin) and Reardon all scooped up three ground balls to help Bristol win once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The schedule doesn’t relent much with the Bristol program looking to continue to win as many matches as possible with the postseason looming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, the local coop squares off against Danbury in a match from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time commences at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Saturday, the Kingstreeters battle South Windsor in Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another bout from Alumni Field, Bristol’s showdown against the Bobcats commences at 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, May 22, the Bristol coop squad finishes the regular season on the road.</p>
