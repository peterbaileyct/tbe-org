<p>BRISTOL - The loss of Julius Powell, Bristol Central’s senior center on the boys basketball team, will certainly hurt the depth of the squad this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that young man certainly deserves a better fate after all the hard work he put into the program over the past three seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams understood that the middle belonged to Powell and he would have put together some tremendous nights as one – if not the – of the tallest players in the CCC South.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, with Powell in the mix, was thinking more than just eight wins this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think if Julius was around, we had some goals that were higher than eight wins,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “Obviously, losing Julius is going to make that a little more difficult.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell showed his skill in small bunches last season, usually when 7-foot-2 big man Donovan Clingan got into a little foul trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was an eight-point explosion against East Catholic over the Rams’ second game last season – helping Central keep and even extend its lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played important minutes at the Springfield Central game and was more than just a mop-up center at the end of games during his junior campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell averaged around 2.4 points-per-game but he was certainly more valuable than just a hoop or two every night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played excellent positional defense and knew where to be on the court.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell stayed out of the way of the senior scorers, helping snare a few rebounds to start the break or give the Rams another possession on that championship squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was going to be his turn and Powell would have cleaned up at center for the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He would have been All-Conference,” predicted Barrette of Powell. “He was a walking double-double.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, just like when he was laid up in football, Powell will be there – on and around the bench and at practice – pumping his teammates up and giving invaluable advice during games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s what a true senior leader brings to any successful team, injured or not.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell will help the team build chemistry and he still has plenty of work to do for the defending champs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
