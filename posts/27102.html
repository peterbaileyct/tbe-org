<p>For six innings in West Haven Monday night, Bristol Central's Sophia Torreso and Jonathan Law's Madyson Bull were engaged in a tense pitcher's duel, as neither team ever really came close to scoring the first run of the game. But in the top of the seventh inning, the Lawmen broke through for two huge runs, and the Rams had no answer in the bottom of the frame, so Central took the long bus ride home frustrated in their quest for a state championship trophy.</p>

<p>Torreso was magnificent all evening, allowing only five hits in the game, three of which were swinging bunts. But Jonathan Law's Bull was even better, never even allowing a runner to reach third base for the entire contest, and topping off her performance with the game-winning hit in the top of the seventh.</p>

<p>Torreso struck out eight and walked only two batters the entire night, but one of those free passes occurred with one out in the fateful seventh inning. Law's seventh hitter, Talia Salanto, was the recipient of that walk, and it seemed innocent enough, as the eight and nine hitters were to follow. But Grace Hess followed the walk to Salanto with a perfectly placed nubbed ground ball that hugged the third base line and went for a very chintzy base hit. The number nine hitter popped up a bunt to BC third baseman Tori Hogan, and Torreso was one out away from preserving her shutout. </p>

<p>Bull came to the plate and proceeded to line a sharp single to center field with Salanto crossing the plate with what turned out to be the only run Jonathan Law needed. The next batter, Elizabeth Roos, placed a weak ground ball just to the right of Central first baseman Adriannna Lubrico, and no play could be made anywhere, so the bases were now loaded for Law. A passed ball resulted in Hess crossing the plate with the second run, before the third out resulted from a pop-up to second. Basically, Jonathan Law scored two runs with only one ball reaching the outfield.</p>

<p>The task now was a daunting one for Central, as Bull was getting stronger as the game progressed. The bottom of the seventh started with two BC strikeouts, which brought Central's Kaley Laird to the plate with one out remaining for the Rams. Laird, showing her usual grit, laced the hardest hit ball for Central all night, but unfortunately for the Rams, her laser to center field went directly into the glove of Law's Paige Jolley, and suddenly the Central season was over.</p>

<p>Bull was truly dominant all evening, giving up two hits while striking out thirteen Central hitters and walking four. The Rams had two runners on in both the second and third, but Bull stepped it up and ended each frame with a big K. And after the third, no Central runner even reached second base.</p>
