<p>It was good to see your article regarding the abundant litter of our city. Since COVID my wife and I stopped our gym visits and began daily walks. On our walks we were disturbed by the large amounts of litter strewn about. So, on each walk we began picking up the streets in our neighborhood in the northeast section.</p>

<p>Sadly, each day litter is discarded and each day we long to see enforcement of anti-littering laws, but alas there are no reports of arrests.</p>

<p>If local government truly cared those in office would seek volunteers, provide gloves, grabbers, trash bags and neon shirts emblazoned with PLEASE DON’T LITTER! That would likely draw more attention to this serious problem and get better results than some photo op by a councilmember who is supposedly upset about the condition of our streets.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
