<p>When Jeff Caggiano became Bristol’s mayor in November 2021, he felt spending and fiscal responsibility were priorities, and that opinion has not changed in 15 months. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are literally trying to keep spending under control and will have a relatively flat budget,” he shared with the TBE Wednesday at a noisy and festive Pint and Plate following his election announcement.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are going through the budget process right now, and we will be fiscally conservative to make sure we keep the things that are going, going, while bringing in outside development.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While acknowledging he did inherit some projects from the previous administration, like Wheeler Clinic, he feels he has improved them. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of my campaign themes is we are going from signs to shovels downtown. I want to show people that we are getting things done so they can see the fruits of our labor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While “shovels in the dirt” and commercial development downtown are making headlines, the area he is most proud of and provides great satisfaction is the team assembled around him, and the leadership displayed at city hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leadership at city hall is the thing I am most proud of. We have many people working very well together. Department heads are leading, things are getting done. We are working as a cohesive team to make sure all these projects and economic development is happening,” Caggiano observed. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am very proud of how our council has come together and will continue to come together to finish what we started.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The election for mayor and city council is in eight months.</p>
