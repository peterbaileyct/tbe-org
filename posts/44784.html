<p>Aiden Bisaillon tossed a 1-hitter and led the Holy Cross Crusaders to a 2-0 win over the St. Paul Falcons in Bristol yesterday afternoon at St. Paul Catholic High School.</p>

<p>Bisaillon struck out 10 while walking none and didn't allow a single baserunner to reach third base safely. Logan Rembish was the hard luck loser for St. Paul. Rembish tossed a 4-hitter allowing only 1 earned run and also struck out 10.</p>

<p>For Holy Cross, Eli Wall led off the game with a single to right. Wall stole second to move into scoring position, and then scored on an infield error to give Holy Cross the early 1-0 lead.</p>

<p>The score remained 1-0 until the top of the sixth. With one out, Gavin Perrone walked. A single by Ryan Makowski moved Perrone over, and a single by Carsten Donovan drove Perrone in to make it 2-0. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
