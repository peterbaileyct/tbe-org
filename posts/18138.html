<p>Two weeks ago, The Bristol Edition contacted all the candidates for state office and asked them to submit a short biography and a discussion of what they consider to be the three biggest issues in this year’s election. Here are the submissions we received.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Biography</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greg grew&nbsp;up in the Sherman Park section of Bristol&nbsp;and&nbsp;met his wife&nbsp;(Sue)&nbsp;of 38 years at Eastern High School. &nbsp;They&nbsp;have two adult children, both married and one wonderful and precocious grandchild.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greg has worked in Information Technology for over 30 years having owned and operated a consulting company for 11 of those years. &nbsp;He currently works in the Treasury IT area of&nbsp;a large insurance company&nbsp;as Program Manager/RTE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was president of the Bristol Brass and Wind Ensemble and has been an active member for 15 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greg was elected to Bristol’s City council for two highly productive terms. &nbsp;As City Councilman, Greg, and the mayor, created the City Arts and Culture Commission. &nbsp;He was then appointed City Council liaison to the commission for his four years in office&nbsp;also&nbsp;served on Public Works, Ordinance Committee, and Real Estate Committee among others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Issues</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was asked to run for State Senate, I first wanted to check the record of our current senator. &nbsp;I found there were&nbsp;significant gaps&nbsp;with&nbsp;how the 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;District was being represented. &nbsp;Our senator&nbsp;is putting&nbsp;the priorities of the Republican Party above the interests of his constituents&nbsp;and only voting party line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I chose to run to be a loud voice protecting women’s reproductive rights in&nbsp;the State of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seventy percent of CT adults feel that we must protect women’s reproductive rights and my opponent has voted against reproductive freedom and the right to choose consistently over his 8 years in office. &nbsp;This may not have felt like a threat&nbsp;in past elections but now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, make no mistake, Republicans will overturn our laws if given the opportunity. &nbsp;I will support a bill to make a CT Constitutional Amendment to guarantee women’s reproductive freedom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact that our blue-collar community has no representation in the current senator is another reason that I chose to run. &nbsp;I will be their voice in Hartford as State Senator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 31st District is a blue-collar district and yet our current senator ignores the issue of working families and refuses to speak with union representatives. &nbsp;A good example is the closing of Associated Spring in Bristol. It was announced 3 months&nbsp;ago,and our legislators have never reached out to the union to see what can be done for these workers that will soon be&nbsp;losing their jobs&nbsp;not to mention how this will affect&nbsp;our&nbsp;community. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a side note, I met with the senior leadership of the UAW and AFL-CIO to hear their concerns. &nbsp;I then contacted Ned Lamont and&nbsp;through these efforts&nbsp;we now have&nbsp;a&nbsp;contact in Hartford&nbsp;to assist&nbsp;those affected by the closing of Associated Spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to create solutions facing our state and community. &nbsp;Currently, our senate representation&nbsp;votes no without providing any&nbsp;solution to the issues we are facing.&nbsp;He just votes “NO”. &nbsp;If you simply vote “’No” without an alternative solution, you are a big part of the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I chose to run because we need solutions for the issues facing the state. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am a life-long Bristol&nbsp;resident&nbsp;raising my family of three children with my husband, Ken.&nbsp;I am hard-working, family-oriented and dedicated to using my experiences to represent&nbsp;my constituents&nbsp;in the State&nbsp;Legislature.&nbsp;My&nbsp;background in retail and manufacturing management along with my experience as a local Realtor&nbsp;help&nbsp;me&nbsp;understand the needs of the people. I serve on the Economic and Community Development Board for Bristol since being appointed in December 2019.&nbsp;I attended Bristol Public Schools, received my Bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management from Post University and I am currently attending Quinnipiac University for my MBA. I understand the challenges of working full-time, raising a family and pursuing a degree.&nbsp;My goal&nbsp;when elected&nbsp;is to bring forward the concerns of the community and bring a fresh perspective that aligns with the best interests of all&nbsp;my&nbsp;constituents, all while taking a bipartisan stance on issues.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Issues</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women's Reproductive Rights&nbsp;– We need to ensure that women’s rights are protected permanently.&nbsp;If the wrong people are elected, Democrats could lose control of the State which could cause the current protections to be revoked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Inflation reduction&nbsp;– It’s no secret that inflation is at an all-time high. When elected, I will work with my colleagues in the Legislature to reduce the impact of inflation on those that need it most.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>•&nbsp;Educational Funding&nbsp;– Currently, the&nbsp;Educational Cost Sharing (ECS) grant program&nbsp;is not enough to provide funds for our students.&nbsp;We need to ensure the education of our youth, our future, is preserved.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Biography</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary Fortier,&nbsp;born and raised in Bristol, served on the City Council from&nbsp;2013-2021.&nbsp;She&nbsp;earned a BA in History and Secondary Education from Boston College. Mary graduated from WNEC School of Law in 1995. She currently works for the State of CT Judicial Branch. &nbsp;Mary represents her union at the Greater Bristol Labor Federation.&nbsp;Together with her husband David,&nbsp;Mary is the proud mother to six children and grandmother to three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​As a Council member, she has served on&nbsp;many&nbsp;different committees, including Salary, Public Works, Water and Sewer, and Economic and Community&nbsp;Development.&nbsp;Throughout her tenure&nbsp;she&nbsp;served on the Disability&nbsp;Commission, to which she brings a unique perspective and enthusiasm—both of her siblings are&nbsp;disabled. &nbsp;Throughout her tenure, she&nbsp;sat on&nbsp;the&nbsp;board of&nbsp;Bristol Community Organization, and later Human Resources Agency of New Britain. Mary now serves as President of the board&nbsp;of HRA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>​​​​​​Issues</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By far, the number one&nbsp;election issue for 2022 is inflation. The price of gasoline has been particularly effected,&nbsp;which impacts the local gas pump, but in turn effects all other goods and services&nbsp;dependent on gas for production and shipment.&nbsp;In CT our governor has suspended our gas tax temporarily. Along with releasing supply from our strategic&nbsp;reserves and other measures our federal government&nbsp;has taken, we have gotten some relief in the price of gas. &nbsp;The&nbsp;ripple effects continue, so there continues to be work to do to relieve the stress inflation is causing, especially for residents with low or fixed incomes. Again, our governor added an additional&nbsp;child&nbsp;tax credit&nbsp;to help lessen the effects of inflation. &nbsp;I would support measures that expand the LIHEAP program&nbsp;(heating assistance), support childcare subsides and childcare workers&nbsp;and&nbsp;workforce&nbsp;development.&nbsp;I would call all these items, economic infrastructure for families, the basic building&nbsp;blocks they need to survive and thrive. &nbsp;For seniors, the cost&nbsp;of prescription drugs, can be an economic stressor even without inflation. So, we must seek&nbsp;long term solutions to bringing&nbsp;down and stabilizing the cost of prescription&nbsp;drugs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>​That leads me to my second priority, healthcare. I consider healthcare a basic human right. In CT we do a better job than many states providing affordable healthcare&nbsp;options, but we still have uninsured residents&nbsp;and residents with&nbsp;inadequate coverage that could result in significant financial hardship if there&nbsp;was a&nbsp;serious illness or accident,&nbsp;and seniors unable to afford their medication.&nbsp;In&nbsp;a state with wide economic disparities prior to COVID,&nbsp;and prior to our current inflation, healthcare disparities make those economic disparities&nbsp;wider.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want CT to be a leader in&nbsp;providing the best healthcare, the most comprehensive healthcare and the most affordable healthcare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CT is a leader in women’s reproductive&nbsp;rights, but there is no guarantee&nbsp;it will remain&nbsp;that way. &nbsp;Women’s reproductive rights are part of healthcare, but this year, a separate issue of focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court Dobbs decision, overturning Roe v Wade this spring has changed&nbsp;the world as we know it.&nbsp;Woman’s reproductive decisions should be made in consultation with her doctor. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some states&nbsp;have been pushing the boundaries of Roe for years, but the restrictions passed recently&nbsp;are extreme and include, in many cases, no exceptions&nbsp;for danger to the mother’s health, or rape, or incest. I heard a radio story about a college clinic being told not to discuss or offer birth control, so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;jeopardize their standing&nbsp;under these&nbsp;new state&nbsp;laws. &nbsp;Other stories describe women with serious difficulties&nbsp;such as tubal pregnancies, which will not survive,&nbsp;having to wait for surgery until they were dangerously close to death.&nbsp;I know in&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;states, women will die, and poor woman will have increased hardships due to these extreme&nbsp;laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that&nbsp;Purple&nbsp;states, such as Wisconsin and Ohio, have enacted these bans. &nbsp;In CT we have been lucky, but we are&nbsp;a Republican Governor, or Republican majority in our legislature away from being a&nbsp;Purple&nbsp;state.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will support and advocate for these and other issues&nbsp;to protect and improve the lives of the residents of the 79<sup>th</sup>.</p>
