<p>BRISTOL - The Berlin High School football program is a formidable opponent for any of the squads from the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Thursday evening, the Redcoats invaded Bristol Central - securing a 27-0 CCC Tier II victory from the turf field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin moved to 4-1 overall while Central fell to 1-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams allowed 21 first half points while the defense stepped up over the final 24 minutes of play, yielding just six points the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s defense made stops but once the Berlin squad zipped up an early edge - via a three-yard touchdown run by Ryan Lavender with 4:49 to play in the first period - the home team was never able to draw even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central quarterback Jack Hartley rumbled up 28 yards on the ground over 17 rushing attempts while connecting on 4-of-9 passes for 19 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper led the squad in rushing yards with 49 yards on 10 attempts while Aidan Lamarre, Tristian Toussaint and Cassias Breland all made carries for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breland caught three of Hartley’s four passes for those 19 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats outgained the Rams 333-107 yards overall as Berlin’s defense zipped up a shutout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin QB Christian Riccitelli hit 11 of 16 passes for 126 yards and a couple touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was still just a one possession game midway through the second stanza before Riccitelli found Jon Jon Morales for a 37-yard TD reception and then to end the half, the quarterback was at it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Morales caught an 11 pass from Riccitelli at the halftime buzzer as Central trailed 21-0 going into the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams and Redcoats did not score in the third tilt and a late score from Berlin - a one-yard plunge by Elijah Santos - ended the showdown as the visiting aggression rumbled up a 27-0 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weekend, Central is enjoying the bye week - ready and willing to improve from its 1-4 ledger at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On October 20, the Rams are back at it when the program tees off against Manchester on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown commences at 6 p.m. next Friday.</p>
