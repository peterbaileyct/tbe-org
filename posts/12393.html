<p>BRISTOL - After a couple tough games to start the scholastic campaign, the Bristol Eastern softball team finally got to the pay window - collecting in a big way on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers smashed Windsor by a 12-3 final from the softball field on King Street in a CCC Interdivisional tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first victory of the campaign for the program at Eastern, moving to 1-2 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor (2-1) fell for the first time after averaging 18 runs-per-game over its first two contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After just posting four runs over its first two games, the offense exploded for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez and Alex Shorette zipped up back-to-back home runs to pace the Eastern offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But those two offensive standouts weren’t the only ones to square up a long ball that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Policki smashed out a homer and Ali Tellier dropped in a three-run blast as Eastern beat the Warriors by nine runs.</p>

<p><strong>The Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have two home games to end the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern welcomes CCC South challenger Lewis Mills to King Street on Tuesday at 3:45 p.m. and then on Friday, non-conference invader Pomperaug travels to Bristol for a big bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 4:15 p.m. </p>
