<p>Bristol residents are hosting a benefit this holiday season to make a special Christmas wish for 8-year-old Rylee Brooks come true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rylee, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 anaplastic ependymoma when she was just 2 years old, has spent most of her young life fighting the disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She really wants to go to Disney,” said Kenya Brooks. “She went a few years ago through make a wish, and she always talks about going back. She’s been through so much, and she just deserves to have fun.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooks, who is Rylee’s grandmother, spoke of Rylee’s six-year battle with cancer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She was diagnosed with brain and spinal cancer around Christmas 2016, and she’s been fighting ever since. She’s had three tumors removed from her brain, and more from her spine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After five years and three major surgeries, Rylee went into remission this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She was in remission from the brain cancer for just five months before being diagnosed with leukemia. She had to go to Boston for a bone marrow transplant, and she was in the hospital for over a month.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rylee recently returned home to Bristol and is residing with her family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol residents, who have asked to remain anonymous, will be hosting “Breakfast with Santa” at Taverna Grill next month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family friendly event will feature food, beverages, crafts, games, and pictures with Santa. Children who attend the event will be given a present from the big man in red himself while supplies last.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proceeds from the family friendly event will be going directly towards Rylee’s trip to Disney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooks said that Rylee loves to dance and spend time with family, including her Mother Ja-nay Brooks and Stepfather Kevin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is her dream,” said Brooks. “We want to make sure that she has the time of her life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Breakfast with Santa will be held on Dec. 11, from 8 a.m.-12 noon at Taverna Grill in Bristol. For those who would like to contribute, donations can be made anytime to” Rylee trip to Disney” account at the Bristol Branch of TD Bank.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
