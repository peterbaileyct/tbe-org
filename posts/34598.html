<p>Outdoor events are especially dependent on the weather. Planners of the Mum Festival have been particularly vulnerable, since the event stretches over three days. Fortunately, over the years, the weather has favored the effort more often than not--rarely has it rained on the festival and the parade at all--but the rains do come, as they did this past weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyone passing the welcome tent at the entrance to the field at Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School would have noticed that the volunteers in their rain garb and toting walkie-talkies. Looking beyond the garb, they would have also been encouraged by the upbeat attitude of these volunteers.</p>

<p>Their spirts could not be dampened by the weather. That in itself is a testament to the spirit of the volunteers and the ones who lead the effort--members of the Exchange Club.</p>

<p>It did help that the rains held off on opening night of the event. Crowds turned out for Fleetwood Macked and the small army of food trucks on hand. Saturday was an overcast day, with intermittent rainfall. Sunday, parade day, was a wash. Overall, the festival attracted over 100 vendors and 16 sponsors. </p>

<p>Behind this effort, beginning in January, 50 or so volunteers, operating under the aegis of the Exchange Club met once a month, and as the festival approached, sometimes twice a month or more as needed. That so many people can come together over such an extended period of time is a testament to the spirit of the festival as well as to the spirt of the community.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is no secret that for most people their days are stretched thin trying to meet the demands of work and family and associated pressures, whether it is arranging daycare for children to health care for the elderly. Volunteers also face these challenges, and yet, they met and made a contribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The festival is not the only the marquee event the Exchange Club fostered this year. The club planned the highly successful Honoring Heroes event in June, leading to a substantial contribution to the Honoring Heroes memorial, which members of the club presented at the recent Police Board meeting earlier this month.</p>

<p>If there is a message for the rest of us, it might be this, simply, that where there is a will there is a way. In addition, it might be that even valiant efforts as this one, require partners. Sponsors of the event helped with financial support that every effort like this one requires. The city, a sponsor, also offered support that helps alleviate some of the financial burden. Everyone has a role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An effort like this requires a community. In the end, however, without the Exchange Club as the organizer, the point person, so to speak, there would be no Mum Festival and Bristol would be lesser for the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the rains do come and when they do, they cannot dampen the spirit of those who have put so much effort into the planning and execution of those plans. As one volunteer said in response to an inquiry about the ultimate goal of the Exchange Club, the biggest success is the people coming out and enjoying themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who ventured out, we believe, the Exchange Club and its volunteers accomplished their goal. Kudos to the Exchange Club for its efforts with the festival and for its efforts in the community overall, especially as a shining example of what a few people can do to make life here better for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the cycle continues, as the club will meet in October to review this year's event and introduce areas for improvement. As for next year, the planning begins in January.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
