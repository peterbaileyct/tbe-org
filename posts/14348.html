<p>The Bristol Blues are having an excellent season in the New England Collegiate Baseball League, winning 12 of its first 14 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s fast start has seen the locals easily scoop up first place in the Western Division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues are currently 2.5 games over second place Valley Blue Sox (9-6) as of Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has been on a hot streak, winning nine straight before posting two straight losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of Bristol’s first three losses, Valley was responsible for two of those setbacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Keene Swamp Bats defeated Bristol by a 6-3 final on Saturday, June 11, and a 9-4 setback to Vermont on Friday, June 24, was the local's other losses of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But between losses to Keene, Valley, and Vermont -- the Blues won those nine games over a multitude of ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven of those victories were by three runs or less as Bristol has been winning all the close ones to snare the lead in Western Conference play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues have been playing a great brand of ball this season -- highlighted by that recent hot streak, starting with a 7-6 victory over Valley on June 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the highlights from Bristol’s recent nine-game winning streak:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 12 -- Bristol Blues 7, Valley Blue Sox 6</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the fun started against the Blue Sox as Bristol notched two runs in the top of the tenth to steal one away from Valley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luke Garofalo won out of the bullpen against the Sox, throwing 1.1 innings of two-hit, four-strikeout ball for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AJ Gaich’s two-RBI single in the top of the tenth sealed the deal for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 14 -- Bristol Blues 5, Valley Blue Sox 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rematch from Muzzy Field, Bristol scored three runs over the first two innings to snare the eventual victory against Valley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaich went 3-for-5 from the dish with two runs scored and an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Farley threw three innings out of the bullpen, yielding just three hits, two walks, and an earned run to seize the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Peter Philips threw two perfect innings to pick up the save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 15 -- Bristol Blues 10, Danbury Westerners 8</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a wild game, Chaz Myers was 3-for-5 while Calvin McCall went 2-for-3 with four RBI as Bristol held on to win by two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>William Paoli seized the win with two scoreless frames and Garofalo held the fort for the save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 16 -- Bristol Blues 15, North Shore Navigators 3</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol racked up a dozen hits and 15 walks to earn another win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Wilson was the hitting star of the day, snatching two doubles, scoring three runs and collecting five RBI while Gaich walked four times and scored three runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Kohls started the game for Bristol (5 IP, four hits, six Ks) allowing just three earned runs to snare the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 17 -- Bristol Blues 4, Marthas Vineyard Sharks 0</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a rare shutout, Jackson Vanesko earned the win against the Sharks -- throwing five innings of no-hit ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay Harry went a slick 2-for-2 with a walk while Wilson added a hit and two RBI as Bristol had won five straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 18 -- Bristol Blues 5, North Adams SteepleCats 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A four-run eighth did-in the SteepleCats as Bristol won again from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues’ seven-hit attack was led by Cal Parrillo, going 2-of-4 with a run scored, while McCall was 3-of-4 -- nabbing a double to go along with two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paoli won out of the bullpen, going 1.2 innings, striking out two, walking one and allowing two hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 19 -- Bristol Blues 2, Ocean State Waves 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored single runs in the first and eighth frames to stave off the Waves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boston Smith tallied two of Bristol’s three hits while Peter Ostensen was strong from the start, going six innings -- allowing one hit while striking out four for the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Griffin Arnone grounded into a fielder’s choice for the first run of the game while Cal Parrillo did the same in the eighth to give Bristol a 2-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 21 -- Bristol Blues 3, Ocean State Waves 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another close one, the Blues trailed 2-0 but scored two runs in the seventh and another in the eighth as the Blues came from behind to win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was all Myers in the eighth as his pinch-hit solo home run ended up making all the difference in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That hit made a winner out of Michael Thomas Morrissey (1.2 IP, 0 ER) while Thomas Benincaso earned the save over his 1.1 innings on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 22 -- Bristol Blues 4, North Adams SteepleCats 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues three run sixth helped the locals snare a win from Joe Wolfe Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers went a slick 3-of-3 from the dish with a double and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colin McVeigh (4.2 IP, five hits, eight Ks), pitching very well this season, earned a tough no-decision as Paoli (1.1 IP, one hit) took home the win for the Blues as the program won its nine straight game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that streak was snapped on Thursday as Bristol fell to Valley by a 5-3 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boston and Matt Smith each went 2-of-4 from the plate to lead the Blues’ offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kohls lasted just two innings over the losing effort as Bristol fell to 12-3 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol lost its first three games by a total of nine runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>On Friday, June 24, Bristol lost for the fourth time -- dropping a tough 9-4 decision to the Vermont Mountaineers (15-1). Trevor Austin led the Blues at the plate (2-for-3, two RBI).</p>
