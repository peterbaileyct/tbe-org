<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - In the world of motion pictures, the only meeting to date between the Bristol and NCL Windsor Locks/Windsor should have been dubbed “29 Days.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s because back on June 8, the squads engaged in a back-and-forth battle over 10 innings - producing a 6-6 score which was stopped due to curfew rules in the city of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the teams finally recommenced the game on Friday, the contest turned into a war of attrition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that battle was won by Bristol as a bases loaded walk by Ryan Maglio forced in Nick Sconziano - leading to a 7-6 triumph from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 improved to 7-6-3 overall while NCL fell to 7-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A crazy way to get to seven runs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how the teams scored when they first squared off on June 8 with the game knotted at 6-6 through 10 completed innings:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL – Top of the first</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Oberle slipped in an infield bunt with one away, moved to second base on a passed ball and scored on a single by Allen Hinckley to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol – Bottom of the third</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio drew a base-on-balls with one out and when Cole Caccano belted a double to the gap in left, men were on second and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio scored on a wild pitch as the showdown was all tied at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the scoring in the third, Connor Cyr (three RBI) flew out to left for the second out – scoring Caccano to score from third base – as it was a 2-1 game in Post 2’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL – Top of the fourth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back-to-back doubles by Jaydon Ramirez and Xavier Angel netted a run to make it an even-steven game at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol – Bottom of the fifth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hometown nine saw Maglio single and was on base as the go-ahead run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccano reached via a fielder’s choice and Rio Fernandez jammed a long fly ball to center, scoring Caccano to propel Bristol to a 3-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a passed ball, Fernandez got to third base off a bad throw-in by the NCL catcher, he came home to score as Bristol led by two (4-2) through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL – Top of the sixth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allen Hinckley slapped a double to the gap in right and Frankie Kula was hit by a pitch, putting two on with just one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ramirez walked to load things up and Bristol starting pitcher Declan Schenck (79 pitches, six hits, three earned runs, five strikeouts, two walks) was relieved by Mike Roalf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A wild pitch scored Hinckley, making it a one-run game at 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL – Top of the seventh</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parker Thomen walked and quickly stole second base and took third base on a wild pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Garrett Hinckley drove in the tying run as his single to right was almost caught by Caccano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thomen ended up scoring to make it a brand-new game at 4-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NCL – Top of the ninth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Jayden Churchill strikeout (five strikeouts), Kula dropped in a long double to left – clearing the bases – as NCL zipped up a 6-4 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol – Bottom of the ninth</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris (two hits) put the ball in play to shortstop – who badly booted it – as Post 2 went to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio zipped a ball up the gut and on a full count, Caccamo walked as the bases were juiced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr sent a slicer into center, scoring Churchill and Maglio, as the game was all tied at 6-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless tenth, the contest was suspended due to curfew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And now, the conclusion (from July 7)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the top of the eleventh, NLC’s Garrett Hinckley slapped an infield single to shortstop on the first pitch from Maglio (now 4-1) and stole second on the next throw.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It appeared Norris had the runner picked off at second base on the ensuing play, making the tag in what was a bang-bang situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The umpire initially signaled the runner was out before changing his mind, calling Hinckley safe - under the protest of LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Oberle then bunted the runner to third base but a fly out and K by Maglio ended NCL’s at-bats in the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be the last offense the visitors were able to produce that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was totally a different pitcher today than he was on that hot day” against Tri-County said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Maglio. “It was just too hot that day. [Against NCL], he was throwing his slider for strikes. He was hitting spots. His fastball had a little extra oomph on it. They weren’t touching him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obviously, in the first inning they got a guy to third with one out and to get out of that [jam] was huge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol then tried to end things in the bottom of the eleventh with Caccamo striking a shot up the middle to put the winning runner at first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He stole second with two away, but Cyr grounded out to third to end the 11th with the score still knotted at 6-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio and the Bristol defense went 1-2-3 in the twelfth with Post 2 threatening again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>EJ Sanchez had an incredible at-bat, fouling off pitch after pitch before smoking a single in between second and third base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nick Sconziano then expertly sacrificed Sanchez to second base and with two outs, NCL went to Jayden Ramirez on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris was intentionally walked to put runners on first and second with two away, but Churchill lined out to shortstop - leading to the 13th frame of a wild 6-6 stalemate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo opened the 13th by diving for a Parker Thomen foul ball in right for the first out and eventually, Maglio retired nine straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You know, everybody was nervous, and the problem was I could have pulled Ryan, saved him,” said LaPenta. “But we have to win one inning to win the game, so I stuck with him. [The NCL coach] decided to keep his guys under 45 pitches. He pulled them and it cost them in the end.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 13th stanza saw Post 2 put a runner in scoring position for the third straight inning when Caccamo absolutely smoked a double down the first base line with one out on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr walked with two gone, but Ramirez ended up fanning Sanchez to end things as the programs were, once again, deadlocked at 6-6 as a 14th inning was needed to settle the score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a guy at second base every inning” of the restart said LaPenta. “We just couldn’t get a hit."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio was at it again, striking out batters and letting the defense do the work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the pitcher did a little work defensively as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the half-inning, Maglio nearly took a line-drive to the face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, with cat like quickness, Maglio slapped the ball away and up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the ball landed safely in Norris’s glove at shortstop, the amazing play ended NCL’s turn at the plate via a 1-6 pop-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s 14th saw Sconziano walk to lead off and then swipe second to get into scoring position and with one out, Parker Thomen took over for Ramirez on the mound as Norris was ready to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris was intentionally walked again, and Churchill drew a traditional base-on-balls to load the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thomen threw six straight balls as Maglio had a 2-0 count from the dish as the NCL coach had a chat with his chucker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple minutes later, Maglio walked, forcing in Sconziano for the game winner as Bristol captured a huge 7-6 win to move over .500 and snare fourth place in the Zone 3, American division standings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s a huge win,” said LaPenta. “It’s tough to get everybody to come here on a suspended game. Now we have to drive down to Danbury and I’m short guys [for the 3:30 p.m. game].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>One hit could have ended the game for either squad over the 14-inning marathon. The teams combined to strand 30 base runners with Bristol responsible for 19 of those men.</p>
