<p>SOUTHINGTON - The Bristol Central wrestling team battled top-ranked Southington on Wednesday night in a CCC Interdivisional showdown as two quality programs locked horns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights, entering the week of January 31 ranked ninth in the state, were able to fend off the Rams by a 51-22 final from Southington High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington improved to 9-2 overall while Central fell to 9-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had some success up and down the lineup as Kaden Dragon, at 113 pounds, was able to get the jump on Trenton Davis - pinning the grappler in 1:03 to generate his squad six points.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then at 160 pounds, Central veteran Lincoln Archibald ended up shutting out Southington’s Mike Affum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Archibald scooped up an 8-0 major decision victory while at the heavyweight positions, Central’s duo of Johnny Rios and Michael Beaucar ended the night with wins for the Rams.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rios (220) won via pinfall over Caden Powers in just 37 seconds and Beaucar (285) was a forfeit winner, not having an opponent to square off against.</p>
