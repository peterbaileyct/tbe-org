<p>Those wins saw the Rams outscore the competition 21-4 as the locals continue to improve their playoff positioning with every victory.</p>

<p>On Monday, Central smashed Wolcott 10-1 in a non-conference battle as Rachel Wygant scooped up four goals to lead the offensive charge.</p>

<p>Maddie Secor added two goals while the combination of Kaylynn LaPointe, Brooke Watson, Sydney Rodriguez, and Abby Lowe all tallied a score over the winning endeavor.</p>

<p>Keeper Alyah Rodriguez Warren was tremendous in the net, making 12 saves to get Central back to the pay window.</p>

<p>And then on Wednesday, it was more of the same as Central flipped Lewis Mills by an 11-3 final in a CCC South confrontation.</p>

<p>Abby Duval and Secor capped the scoring with three goals apiece while Wygant and Rodriguez each notched two.</p>
