<p>BRISTOL – What’s the encore for the Bristol Central girls basketball team after a stellar 11-win campaign last season?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another double-figure victory total and a trip back to the playoffs in 2023?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all in reach for the Rams and after such a bounce-back year, the squad is hungry for more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year’s blend of upperclassmen and youth give veteran head coach Steve Gaudet a mix that should be very successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at the Rams this year:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL GIRLS BASKETBALL</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Steve Gaudet (19th season)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong>: 11-11 overall in 2021-22 (No. 16 Bristol Central lost in the second round to Class L Runner-up No. 1 Newington, 68-31).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 18 seasons at Central, Gaudet carries a career record of 97-264 overall.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Lillian Sirois (guard/forward, 14.8 points-per-game), Ella Watson (forward, 3.2 ppg).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Arianna Rivera (jr, guard, 9.2 ppg), Brooke Watson (jr, guard/forward, 9.1 ppg), Kaley Laird (sr, guard), Callie Lodovico (so, forward, 4.7 points-per-game), Leilani Jackson (so, guard), Nicole Riemer (fr, forward), Molly McMahon (fr, guard), Alexa Huckaby (fr, guard).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Returning veterans&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Overall varsity experience, developing bench</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Central will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;This is a very good crew with a young but eager group of newcomers ready to strut their stuff on the scholastic level. And once you’ve made the state tournament, it’s something you want to take part in over and over again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Relevant Fact:&nbsp;</strong>The Rams have made the state tournament six times under Gaudet. Recently, Central has played six postseason games over the last three seasons – going 3-3 over that tournament stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Considering the all-time winning percentage for the Bristol Central girls basketball team is hovering around 36-percent (the program commenced varsity play in 1974), the 11-11 finish from last year was simply tremendous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it’s time to replicate that success for a second consecutive campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That success starts with a couple junior standouts in the form of Brooke Watson and Arianna Rivera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two guards – combining for over 18.0 points-per-game last year – will ‘D’ up the competition while putting the ball through the hoop on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our returning backcourt is our greatest strength,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“They are going into this year with plenty of varsity experience.&nbsp;Watson was all-conference as a sophomore and Rivera’s starts and contributions last year were all-conference worthy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson will also bomb away from three-point territory. She canned 16 of the squads 40 trifectas, good for 40-percent of the team’s entire total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s senior leader, Kaley Laird, helps pull this team together as she oozes chemistry and has been on several standout scholastic programs at the school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She knows what it takes to be successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird will infuse a little defense and always competes on the court with a big grin on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And bringing back sophomore Callie Lodovico was critical as she was the team’s fourth leading scorer on the squad last season at 4.7 points-per-game – notching 100 points overall as a freshman which was fantastic contribution to the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Laird was our first sub off the bench last year and does all the little things that teams need to be successful,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“Callie started every game last year as a freshman and has put a tremendous amount of work in this offseason to be a major contributor this year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, who’s going to be the fifth man on this squad?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about the first player of the bench?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That twosome could be interchangeable as sophomore Leilani Jackson and freshman Nicole Riemer will vie for those positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson sank home 5.4 points-per-game in limited action last year while Riemer takes her first shots on a scholastic court in what could be a lengthy scholastic career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leilani Jackson is a prolific scorer who brings a ton of athleticism and energy&nbsp;to the game,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“Freshmen Riemer has impressed all preseason with her size, tenacity and intelligence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To round out the group, how about a name from days gone by?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And anytime you have a Huckaby competing on your team, it’s legacy stuff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshmen Alexa Huckaby and Molly McMahon will be invaluable reserves for the Rams this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two athletes are from basketball families and in terms of hoops IQ, they could be big time contributors on the hardwood this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most exciting part is being able to observe these first year players from the start, making their first baskets and competing under the bright lights in varsity play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Molly McMahon and Alexa Huckaby are two freshmen who’s roles will increase as the season moves along and they get more comfortable,” said Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a huge bundle of eager freshmen and once this grouping gets a little more seasoning, with even a little burn in JV games, that experience could see some of those competitors eventually become prime time contributors at the varsity level. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our lack of experience coming off the bench will be a concern but the young kids keep impressing the coaching staff daily,” said Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The longtime coach and his staff are talking tournament and those thoughts could turn into yearly conversations as Central continues to get better by the game as the overall team begins to gel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect some big things out of the program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our goals for this season are to improve every day, to become a cohesive unit and to win a couple tournament games,” said Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch this season</strong>: The Rams have a slew of home games that will come early in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a trip to South Windsor on Tuesday, Central is home for six of the following seven games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Monday, Tolland comes to town (6:45 p.m.) while the squad takes centerstage at the Bristol Central Holiday Classic (December 27, 6 p.m.) against Wolcott Tech.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a slew of road contests, ending with a showdown against Bristol Eastern on January 16 (6:30 p.m.), Central battles non-conference competitor North Haven from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol on Saturday, January 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central begins February with trips to RHAM (on February 3, get your gas money ready. Thanks Mr. Greenleaf…) and Lewis Mills (February 7) before ending the regular season against Berlin (February 10) and in a rematch versus Eastern (February 13).</p>
