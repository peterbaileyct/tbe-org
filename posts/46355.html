<p>A fundraising event filled with music and merriment will “Rock the House” to benefit the Bristol nonprofit Agape House. The event will also celebrate the retirement of the Agape House founders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“It’s wonderful to see the community pull together to help those in need and have a fun day,” Eric Smith said. “All the great food is donated and cooked fresh, there will be live music outdoors with craft beer on tap and big raffles. Our goal this year is to raise over $20,000, so please, if you can, lend us a helping hand.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The benefit concert is being organized by Smith, a four-time Emmy winning producer and owner of Rock Steady Events, and Larry Beaudoin of Beaudoin Design Company and band LB4. "Rock the House" will be held at the VFW Post 19791115 on Wolcott Road in Wolcott on Sunday, June 23, from 2 to 8 p.m. </p>

<p>All proceeds from the concert will support the Agape House, which serves the homeless and people in need in the Bristol community and surrounding areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year’s fundraiser, “Rock the House," is the fourth annual show that Smith and Beaudoin have organized to benefit homeless outreach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Planning and running these events is so rewarding both for me and everyone involved,” Smith said, “because, like the Lynyrd Skynyrd lyrics ‘when you see somebody who’s down and out, lend a helpin’ hand.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outdoor concert will feature musical performances from bands LB4, 42 Salute and an acoustic set from Martin and Read. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to live music, the event will also feature family-friendly games, including horseshoes and cornhole. Attendees are welcome to bring their own chairs or use the picnic tables available on the grounds. Coolers will not be permitted. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Advance tickets are available to purchase online for $20, admission for children 12 and under is free. Beer and non-alcoholic beverages are included in ticket price. Food will be available for purchase with all proceeds from food sales donated to The Agape House.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Faithful stewardship is not only donating our money but giving our time and talents as well,” Beaudoin said. “It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to give to this important cause.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The day will also serve as a celebration for the retirement of Agape House founders, Eugene and Christine Thebarge. In addition to her work with the Agape House outreach ministries and day center, Christine Thebarge has served as executive director with St. Vincent De Paul Mission of Bristol since 2020. </p>

<p>“It is our goal to reduce the suffering and help each individual receive the help they need to start the journey towards self-sufficiency,” Agape House director Matt Norton said.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Agape House is a Christian nonprofit organization that functions entirely on donations and volunteers. Among the many services provided are meals, hygiene items, outdoor needs, clothing, counseling and prayer ministry. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
