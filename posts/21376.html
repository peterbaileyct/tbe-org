<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;In the battle for the Bristol Central Holiday Classic championship on Thursday night, both the Bristol Eastern and Simsbury programs turned the contest into a classic long-range shooting affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams combined to drain 17 total three-pointers but just as the Trojans were shooting lights out over first half play, the team cooled off considerably thanks to pesky Eastern defense, Simsbury was never able to seize a fourth period lead and in the end, the Lancers scooped up a satisfying 63-55 victory from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium to seize the BC Holiday Classic Championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 3-1 overall while Simsbury (4-1) lost for the first time this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters were on fire throughout, hitting 70-percent of its field goals over first half play, and ended the showdown by shooting 59.5-percent from the field overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern dropped in 7-of-16 shots from 3-point land and was able to stave off that hot shooting start from the Trojans.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We talk about execution all the time but I don’t think you can ask for much more than that,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray. “We got great shots which was a product of good shot selection. I don’t think we forced anything. I think everything was earned [through] a couple passes. There weren’t any isolation plays. It was just us working to get open shots, knocking down some.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We got good mixtures of three-point baskets, going to the basket and getting some post moves…a lot of good things happened.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fourteen lead changes and two ties highlighted a tit-for-tat affair but Eastern put some huge finishing touches together to end the third tilt and into the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With four seconds on the clock in the third, Eastern’s Jordan Chisholm (five points, three assists), drained a huge three-pointer to knot the score up at 48-48 with one period left to play as Simsbury’s growing momentum was quickly slashed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jordan’s three-pointer changed the complexion of the game,” said Ray of Chisholm. “Simsbury was about to make a run away from us. But he makes that big shot.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to open the fourth frame, Chisholm found back-up center Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum (six points, four rebounds) for two consecutive lay-ups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Lukas Sward (six points, five assists) made one last pass to Lawrence-Bynum for another high-percentage bucket - completing a 9-0 run with 4:31 to play in regulation as the Lancers ramped up a 54-48 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Then, Isaiah taking advantage of the pressure up front making some big shots in the paint was unbelievable,” said Ray of Bynum. “It was a good job of our guards to get him the ball. And it was even a better job of Bynum to get the ball inside and to make those shots.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down by four early in the first frame, Ben D’Amato (nine points) canned a three and Brayden Dauphinais (21 points, eight rebounds) sandwiched a leaner around two big 3s and with 3:45 showing on the clock, Eastern nabbed a 14-7 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Trojans hit five huge threes over a blistering 17-4 run and with 6:20 remaining before the half, Simsbury held a 26-22 push over Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a 4-0 team for a reason,” said Ray of Simsbury. “They’re a great team. They’re a quality team, well coached. I bet that was an entertaining a first half as you can get if you like offense. They were making shots, we were making them. It was just going back and forth.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers used two late 8-3 runs to reclaim the lead and when Dauphinais hit two free throws with 1:25 left in the second, Eastern was in charge 38-37 - a score that carried over into the third quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Trojans canned 8-of-14 three-pointers by the completion of the first half but limped to a 2-of-9 showing the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bank shot by Simsbury’s Ryan Donahue (team-high 20 points) gave the visitors a one-point edge early in the third period before a 7-0 jaunt from the Lancers - sealed off by a three-point play from Zaveyn Tate (10 points, four rebounds, 3 assists) propelled Eastern to a 45-39 edge with 3:22 left in the third.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams retook the lead via dueling 9-0 runs but Lawrence-Bynum’s final lay-in gave Eastern that 54-48 push with 4:31 left in regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just sat toe-to-toe with them,” said Ray. “We played man-to-man, defense on both sides of the floor, nobody extended, nobody changed any defenses. It was just who’s going to execute more.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just had a few more than they did.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern couldn’t shake Simsbury and when Nick Cordani hit a hoop with 2:11 showing on the clock, the Trojans were down just one (56-55).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ edge was only three with less than two minutes to play as Simsbury went to its 1-3-1 defense - looking to steal the ball away from Eastern’s excellent ball-handlers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t work, the Trojans were forced to foul and it was 1-and-1 time for the Kingstreeters the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drew Fries (six points, five rebounds) went 1-for-2 on the first attempts and when Simsbury missed against, it was Dauphinais’s turn for 1-and-1 opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shooter missed the front end but Fries nabbed the offensive rebound and with 27.2 seconds left, Dauphinais had the ball and was back at the line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He coolly canned two shots, added a couple more charity tosses 13 seconds later and with 13.7 seconds remaining, Eastern led by eight (63-55) as Simsbury never scored again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Fries and Dauphinais corralled the final rebound together, running out the clock, the Lancers were crowned BC Holiday Classic champs over the eight-point victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We shared the ball,” said Ray. “That was great team basketball. There were a lot of contributions from the bench coming in. We didn’t play fatigued. I couldn’t ask for a better effort.”&nbsp;</p>
