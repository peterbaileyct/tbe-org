<p>In both cross country and in girls swimming, Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern had CCC South All-Conference standouts that were recently recognized by the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys cross country teams from Central and Eastern had three CCC South representatives from this past fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Frankie Porrini and Chris Roy, along with Eastern’s Logan Crowley, were a tremendous trio that was honored by the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini, a junior, is as talented as they come on the course locally - took 17th place overall in the CCC Cross Country Championships back on October 19 from Wickham Park in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 17:14 was good for second place in the CCC South standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini had one heck of a showing at the Class L event at Wickham Park on November 1 as he nabbed 11th place overall in 17:21 - punching his ticket to the State Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the Open, Porrini finished the showdown in 17:13 - good for 58th place overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy was eighth at the CCC South event (18:18) while Crowley finished sixth overall in 18:11.9 to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls cross country front, Eastern’s Fiona Gallagher was the only member of the CCC South All-Conference team from the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallagher did a tremendous job at the CCC Championships this fall, finishing 48th overall in a time of 22:27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then at the Class L event, Gallagher place well over the crowded field, nabbing 46th place (22:44) to complete a busy season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In swimming, the Rams and Lancers had excellent finishes from the CCC South league meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the medley relay, Central’s combination of Isabella Cordero, Nyomi Cordero, Rayiah Reinhard, and Katelyn Holleran earned a second place finish (2:00.05) while in the 50 free, Holleran (27.35 seconds) was the runner-up of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Alison Sullivan won the diving event with a score of 206.05&nbsp; and in the 100 fly, Cordero (second place, 1:05.29) made a very good showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holleran nabbed second in the 100 free with a time of 59.77 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, both Isabella and Nyomi Codero earned first place in the 100 back and 100 breast events, respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isabella Cordero won the back in 1:03.87 while Nyomi took the breast with a finish of 1:13.50.</p>
