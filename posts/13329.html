<p>The joint meeting of the Bristol City Council and the Bristol Board of Finance set the city budget for the upcoming fiscal year of 2022-2023 at $215,183,250.00 on Monday night. This represents a 2.67% increase over the budget for the 2021-2022 fiscal year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the budget does show the 2.7% increase, that is offset by an increase in federal and state grants and the growth of Bristol's grand list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mill Rate will therefore remain the same as last year at 38.35 Mills, and the motor vehicle mill rate will be set at 32.46 Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Mill rate of 38.35 means that a Bristol homeowner will pay $38.35 in taxes for every $1,000 of their home's assessed value. So a house assessed at $100,000.00 would bring a tax of $3,835.00. A house assessed at $150,00.00 would be taxed $5,752.50, and a house assessed at $200,000.00 would be taxed at $7,670.00.</p>
