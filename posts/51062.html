<p> "We started well, but the Eagles' sharp passing gave them momentum," said Lancer coach Bill Sweet. "Matt Cabrera and Sam LaMar made some great runs, but we couldn't get a goal in the first half."</p>

<p> Wethersfield's second goal came when Camden Sharkevich cut in and knocked home a hard shot at 22:30 of the second half.</p>
