<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will be preparing for a family party, this time a going away party for child No. 3, who is coming close to fulfilling his and his life partner’s, i.e., girlfriend's, plan to live abroad for a few years. Their destination—Australia. So we are getting together to celebrate, raise a glass, break bread, laugh. We are looking forward to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The big thing here this week, for certain, although the powers-that-be have been pretty quiet about it, is the white supremacist literature drop in the northeast section of Bristol. That it happened on D-Day, that it happened during Pride Month, that it happened here at all, raises questions and demands ... what? I know what I think about it. It’s an abomination. And yet, am I missing something. Does this resonate with others? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>For this week’s listening reading, first and foremost check out Susan Campbell’s column on the CTNewsJunkie.com site. Click <a href="https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2022/06/08/op-ed-white-supremacy-is-a-cancer-and-connecticut-has-it-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Campbell’s op-ed, headlined, “White supremacy is a cancer and Connecticut has it too”&nbsp;mentions the recent activity of white supremacists in Connecticut, in particular, in Bristol. &nbsp;</p>

<p>TBE has reported the incident and the police and mayor’s responses. Campbell pushes forward by addressing the danger that exists in such activity and how each of us needs to be alert to this danger and how we need to stop thinking this is someone else’s problem, when it is ours. Note: I have learned since the TBE report that the literature that was dropped, which has been described as flyers, were not the typical 8 1/2” x 11” sheets one would expect but business-card size slips of paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fallout from the latest mass killings by people with guns—it is difficult to deal with the “politics” and the “language” associated with these killings. Everything important, it appears lately, has been reduced to slogans. Here I take issue with one: “Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.” How about this: “People with guns kill people.” That simplifies things doesn’t it. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why not stick to the tough issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>More reading and listening, this time around, recommends “Socialism is Supposed to Be a Working-Class Movement. Why Isn’t it?” the latest offering from The Ezra Klein Show. Click <a href="https://the-ezra-klein-show.simplecast.com/episodes/bhaskar-sunkara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. I understand socialism is one of those trigger words for most Americans. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Say the word, “socialism,” and people <em>en masse</em>, no matter where they are on the political spectrum, react similarly, meaning emotionally rather than thoughtfully. Whenever “everyone” reacts this way, I am tempted to pull back and ask why? What am I missing? Here’s a podcast that provides some thoughtful commentary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A reminder to check into the Jan. 6 hearings. If it’s the first time, buckle your seat belt. It is difficult to watch. If returning, well, you know that it’s difficult but important.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a happier note, The Bristol Boys and Girls Club celebrated its an inaugural gala fundraiser which drew a huge crowd. The black-tie event, “Paint the Future Gala,” brought together Bristol’s movers and shakers, a bunch of kids who benefit from the BBGC&nbsp;were scattered throughout the venue, loads of sponsors, good food and entertainment. By all accounts, it was a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday, our museums opened to the public for free. The hope is that this will remind people of the wonderful resources we have right here for people to visit more regularly. I have, within walking distance, both the American Watch and Clock Museum, Carousel Museum, and Bristol Historical Society. I’m pretty lucky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our high school sports season is winding down, and--if you read our sports offerings, especially, Mike Letendre, you know how successful this spring has been—here comes The Blues, The Greeners, American Legion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And lastly, high school graduations are on the horizon and a few Pride Day events, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be well!&nbsp;</p>
