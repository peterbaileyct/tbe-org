<p>BRISTOL - There’s never an easy game for the boys scholastic basketball teams in town when sharing the court with the program from Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team has been a great addition to the CCC South lineup after years of competition in the Berkshire League and on Friday night, the Spartans squared off against Bristol Central in another big bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills was able to square up an early double-figure lead and eventually cruised to a 70-44 victory from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to 2-5 overall as the program continues to battle as the lineup is still trying to find a little more consistency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills, under the leadership of head coach Ryan Raponey, has now won five straight games since starting the campaign at 0-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading the charge was Connor Evans again and the 6-foot-4 forward, who dumped 28 points on Bristol Eastern in his previous game, was at it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Central, he zipped up 26 points, 13 rebounds and tallied three steals over another complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sharpshooter Eli Pelletier squared away 19 points while guard Gavin Daly nearly posted a double-double, collecting 10 points and dishing off nine assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills is now 3-0 and has a great chance to win the CCC South Championship if the squad can keep up the pace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Mikey McMahon, the squad’s leading scorer, dropped in 13 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He drained three 3-pointers in an attempt to keep pace with the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joey Pikiell netted nine points, hitting a 3 along the way, while Quincy Lawson also added nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Big Harry Ross netted seven points but Evans was just on another level for the second consecutive game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills led 24-11 through one period of play and nabbed a 40-23 edge at the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still a 17-point deficit through three periods of play while Central eventually fell by 26 points in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second straight loss for the Rams who finished their first five games of the year at 2-3..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central falls to Middletown on Wednesday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams battled CCC South challenger Middletown to open the week, dropping a tough 71-55 decision to the Blue Dragons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central trailed 21-5 after eight minutes of play and trailed 44-17 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quadir Murphy slipped in a game-high 26 points while Branden Torres added 19 to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McMahon, who continues to shine from downtown, posted a team best 17 points - hitting five threes in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nate Ortiz had nine points, Cody Roy added a season-high eight points, Ross netted seven while Pikiell and Lawson each posted four apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC grind continues into the month of January for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central travels to Newington next week to square off against a double-tough CCC interdivisional challenger on Tuesday (6:45 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days later, the Rams are back home, taking their best shot against Platt in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after an eight-day layoff, the Rams welcome non-conference challenger Xavier to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on Friday, January 19 at 6:45 p.m.</p>
