<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;Twenty-five years ago, the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team dropped a tough 56-53 decision against St. Joseph in double overtime during a Class L semifinal from Sheehan High School back on March 12, 1997.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it would be a long time before the rematch between the squads would take place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the programs reconnected on the hardwood on Thursday as the Lancers closed out the 2022 portion of its schedule with a tough 46-29 loss to St. Joseph - falling to 2-3 overall - from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cadets foiled the Lancers early and often and did not allow the home team to score over first quarter play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Eastern never fully crawled out of that hole, the Kingstreeters played the rest of the game nearly even-steven against St. Joseph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Poor first half shooting, gaffes, goofs and turnovers put Eastern in a huge hole as the team trailed 11-0 after eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Autumn Udoh (team-high 13 points) foul shot early in the second quarter finally got the locals on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers did not get their first field goal until Jayle Evins-Mosley (four points) scored on a put-back at the four minute mark of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Cadets led 17-5 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Joseph continued to enjoy that sizable cushion into the third but had to withstand a bit of an Eastern run early in the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh started hitting the paint with zest, notching eight points inside, while Vanessa Drury (eight points) connecting on three buckets, two of which ended in three point plays, as Eastern trailed just 31-23 with the fourth frame on tap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth quarter,&nbsp;Taigan Parent's only hoop of the showdown trimmed the deficit to six (31-25) as the Cadets were feeling the pressure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It went back and forth from there, with Udoh dropping in another hoop, as it remained a two-possession game at 33-27 midway through the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Cadets put the event away via a 11-0 burst over a three-and-a-half minute stretch and with 2:20 left on the clock, the visitors led 44-27 and were in complete control of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visiting aggression eventually wrapped up a 17-point win to improve to 3-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ayotte also scored for the Lancers who start the 2023 calendar year at home against always pesky Berlin (2-4) on Monday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 6 p.m.</p>
