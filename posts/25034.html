<p>The sport of girls youth lacrosse in the city of Bristol continues to grow at a rapid rate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those entry programs are not only helping to increase interest in the sport but allowing the high school teams in Bristol to add to its ranks as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Stavens, a long time proponent of the sport of lacrosse in town with two of his kids playing scholastically at Bristol Eastern, has reported that the Bristol Youth Lacrosse Program has added a new senior level team - now carrying two squads.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior team is athletes in fourth through sixth grade, while the senior program carries grades sixth through eighth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“After restarting the girls program seven years ago, the youth program continues to grow,” said Stavens. “In addition, that growth has led to increased success at the high school level.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the teams at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern are a combined 6-3 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scholastic program in the city, at one point, was a coop team but due to the success of the sport, and a growing number of athletes, each high school carries thriving and prospering squads, surrounded by excellent coaching.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the results speak for themselves as both the Rams and Lancers were state tournament qualifiers last season and should be again in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the complete schedule for both the senior and junior lacrosse programs from Bristol which starts play this coming Wednesday:&nbsp;</p>
