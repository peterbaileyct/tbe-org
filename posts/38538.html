<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team had a tremendous debut on Tuesday night, leading just about wire-to-wire over the Lancers’ 79-51 throttling of Manchester in a CCC Interdivisional bout from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also the opening contest for Manchester, leading by two early before an 9-2 run – with Eastern’s Amanda Noel (career high 16 points, 10 rebounds) posting all nine points – as the Kingstreeters shut down the Red Hawks vaunted offensive attack from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This biggest thing is I’m very happy for these guys,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “They worked hard….they executed tonight. They followed the game plan like we wanted to and I got some good minutes from [the first-year students].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh led the Lancers with 23 points (19 came over second half play) and 10 rebounds while crafty Vanessa Drury zipped up 15 points, six rebounds, six assists, two steals and drained three 3-pointers over a complete game effort.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her floor leadership went a long way in Eastern’s successful transition attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She did a great job in just settling everybody down tonight, running the offense and getting people going,” said Floyd of Vanessa Drury.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sister Savannah Drury – a freshman playing, and starting, in her first varsity game at Eastern – contributed five points and three assists while fellow first year players Cassie Sward (seven points) and Alaina Joy (six points, four rebounds) played their roles to near perfection, showing some slick early season poise and guile.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slowing down the high-scoring Tiara Tyson was the key to it all and while the Manchester talent was still sensational (32 points), the likes of Lauren Ayotte (five points, three rebounds, five assists) and Noel – among others – kept the talented guard from truly popping off with some physical and aggressive defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That kid is an excellent player, one of the better players in the state,” said Floyd of Tyson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, it was all Eastern as Manchester got few open looks, misfiring on 25 of its first 30 field goal attempts as the home squad opened a 20-point lead early  Min the third period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All that excellent defense was turned into several offensive chances, limiting Manchester’s looks on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We run. They got into transition very well,” said Floyd. “And the big thing is they listen to detail and that’s what I’m very pleased about.”<br>Eastern shot over 53-percent from the field while outrebounding Manchester by ten.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Noel splashed in the first nine points of the first period, Joy added two late buckets as the home team led 13-8 after one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Even the young kids off the bench, Cassie Sward and Alaina Joy, they did a nice job on the guard play,” said Floyd. “Joy gave me some great minutes out there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manchester’s Aaliyah Lawrence hit a 3 early in the second stanza to trim the deficit to 15-11 but the opponents couldn’t inch any closer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that hoop, Udoh found Ayotte for a bucket, Vanessa Drury canned a 3, Noel kicked in a traditional three-point play and when Shavannah Drury hit on a coast-to-coast lay-up, Eastern led 25-17 with 4:01 left in the half.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They moved the ball very well tonight,” said Floyd. “They got into transition very well and they shot well.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That edge reached double-figures by halftime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a half-ending 6-1 burst, Noel hit a jumper and two charity tosses while Sward found Udoh for a hoop as Eastern carried a 33-18 cushion into the break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Autumn Udoh and Amanda Noel have really brought their games up,” said Floyd of his forward duo.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh then put the squad on her back over the third period play, scoring at will, and picking up 15 big points – with her huge 3-pointer with 4:07 left in the quarter making it a 46-25 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I really think Autumn picked it up in the second half, defensively and offensively,” said Floyd. “She really did a super job. I was really pleased with her.”&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh hit the final four points to close the third stanza and with eight minutes to play, the Kingstreeters nabbed a 58-37 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern closed out the game early in the fourth behind a three-minute 11-3 burst with Vannessa Drury and freshman Natalia Vye sinking in hoops to help the Lancers scoop up a sizable 69-40 advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They showed what their potential is and what their capabilities are,” said Floyd of his freshmen crew. “As we get seasoned, I think we’re going to see some great things from these kids.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the final period, Sward hit a sweet up and under move, blasted in a 3, and when Grace Browne found Joy for one final hoop, Eastern made its first game count behind a satisfying 79-51 triumph.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They played hard defensively,” said Floyd. “I would say our defense was the reason why we played so well.”&nbsp;</p>
