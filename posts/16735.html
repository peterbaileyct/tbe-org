<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1927, Mayor John F. Wade died in office and then Councilman Crumb was elected by the city council to complete Mayor Wade’s term. He was elected in his own right in 1929 but lost in 1931 to Joseph Dutton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following his term as mayor, Mr. Crumb was an executive with New Departure and in 1945 left Bristol for business opportunities in California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Crumb was born in Forestville in 1896. If he were still alive, he would be 126 years old and a contemporary of TBE contributing editor, Jack Krampitz and to some extent Dave Fortier.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
