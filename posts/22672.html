<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut High School Football Alliance will once again put together a tremendous slate of non-conference games for the 2023 scholastic campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, 88 games will take place over eight weeks of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All thirty teams from the Central Connecticut Conference will be involved in the games which will include the squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also involved in the Alliance showdowns are teams from the Southern Connecticut Conference, the Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, the Eastern Connecticut Conference, the South-West Conference and even programs from the Connecticut Technical Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Week 1 and Week 3 will see heavy involvement from the programs of the CCC and that’s where the Rams and Lancers come in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On just Week 3 alone, thirty-eight Alliance games will be contested, and both the Bristol teams will be in action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central stays home for its Alliance game, squaring off against Fairfield Warde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Eastern must take the road to square off against Hillhouse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Central, it will be the first ever showdown against Fairfield Warde while Eastern has some history against Hillhouse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are 1-2 against the Academics over the years in non-conference confrontations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first game for the Class MM defending champs in 1989, Hillhouse came to Bristol on September 15, 1989, in a battle from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hillhouse was shutout 14-0 as Eastern drew its one and only victory against the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern quarterback Steve Mills (8-for-16, 116 yards) made a 12-yard touchdown connection with J.C. Russell while Jason Abbott scored on a six-yard rush to give the Lancers its 14-0 victory over the Academics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was the final season for Eastern under the watchful eye of head coach Dave Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>QB Steve Mills (4,908 career yards passing, 44 touchdowns) also played his final season at BEHS that year and was off to Yale at the completion of his senior campaign.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
