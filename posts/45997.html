<p>Mentors and trailblazers can come in all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; On Tuesday night at Bristol Eastern High School, both were on display as the BE Empowered Club hosted their first ever speakers panel. Nine amazing women took to the stage and spoke to their experiences in different careers. The Empowered Club’s mission is to provide support to girls in the BE community and beyond as they embrace their strengths, learn to lead, and consider their future careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each woman offered a unique perspective on life and gave great advice to help young girls feel empowered. They spoke of challenges, setbacks, and perseverance.&nbsp; In the process, the women told stories of mentors on their own journeys, and the many ways in which they set their paths to success.</p>

<p>The Panel was moderated by members of the club, and their advisor, Ms. Nocera, helped to put the event together.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The evening started with prepared questions from the members of the club, followed by open questions from the audience, and was followed by a meet and greet with refreshments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hearing the women’s stories was inspiring and hopefully made those who attended feel empowered to make a change. The club hopes to continue this event and for it to grow in the years to come.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
