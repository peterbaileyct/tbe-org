<p>From&nbsp;February 1&nbsp;through&nbsp;June&nbsp;30, 2022,&nbsp;Bristol families who receive WIC benefits will also receive free admission to the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum and the New England Carousel Museum.</p>

<p>This program will allow the roughly 1,200 families with a Bristol WIC card to visit the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum&nbsp;and&nbsp;The New England Carousel Museum, as well as&nbsp;The Museum of Fire History, which is located on the second floor of the Carousel Museum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Many families who receive WIC benefits are living on strict budgets, which&nbsp;often&nbsp;cannot expand to cover the cost of admission to museums and other cultural attractions,” said Morgan&nbsp;Urgo, Executive Director of The New England Carousel Museum. “With this program, both museums can become a location for families to visit together, make memories, and have a&nbsp;positive, educational, and fun&nbsp;experience with their family.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patti Philippon, Executive Director of the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum said, “We hope that many families will take advantage of the free admission being offered at both museums. We are grateful to the Women &amp; Girls’ Fund at the Main Street Community Foundation for their support of this program, which allows us to expose the wonderful arts and culture community that exists in Bristol to a wider audience.” </p>

<p>Participants will need to show a valid&nbsp;WIC&nbsp;card at each museum's reception desk to receive admission&nbsp;for their families.&nbsp;Admission to the&nbsp;Carousel Museum&nbsp;also&nbsp;includes one free ride&nbsp;per person&nbsp;on their indoor carousel. This&nbsp;free&nbsp;program&nbsp;cannot be applied to&nbsp;fee-based programs&nbsp;and events at the museums.</p>

<p>This program was&nbsp;created in partnership with the Bristol Hospital WIC Program, and&nbsp;generously sponsored by the Women &amp; Girls’&nbsp;Fund at the Main Street Community Foundation.</p>
