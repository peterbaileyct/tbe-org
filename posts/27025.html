<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Class L boys track and field championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain was an excellent outing for the program at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams made an impressive fourth place finish among a very tough field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event was won by Xavier of Middletown - a school of choice - zipping up 116 points to seize the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hillhouse (68 points) was the runner up, Amity (65) placed third while Central and Simsbury (50) each tallied fifty points - tying for fourth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had several athletes finish among the top five, instantly qualifying for the CIAC State Open event on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The day in New Britain was owed by Central senior Tre Blair as the standout athlete won the Class L title in both the long and high jumps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It felt amazing,” said Blair of the event. “It was just everything I could have dreamed of.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair, already Central’s school record holder in the triple jump, won the championship behind a leap of 46 feet, 2.5 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He broke his own school record,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Everyone was chasing him from there."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up holding off another Blair, Micah Blair of Amity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Blair finished in second place with a make of 45 feet, 10.75 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayson Burchell took third place (45-10), but all the athletes ended up finishing behind the Rams’ All-State performer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was amazing,” said Stafford-Kirk of Blair’s performance. “He’s been trending that way all season but to step up in the big meets, Tre is the type of kid who always wants a challenge. He was seeded number two in the long jump but was like, ‘I’m going to take this.’ The other kid [Micah Blair] passed a couple jumps thinking maybe Tre wasn’t going to jump as far as he did. Tre took advantage of that and in the triple, he’s just been so dominant.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s just a great thing to watch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the long jump, Blair was the only person to clear 22 feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair made a leap of 22 feet, 2.25 inches, becoming a dual championship at the Class L tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tre is a pronominal young man,” said Central assistant coach Tyrell Holmes. “This young man, when I first came here, he was a leader right away [and] filled a role that I was looking for. I was looking for a jumping leader, the person I can call on with the younger guys who leads by example. This year, it came to fruition because when I say that every time, I needed something explained [or] I needed something shown, he led by example.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And it shows given where he’s at and I couldn’t be more pound of this young man.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not far behind Blair in the jumping events was teammate Anthony Paulino, a talented junior who easily improved throughout the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paulino earned third place in the long jump, hitting the mark at 21 feet, 3.75 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No other junior finished higher than Paulino.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the triple jump, Paulino hit a jump of 42 feet and three-quarter inches to secure fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s got a lot of room to go so we’re excited about that,” said Stafford-Kirk of Paulino. “Athletes like Anthony make it easier for me to sleep at night when I have to think about losing athletes like Tre and Frankie Porrini. We’ve got some great young talent and I think we’re going to be a force to be reckoned with net year."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the leapers weren’t the only ones who advanced to the State Open showcase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Logan Jackson made a top-five placing in the 110 meter hurdles, making a finish of 15.51 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Logan Jackson has become an awesome hurdler and it’s been so fun to watch his progression,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the javelin, junior Wyatt Gibson made a successful toss of 142 feet, six inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what would the State Open be without senior standout Frankie Porrini in one of the distance events?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini ran in the 1600 meters, seizing fifth place overall with a finish under 4:20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied a time of 4:19.59 to keep his postseason march going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a tremendous grouping that will travel back to New Britain for another day of track and field action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie Porrini dipped under 4:20 in the 1600 which was super exciting,” said Stafford-Kirk of Porrini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had several other performances that just missed the mark in terms of State Open qualification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Aengus Repeta was a mere three feet away from a top-five showing in the discus, making a throw of 131 feet, two feet while in the pole vault, the Rams had two athletes that cleared 11 feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jude Browning and Kenny Whitford, two slick juniors, took seventh and eighth place, respectively, over a very competitive event in the pole vault.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini was back at it in the 3200 meters, placing eighth in a time of 9:45.71 while the 4x800 meter relay team also accomplished a top-eight showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grouping of Julieen Lopez, Isaiah Fabrizio, Chris Roy, and Porrini ended the tough event with a time of 8:26.42 for eighth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Open</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a legitimate chance to bring a little more postseason hardware home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Blair has more to show the competition before the completion of his scholastic career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I still have more in store for the Open and the Nationals,” said Blair. “I just want to put on a show.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Stafford-Kirk knows that what winning the Open event means to Blair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s fun. It’s been really exciting and especially going into the State Open,” said Stafford Kirk of Blair. “Being a Class L champion is a huge deal but winning the Open, the entire state, that’s what he wants. He’s not going to be satisfied until he has that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re looking forward to the next few weeks with that, hopefully, the New England's and then the Nationals.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The future of the program is in good hands</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford-Kirk knows that her rebuilding team is going to be in tremendous shape come next season with all its returning talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Junior throwers Wyatt Gibson and Aengus Repeta killed it out there as well,” said Stafford-Kirk. “With the juniors who scored today along with Rowan Hennessey and a strong sophomore class including Julieen Lopez, Isaiah Fabrizio, Aiden Georgakopoulos, Tristian Toussaint, Tashawn Cauley, Nate Davis, and Will Postell, we look to pick up strong next year.”</p>
