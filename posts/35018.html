<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Writer shares values with Rosado and team</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the editor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am enthusiastically endorsing Scott Rosado for Mayor and the Council slate. I admire the fact that the Democrats have put together a team that shares my values, is positive, and is looking to build upon the many good things in Bristol. They are also very pro-active in recognizing some of the challenges that we have including homelessness and helping people get into recovery and stay in recovery. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Society has changed so much since I was a kid, and we need a government that is ready to roll with the changes and react to them. I recently met Liza Salgado who is running for Council in my District and have known Rippy Patton for years. They are a breath of fresh air compared to our current councilwomen who have voted no on many items over the last two years. I want yes, how can we get things done, not a series of non-productive no votes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Senior citizen asks, 'What is being done for seniors?'</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the editor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What has the current administration in Bristol done for senior citizens?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am 68-year-old, and while I walk often with a cane or a walker, I do live an active and fulfilling life. I do not have a car and do ride on CT transit buses. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I live on North Main Street in senior housing. No one obeys the 25 mph speed limit. The vehicles do not stop for people in the crosswalks. Two of my neighbors have been hit by cars in the past year, putting both of them in the hospital with serious injuries for months. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I sent several emails to the Mayor's office. He never&nbsp;responded.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior tax credit doesn't apply to me as I don't own a home.  A senior homeowner getting a few dollars back in their pockets is nothing and no reason to vote Republican. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want action and the only&nbsp;way I am going to get it is to vote for the Democratic party.&nbsp; All of the folks that&nbsp;I have met are truly&nbsp;engaged and care about the people of Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please join me in voting for the Democratic slate on Nov. 7. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">District 1 candidates draw support for experience</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the editor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a proud Forestvillian in the 1st District, I am proud to support two excellent candidates for City Council to represent us.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller has been very active politically in Bristol. He is a small businessman in the city. He is the father of three children and he and his husband have both been involved in multiple levels in making this community a better place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kim Caron has extensive business experience in the legal field and in banking. Most recently she’s worked for a large non-profit agency. She has been involved in Bristol community issues for a very long time. She knows how every aspect of the business world works.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democratic team, led by former city councilman, Navy veteran, senior advocate and local business owner, Scott Rosado, is ready to build a better Bristol for all. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vote on Nov. 7. Make a change for the better.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
