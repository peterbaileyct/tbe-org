<p>When the Central Connecticut Conference announced its All-Conference teams last week, several Bristol student-athletes were honored by the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And athletes from just about every sport from the Mum City were represented for the fall season of 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight members of Central’s 9-2 football program were honored by the CCC South while the Lancers (4-6) added five players to the list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were, of course, highlighted by All-State talent Victor Rosa who finished the season with 2,728 yards and 41 touchdowns on his way to the University of Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern had a superstar of its own in the form of Alex Marshall - rushing for a school single-season record of 1,728 yards to go along with 21 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In boys soccer, Central’s foursome of Beckett Hennessey, Mark Palma, Carson Rivoira, and Ethan Crumrine, were all CCC South honorees over a tremendous 12-4-2 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crumrine chipped in two goals and 11 assists, Palma added seven goals and nine assists, Hennessey was the defensive enforcer for the program while Rivoira jammed in a team-high 19 goals while dishing off eight assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That group tallied 28 total goals and helped the program to one of its most successful campaigns ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s soccer duo of Adam Borry and Dom Femiak also took home CCC South honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Borry did a little of everything for the Eastern program while Femiak was the scoring leader of the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central girls soccer team just missed out on the playoffs but the trio of Emily Lowe, Rachel Wygant and Ashlee Crumrine played extremely well while Eastern’s grouping of Ciara Collins, Cecelia Gilbert and Audra Porowski&nbsp;guided the program to the Class L playoff field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s volleyball team had another fantastic season, earning second place in the CCC South and earning a second round slot in the Class L Tournament fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sklenka, Madison Lodovico, Olivia Clingan and Brooke Valentino led the charge for the locals and were CCC South honorees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went 15-8 overall in 2021, sweeping Farmington in first round Class L play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the program over at Bristol Eastern made a huge run to take the CCC South title, captured the CCC Volleyball Tournament championship over eventual Class L runner-up Simsbury, three games to one (24-26, 25-17, 25-20 and 25-18), and rode that momentum all the way to the Class L semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the outstanding grouping of Hannah Webber, Lauren Bender and Abby Jones all were honored by the league for the Lancers’ 20-plus win campaign.</p>
