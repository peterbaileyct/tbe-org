<p>St. Paul got off to a good start in the Class S State Tournament this year with a 9-2 win over Immaculate yesterday at St. Paul Catholic High School.</p>

<p>Logan Rembish earned the win for the Falcons going 6 strong innings, allowing two runs on three hits while striking out 10. Starter Tyler Fahey took the loss for the Mustangs.</p>

<p>Immaculate took an early 1-0 lead scoring a run in the top of the first inning. With two outs, catcher Tom Pilla singled to left. Ryan Colwell followed with an RBI double to the center field fence, and Immaculate was on top 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the lead was short lived. In the bottom of the frame, leadoff hitter Keaton Kroll walked. Catcher Cal Chance deposited a 1-0 pitch over the right field fence, and St. Paul led 2-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the second, Nate Barrett led off with his first varsity home run to extend the St. Paul lead to 3-1. Then with two out, Kroll worked his second walk of the game. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chance followed with a single that sent Kroll to third. Chance then stole second to put two men into scoring position, and Coby Dagata brought them both home with a two RBI single. St. Paul led 5-1 after two innings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Jay DeRosa and Kroll had back-to-back singles to open the inning. Chance brought them both home with a long double, and then later scored when Coby Dagata's line drive to left was mishandled. St. Paul led 8-1 after four innings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immaculate got one run back in the top of the fifth. After a couple of walks, Pilla stroked an RBI single to make it 8-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul scored the final run of the game in the bottom of the sixth. Dagata hit his third single of the afternoon, and was replaced by pinch runner Nate Cravanzola. Rembish hit an RBI double to score Cravanzola, and St. Paul led 9-2 after six innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Wilson relieved Rembish and pitched to top of the seventh for St. Paul. Wilson allowed only one batter to reach on a walk, and the final was 9-2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
