<p>New Britain’s Alex Heidel threw a no-hitter against Bristol Eastern on Monday night, leading the Hurricanes to a 3-0 win over the Lancers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heidel, a senior left-hander, threw 88 pitches in his complete game effort, allowing just two baserunners. &nbsp;Eastern’s Preston Guarda reached on an infield error in the second inning, while Caleb Molinsky walked in the third. &nbsp;Heidel struck out six.</p>

<p>Eastern pitcher Declan Schenck matched Heidel over the first three innings, retiring nine of the first ten&nbsp;batters, &nbsp;giving&nbsp;up just one hit, while throwing just 29 pitches through the three innings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then in the fourth, New Britain’s Pat Costa singled to center to open the frame. &nbsp;Schenck retired the next two batters, but&nbsp;with two outs, Landon Roberts and Alex Rosales&nbsp;both&nbsp;singled to score Costa&nbsp;with the game’s first run.</p>

<p>In the fourth, New Britain added two additional runs. &nbsp;Anthony Fusco opened the inning with an infield single to deep short, was sacrificed to second, and scored on Kishan&nbsp;Pietersz’s&nbsp;double to left. &nbsp;Singles by Costa and Gonzalez scored&nbsp;Pietersz with the&nbsp;final New Britain run.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
