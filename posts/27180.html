<p>MARLBOROUGH - The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team is expecting to have a good season in 2023 though the program no longer competes in the now defunct Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 added some new players this season after several 19-year-olds finished up their eligibility in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several Junior competitors from last season’s state tournament team will make up part of the Senior roster this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The return of Norris and Churchill</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An element of Bristol’s success this season will come from the play of veterans Elliot Norris and Jayden Churchill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the duo, once again batting 1-2 in the order, will help Bristol set the table early and often this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s huge,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Norris and Churchill returning. “You have a little experience between the two.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The twosome can flat out slap the ball all over the field and have the speed to outrun any tally smashed around the infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, is there a better shortstop than Norris?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about the play of Churchill in centerfield?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That kind of experience counts in large amounts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of experience, Bristol is adding Chase Belisle (University of St. Joseph) to the lineup as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Wolcott High School standout can bat towards the top of the order for Post 2 and has a stick to match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got Chase. He’s a 19-year-old,” said LaPenta. “He’s going to be splitting time between us and another team. I’ll take him because he’s such a good player and he sees the ball really well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Wolcott, the Post 2 line-up could employ the likes of Joesph Dunne and Luke Colfer in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There could be some Farmington and Plainville influence as well since none of those towns play American Legion Baseball anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Cole Caccamo will help augment play in the outfield and at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The roster is not quite set,” said LaPenta. “I have four kids from Wolcott that signed up. They’re still playing [for a state championship]. So, we have a few things to work out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be plenty of help from Bristol Central and this roster will be as diverse as any Bristol’s carried, perhaps, ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a pretty good Bristol Eastern influence as well with Connor Cyr, Isaac Roberge, Ryan Maglio, and Michael Roalf - the latter two seeing some extensive time on the hill - all helping the program along the way as will catcher Rio Fernandez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rio Fernandez wasn’t here but he’ll be here” against NCL/Windsor Locks/Windsor on Friday said LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Juniors are already winning</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Junior team started the year perfectly on Tuesday, spinning Ellington by a 2-1 final from Riley Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky went the distance for Post 2, allowing the single run and just a smattering of hits to seize the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol notched a run in the second inning and off a few singles, the locals were able to earn a walk-off in the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Juniors are looking pretty good,” said LaPenta. “They won on a walk off last night.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta is filling in for Junior head coach Bill Mason at the moment and the long time Bristol coach is going back to his roots while still coaching the Seniors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2011, LaPenta led the Bristol Junior program to the Connecticut state championship and a showing at the Northeast Regional that was held in New Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron, Ryan Fradette, and Trevor Mays, past American Legion players from Bristol, will be assisting Mason and LaPenta at the Junior level as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some of those players from the Junior division will be playing up from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Between the Seniors and Juniors, we’ll probably have to dual roster a couple of kids,” said LaPenta. “But hey, Juniors on a walkout last night and we hang on here [in Marlborough] in our first game, can’t ask for anything better than that to start the season.”</p>
