<p>When state tournament play opens up this year in volleyball, both the programs from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern will be top-10 seeds in the Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (13-7 overall) and Lancers (12-7) finished eighth and ninth, respectively, in the standings and will have at least a couple home matches before things are said and done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But before all of that commences, it’s time for the annual CCC Volleyball Tournament -- a big postseason tune-up for most of the local programs that some of Connecticut’s best teams will be taking part of. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central captains Alex Rivera, Grace Higgins and Kily Kirk will lead their sixth ranked troops into first round battle with a home match on Monday night against #11 Tolland (12-8 overall) in a showdown at 6 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium -- the host site of the CCC Tournament this year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner moves on to play the victor between No. 14 Newington and No. 3 Windsor in second-round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is the possibility that Central wins its opening bout, goes on the road to play Windsor, and then returns back to Bristol for the remainder of tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of town, Adrianna Reay, Emma Cretella and Naseem Hennouch lead the No. 9 ranked Lancers into tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has somehow drawn No. 8 Simsbury as the squads have been familiar opponents in CCC Tournament play over recent years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will travel to Simsbury for that exciting bout (6 p.m.) on Monday with a date against either No. 16 Enfield and top-seeded Southington on deck for the winner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how the CCC Tournament breaks down this year:</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
