<p>Representatives of Bristol Public Schools, KultureCity and state officials gathered at Ivy Drive School on Wednesday to unveil the first school-based sensory room in the Northeast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The beautiful sensory room here at Ivy Dr. school was designed and built for our students to access pro-social regulation tools in a safe and adaptive space built to promote regulation,” said Emily Gomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I began my career as a special education teacher working primarily with students with challenging behaviors and difficulty managing and regulating their emotions,” continued Gomes. “After many years working with students facing these challenges, I have come to recognize that the function of many of these behaviors is sensory regulation.”</p>

<p>Gomes is the principal of Ivy Drive School.</p>

<p>“To see the school district here in Bristol step up and teach students that it's OK to be autistic, to have PTSD, to have other invisible disabilities is something that you can embrace about yourself and be a part of the world and you get to share that with the rest of the world is such a critical step towards building a better future, and that's what's happening here today,” said Sean Culkin.</p>

<p>Culkin is a KultureCity board member and an autism self-advocate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One in six people has a sensory need or invisible disability such as autism, ADHD, PTSD and more that can affect their ability to perform daily functions. Staff members of Ivy Drive School were trained through a certification process to recognize students with sensory needs and handle situations involving sensory overload using available tools such as the sensory room.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two additional sensory rooms are currently being completed at Ellen P. Hubbell Elementary School and Chippens Hill Middle School.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
