<p>The Bristol Sports Hall of Fame will host a 1960’s Sports Reunion at the Bristol Historical Society on Wednesday, June 1, at 7:00. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reunion organizer Dave Mills has lined up Gary Palladino and Bart Beardsley from Bristol Eastern, Greg Ziogas and Mike Giovinazzo from Bristol Central, Tony Carrier from both St. Anthony’s and Bristol Central, and Jack Krampitz from St. Paul to share some stories of their high school years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The real purpose for the evening is to give everyone who attends a chance to share their high school experiences, humorous stories, and big game moments. The people listed above are really going to be there just to get the ball rolling. The rest will be up to the audience to keep it going, so bring your memories with you.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no admission fee for the event, and refreshments will be provided by the Hall of Fame. Beer and wine and snacks will be available.</p>

<p>Also, since most of the attendees are expected to be over the age of 75, canes, walkers, and oxygen tanks will be provided free of charge.</p>
