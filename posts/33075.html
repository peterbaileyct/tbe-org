<p>We’re creeping towards the start of the scholastic football season and that means it’s time to take a closer look at the Central Connecticut Conference and Naugatuck Valley Leagues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a little reshuffling in the CCC in terms of its divisions and more than a couple of teams moved up and down over the four CCC tiers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our local squads - Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern - remain in the same CCC tier while St. Paul Catholic is still a member of the Brass Division in the NVL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though teams like Bloomfield and Ansonia are truly miscast in terms of CIAC divisions (both should be competing in Class MM or L), there’s enough balance to make things as equal as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s looks at both the CCC and NVL and the makeup of squads from each league:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central Connecticut Conference - Football, 2023</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tier 1 (including records from 2022)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Conard (3-7 overall)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*East Hartford (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Glastonbury (8-2)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Hall (5-5)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Maloney (9-1)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*New Britain (5-5 in Tier 2)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Simsbury (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Southington (9-1)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Last season, Newington was a member of Tier I but dropped down to Tier II for the 2023 campaign. New Britain took Newington’s spot, moving up from Tier II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Berlin (10-0 in Tier 3)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Central (2-8)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Enfield (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Manchester (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Middletown (6-4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Newington (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Wethersfield (8-2)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Windsor (6-4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Tier II has a new competitor in the form of Berlin, jumping up one division. South Windsor got booted down to Tier III and will now battle the likes of Bristol Eastern. Bristol Central (2-8 in 2022) remains in Tier II and should be a mover in shaker once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Avon (5-5)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Eastern (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Edwin O. Smith (6-4 in Tier 4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Farmington (3-7)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Platt (6-4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*RHAM (7-3)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Rocky Hill (8-2 in Tier 4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*South Windsor (1-9 in Tier 2)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Well, Berlin, Bloomfield and Plainville are out. Tier III might be the most balanced of all four of the divisions. There should be a ton of parity in this tier if everything plays out how it should. The Lancers (3-7) have the opportunity for success in Tier III this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tier 4</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bloomfield (8-2 in Tier 3)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*East Catholic (7-3)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Hartford Public (6-4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Lewis Mills (1-9)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Northwest Catholic (2-8)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Plainville (0-10 in Tier 3)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Tolland (4-6)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Tier 4 sees powerhouse Bloomfield in the mix with Edwin O. Smith and Rocky Hill moving up a division. Plainville is probably a better fit here than in Tier 3 after not winning a game in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Naugatuck Valley League</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Copper Division</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Ansonia</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Gilbert/Northwestern/Housatonic</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Holy Cross</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Naugatuck</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Seymour</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Watertown</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Wolcott</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Woodland</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>How does Ansonia, who won the 2022 Class S championship, not get booted up to - at least - Class M? They are always in the playoffs, usually carrying a regular season ledger of 10-0 (or close to it). It’s almost unfair that the same squad stays in its current division despite the obvious success the program enjoys year in and year out. Naugatuck is usually a top contender in Class L. Woodland, Seymour and Holy Cross were all in the Class S playoffs last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brass Division</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Crosby</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Derby</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Oxford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*St. Paul Catholic</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Torrington</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Waterbury Career Academy</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Wilby</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The Falcons are where they should be in the Brass Division, competing against programs they can battle against with some success. St. Paul Catholic might be a bit on the small side in terms of numbers, but the squad is never an easy out since becoming a member of the NVL in 2009.</p>
