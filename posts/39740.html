<p>I’m chomping at my “Bits” with today’s feature segment. It’s the topic of “Whatever became of so and so.” So and so in this case is Scott Lachance, who was born in Virginia in 1972 and grew up in Bristol, played hockey and was chosen fourth in the 1991 NHL draft. He is now the top individual for the U.S. Scouting for the Edmonton Oilers, a fellow who had played 818 professional games himself. He’s married to Jacqueline Parker, whose father, Jack, was his college coach.</p>

<p>They had three sons, now all in their 20’s, Jake, Ryan and Shane, each who also grew up smacking pucks. Jake ended his career at Wesleyan University in 2023 as NAHL player of the year. Ryan plays for The Freeze in the NAHL, and Shane is a forward for Boston University. Prior to college, he was selected 186th overall by Edmonton in the 2021 NHL draft.</p>

<p><strong>Old school sports terminology</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I first started writing, it was on the topic of sports. I enjoyed learning about some of Bristol’s best through earlier years, such as those from the 1920’s through 1940’s. And, in the games they played, sports writers used some “cool” words. For example: “Johnny Utke, Wally’s younger sibling, led the winning Celtics squad in scoring with nine points. Leading the way for the vanquished Bulls was the tilt’s leading point-maker Babe Reimer with a baker’s dozen.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some other old-time words were netted (scored), charity stripe or strip (foul line), counterparts (opposing team), campaign (season), circuit (league), gridiron (football field), whiff (a strikeout), booters (soccer team), harriers (cross country runners), and ducks (diving and swim team members.)</p>

<p>Sports writers were noted as being “scribes,” and they all got along. That was seen often when the CT Sportswriters Alliance members got together to honor the best in the state. Local men enshrined into their Hall of Fame were Joe Fontana of Southington, Thomas M. and Thomas R. Monahan of Bristol, and Plainville’s Ivan Woods.</p>

<p>Here are some of the mainstays from the Secret Santa Society, a group of volunteers who hold an annual Christmas party at our local regional Little League facility: Chairman -- Don Soucy; General Solicitor; Frank J. Johnson; and Event Coordinators -- Maryellen Holden, Karen Vibert and Linda Soucy. </p>

<p>I just wrote about the Anthony Savino, Sr., Family, and was unaware of his widow, Deanna, passing. My sincere condolences to this fine family!</p>

<p><strong>Oliver 'Ollie' Roberge</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of Bristol’s best athletes from yesteryear was Oliver Roberge, who lived at 46 Orchard St. here. He was a quiet, studious and well-rounded lad. He went to prep school instead of Bristol High. From there it was four years at Providence College in earning 10 varsity letters, those in football, basketball and baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He graduated in 1934 and was later inducted into his college hall of fame. What also impresses me is the fact that he and Lenny Wilkins were once the lone two scholar-athletes to be highly honored by the Friars in both sports and academics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can you imagine if he had gone to Bristol High? His high school teammates would have included Albie Gurske and Andy Palau, both three-sport all-staters!</p>

<p>In closing I say: “Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
