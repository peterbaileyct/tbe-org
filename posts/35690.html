<p>To the editor:</p>

<p>I am concerned that our current mayor, Jeff Caggiano is misleading the public. He touts that between and 250-500 new businesses sprouted up during this administration. Where are they? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't see any new brick and mortar stores, unless you count the vape shops (We have at least 15, not including convenience stores) How do those stores add to the quality of life here? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why isn't Mayor Caggiano at those ribbon cutting ceremonies? What about quick serve places, dining establishments and craft breweries? At least 13 of those have closed. Both craft breweries are closed as well. What did he do to help those businesses survive? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where are these new businesses? Are these people operating side jobs out of their home as they can't afford the new taxes that we were told were not going to happen during his first mayoral campaign? </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I heard our Mayor and city council is looking at a new location for another marijuana dispensary on Route 6. Less than 2 miles from the other one and a marijuana growing facility near downtown Bristol. Bristol can do better. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please vote for Scott Rosado for Mayor. He owns 2 businesses [in town and he employs over 500 people across Bristol and Connecticut) He is a leader, a veteran, former police commissioner and a trusted businessman, not a salesman. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three of our other council candidates own their own successful local businesses as well. Please join me in voting for Scott Rosado and the others on the ticket.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
