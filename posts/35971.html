<p>MIDDLETOWN - Generating a tie against a very strong team from Middletown was a feather in the cap of the boys soccer program at Bristol Eastern High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers and the Blue Dragons battled it out from Middletown High School as the squads ended the contest knotted in a 2-2 stalemate on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big showing by Eastern (8-4-2), battling another one-loss program from the CCC and coming away without a loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are now 8-4-2 overall while the Blue Dragons (6-1-7) have a state high seven ties on its 2023 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Across the board, it was a gutsy effort from all the Lancers,” said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. “Playing our third game in four days, and against the CCC-South leader tonight, we battled to the final whistle.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got on the scoreboard first as a very familiar goal-scoring machine got right to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the first half, Eddie Ansah was able to convert a Sam LaMar throw-in at 37:14, making it a 1-0 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Middletown’s Andrew Lazich tied the game just under five minutes later, sending a hard shot into the Eastern net with 32:35 left to play in the first period. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Kingstreeters had another response to regain the edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Landon Gawel touched the ball to Lucas Tylicki in the middle of the Middletown penalty area. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Tylicki knocked it home for a 2-1 Lancers’ lead with 29:28 showing on the clock - a cushion that nearly held into the half. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 2:35 remaining in the first, Lazich notched his second goal of the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scored out of a scramble in front of the Eastern goal to tie the match up at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That would be the final score of the showdown though both teams had chances to score a game-winning goals over the final forty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second half, Eastern had a few breakaways, but for the majority of the time, the squad gave ground, but the Lancers’ excellent defense stopped Middletown outside of the penalty area. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s starting goalie, Peyton Cummings, was injured in the first half after a collision with a Middletown player but his replacement, Connor Murtaugh, was steady in the net and made two outstanding saves to help preserve the tie over an impressive stint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rio Fernandez, Leslie Adzo, and Jess Portillo were especially sharp shutting down some dangerous players,” said Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown keeper, Tyler Hahn, made four saves while Cummings had six and Murtaugh added five to preserve the stalemate. &nbsp;</p>
