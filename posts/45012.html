<p>Logan Rembish picked up his third win of the season leading the St. Paul Falcons to a 5-1 win over the Canton Warriors in Bristol Saturday afternoon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rembish allowed only one run on two hits while striking out seven. Michael Archangelo was the hard luck loser as four Canton errors led to four unearned runs in the first 2 innings. Archangelo also struck out seven on the day.</p>

<p>St. Paul scored its first run in the bottom of the first inning without the benefit of a hit. Cal Chance walked. When Chance attempted to steal second, the ball was thrown into the outfield allowing Chance to go to third, and then the return throw went to the backstop allowing Chance to score.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the second, Seth Meuer led off with a double. Brian Anderson then sacrificed Meuer to third. Mike DeRosa tapped the ball back to the pitcher, and Meuer was caught in a run down. But the ball was dropped allowing Meuer to return to third while DeRosa reached first safely. </p>

<p>Jay DeRosa then got the bunt down to squeeze home Meuer while his brother advanced to second. Keaton Kroll followed with a triple to left field scoring DeRosa. And Kroll scored when a routine ground ball was mishandled. St. Paul led 4-0 after two innings. </p>

<p>St. Paul added one more in the bottom of the fourth. Kroll walked and advanced to third on Coby Dagata's single. AJ Corrado's RBI single brought home Kroll and made it 5-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Canton earned its run in the top of the sixth. Ian Clark singled and Sammy Lincoln walked to start the inning. That ended Rembish's day on the mound, and he was relieved by Brian Anderson. Clark and Lincoln each moved up a base on Noah Asmar's groundout, and Clark scored on Nate Hiscox's groundout. The final score was 5-1.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
