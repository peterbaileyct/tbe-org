<p>Board of Finance chair John E. Smith has officially stepped down as chair and the board has voted member David Maikowski as the new chairs at its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday. Maikowski will take over as chair at the next Board meeting on June 27.</p>

<p>Earlier in the May 23 meeting, Fire Chief Richard Hart expressed his gratitude to Smith for his years of service and presented Smith with his own fire hat and commissioner's shirt.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano took time at the end of the meeting to thank Smith for not only all heâ€™s done on the board but also everything he's done for the city since 1969. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to acknowledging Smith for his years of service, Hart presented the monthly report for the fire department. As part of his presentation, Hart requested approval on a bid waiver to Pierce Manufacturing Inc. for a firefighting apparatus. </p>

<p>The original bid for a motor needed for the apparatus increased by $60,000. The engine in question was previously approved by the Board of Finance and is due 19 months from when they sign the intent of purchase.</p>

<p>The Board of Education requested an additional appropriation of $45,000 under the Capital Projects -- Schools Fund, which was approved. There also was a bid waiver to TinaRose Produce approved for $375,000; however, that purchase order is expected to potentially change since there are only a few weeks of the school year left.</p>

<p>The Tax Collector's office requested a transfer of $2,254,270 of uncollectible taxes to the Municipal Suspense List, which was approved. In addition, for various departments, there was an approval of transfers totaling $912,990 within the Equipment Building Sinking Fund.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
