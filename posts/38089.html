<p>BRISTOL - Name a better linebacker around than Bristol Eastern senior Adam Zavecz?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m waiting…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot, 200 pound halfback/linebacker/running back/fullback was Mr. Everything for the Lancers in 2023 and this squad doesn’t get near a .500 ledger without his contributions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s as good of a linebacker as we’ve seen all year,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius of Zavecz. “He was a great leader for us all year long.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The athlete, who wasn’t just a jack of all trades but a master at just about everything he did, was everywhere on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when No. 7 was at his best, he was suplexing - or frankly throwing - opponents to the turf from Alumni Field at BEHS or at several opposing fields around the Central Connecticut Conference area - and New Haven when the need arose - defensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played like a guy that was 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds and was the Eastern leader in tackles, nabbing more than a couple games of double-digit tackling totals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[He’s] physical, set the tone for us,” said Julius.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether it was defense or offense, Zavecz left his mark in all 10 games he played in - helping the Lancers to a 6-4 record, the best ledger since 2014 when the squad went 7-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His offense came in spurts but when Zavecz was part of the schemes in terms of running the football, the athlete gobbled up some serious yardage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, he averaged 7.4 yards-per-carry but this year, he increased that tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz was third in carries (26), second in total yardage (236) and the team leader in yards-per-carry (9.1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second half of the season alone, Zavecz averaged 13.1 yards-per-carry, scooping in both his TDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had the longest rush of the campaign (79 yards versus Hartford Public) and captured a 38-yard fourth period carry that kept Hillhouse from getting the ball back with any serious time on the clock in Eastern’s 2-0 road win against Hillhouse during Week Three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz also tallied three receptions for 44 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a tremendous defensive component when he wasn’t spending all that time on offense as Zavecz proved to be a hard player to keep off the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zavecz added 73 tackles to the till - the team leader in that category - while second on the squad in tackles for a loss (9.5 tackles for a loss of 19.5 yards).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Farmington in Week One of the season, the senior tallied two inceptions - capturing 59 yards - and ran in both balls in for touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second straight season Zavecz had multiple pickoffs against Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thanksgiving, Zavecz led the team in tackles with 10 and had a half tackle for a loss along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He had another great game again today [with] double-digit tackles,” said Julius about Zavecz’s effort on Thanksgiving. “He’s a hell of a player.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Zavecz&nbsp;was one of the reasons why opponents averaged just 10.4 points-per-game and completed only 28-percent of its third down chances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past two seasons, Zavecz has been an all-around standout for the Eastern program - deserving All-State recognition and any postseason award he’s eligible for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re going to miss him a lot” next season said Julius. “I’m happy with the season that he had. He worked really, really hard and it showed all year long, right from the first game. He kind of set the tone for us and we followed his lead.”</p>
