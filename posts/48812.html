<p>I was touched to hear that Dr. Gerald Jensen recently passed on at age 97. My three kids went to him in their early years. Whose kids hadn’t?!  A multi-faceted individual, he was well-known in this community.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pediatrician was also an organist and choir master. One solid and giving fellow, he was a true Bristol icon. My friend, Lorette Couette, had him as a pediatrician:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was a good doctor, and also made a fine presence on the (musical) stage. I remember that he wore a tie at the concerts he was taking part in.” </p>

<p>Ray passed away this month at age 97, and was a man who really made his life a wonderful experience for himself. I’ve always enjoyed crossing paths with him. A WWII Navy veteran, he loved sports, taking on senior play with his golf, tennis and skiing with success.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray was delighted a few years ago when he was inducted into the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame. I recall how much that meant to him.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised on Tuesday afternoon when I received a phone call from Keith Freeman, a former sports editor at The Bristol Press. His staffers were Joe Bilodeau and the late Jack Lautier. I was a correspondent for Keith, who now lives out West.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keith and I chatted for nearly an hour, and during this time he asked me about Donovan Clingan. He was familiar with UConn’s success the past two seasons, and that he was now with the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was close to him shortly at a Portland game,” he told me. "What is he like?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I bragged about Donovan and said that he would likely talk to him, because he was in Bristol at one time, especially when he had written about his mom in high school here, while following her in college at the University of Maine. We talked about many Bristol topics and agreed to get on the phone sometime down the road.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keith’s call made my day!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Keith - Part 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also asked me about Dave Mills who coached his son, Steve. Keith always liked the father and son duo. In fact, Keith and I traveled to Yale together to see Steve play in recording one fine game that day as the Bulldog’s quarterback. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was surprised that many grammar schools were turned into apartment complexes, and how the landscape for our schools had been updated.</p>

<p><strong>Softball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope to look into softball here, especially fast-pitch. This is a future endeavor of mine with guys like Paul Tonon and Sal Amenta playing around here. Sal was also a champion in duckpin bowling here, another future topic.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
