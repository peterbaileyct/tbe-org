<p>Come Sunday morning, things will be quieter around the city since CT Open House Day activities will have subsided. Saturday the parking lot at the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum was filled, and I am thinking from what I saw, not a few of the cars parked on Woodland Street were also there to take advantage of free admission as part of the statewide initiative to get Connecticutters to experience the wonderful resources all around us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Bristol’s case, there are a few special places, such as the Clock &amp; Watch Museum and the Carousel Museum, just down the street or across town. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, Bristol celebrated its cultural district designation with another event on the Federal Hill green. Music filled the air for participants celebrating the city’s designation from the Connecticut State Department of Economic and Community Development. Vendors lined up, offering live paintings, caricatures, poetry and other art.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event was hosted by the City of Bristol Department of Park, Recreation Youth and Community Services along with the City&nbsp;Arts and Culture Commission and promises to be the first of many celebrations promoting resources and cultural offerings right here in the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, of course, Bristol experienced the fallout (literally, smoke) from wildfires that are burning and eating up forests in Canada, raising the AQI (Air Quality Index) from a good day of 15 to a terribly bad day with a score as high as 174. I can’t imagine what it was like (and is like since the fires are still burning across the border)&nbsp;if these fires were burning just around the corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it was, we closed our windows and considered wearing masks as a precaution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around the house, the rhododendrons have blossomed, and the petals are strewn over the lawn. Tucked behind them are the mountains laurels, also in bloom, which is a treat. I have admired these evergreen shrubs and the state flower in all its white and pink glory on walks down to the Boulevard and over by the hospital. They won’t be around but a minute. Check them out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading this week – Of course, former President Donald Trump has been indicted for his involvement with classified documents. There are plenty of articles circulating. I advise ignoring opinion columns and sticking to news reports about the indictments and the information they contain to get an idea about the actual charges and what they involve. Otherwise, it’s too easy to listen to the noise surrounding them and get lost in that. If you are skeptical of U.S. news media reports, try bbc.com.

<p>Listening this week: I returned to the Lex Fridman Podcast with guest Harvard professor Randall Kennedy who published "N****: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word." It is, to say the least, a controversial subject for a conversation that raises challenges on so many different levels. This is the 20th anniversary of the publication of the book.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
