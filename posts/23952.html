<p>While it may not be the prime season for traffic cones, on any given day in Bristol, you could encounter them on Bristol’s roadways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are used to “channelize” road users, divide lanes, divert traffic in construction zones, and warn drivers of unknown hazards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Believe it or not, when it comes to laying out traffic cones on roads, it is not just some random, haphazard method. There are standards and approved uses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), established federal guidelines and standards for safety purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the most commoners are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Cones shall be predominantly orange and shall be made of a material that can be struck without causing damage to the impacting vehicle.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For daytime and low-speed roadways, cones shall be not less than 18 inches in height.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When cones are used on freeways and other high-speed highways or at night on all highways, or when more conspicuous guidance is needed, cones shall be a minimum of 28 inches in height.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>For nighttime use, cones shall be retro reflectorized or equipped with lighting devices for maximum visibility.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are about 140 million traffic cones in use today, and they are used on roadways, parking lots, athletic fields, and any place where caution is necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will be not only in the midst of pothole season but also traffic cone season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spring means widening roads, milling, paving and other road related projects that may impact a drivers commute. And while commuters may be delayed, they are reminded to slow down and allow roadworkers and contractors room to do to their jobs safely. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
