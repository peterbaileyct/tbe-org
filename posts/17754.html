<h3>Sept. 30</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sept. 30, 1898, Bristol held a peace celebration for the Bristol boys returning from the Spanish American War.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beginning at 1 p.m. a parade started from Main to North Main to Maple and to the green. The honorable Joseph R. Hawley and Colonel Norris C. Osborn addressed the assembled crowd.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dinner was at 5:30 p.m. and at 7:30 p.m. the most elaborate fireworks display ever given in Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
