<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Bristol Central golf team had a great showing at the 2022 Boys Division I Golf Championship from Stanley Golf Course in New Britain on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a team, Central shot a combined 352 which was 48 strokes off Fairfield Prep’s winning mark of 304.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cheshire was the runner up for the Division I title, sinking in a 312 – eight strokes behind Fairfield Prep – while Daniel Hand (323) also had a good day on the greens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a stellar performance at the CCC Championships, Central junior Scott Petrosky had a tremendous day on the course – tying for third overall by carding a 73, just two over par (71).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an excellent finish by the local talent as the golfer was tremendous over his first nine holes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky tallied three birdies, sinking three shots all one-under-par, and while he had a bogey on the seventh hole, he was still two-under through nine (34).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He faced a little trouble over the back nine but managed another birdie on the 18th to salvage the final hole and made a top-three finish after a very good outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky’s 73 was four shots off the medalist’s final tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Rothberg from Fairfield Prep shot a two under for the day (69) to win the individual Division I title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Joe Pikiell carded an 87 while Carson Rivoira and Tyler Wilson both nabbed scores of 96.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Umar Malick wasn’t included in the official scoring but ended up carding a 101 from the Division I Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell dropped a birdie in the fourth hole and was just eight-over-par through the first nine holes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson was five shots ahead of Rivoira over the first nine holes but the boys basketball state champion shot a 46 over the back nine and tied with Wilson in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a really good season for Petrosky and the Central golf team under the leadership of head coach Tim Barrette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Petrosky has been a big part of that success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the recent CCC Boys Golf Tournament Championship on June 2, the Central program finished in fourth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Petrosky shot a 73 to take runner-up honors at the ultra-competitive event and off that showing in the Division I title tilt, his postseason continues into the weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-State talent will compete at the State Open on Saturday from the Black Hall Club in Old Lyme on Saturday, June 11.</p>
