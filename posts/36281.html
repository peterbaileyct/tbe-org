<p>It’s bounce back time for the Bristol Eastern football program with a special Saturday showdown against RHAM in Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last two contests between the squads were wild and woolly affairs as each team stole a game from the other’s home turf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And why stop that tradition now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Raptors are going to be a tough out but if Eastern quarterback Kamden Laprise can continue his stellar play and the running game -- fueled by senior Jaiden Fore -- gets back on track, the home team is going to have its collective hands full.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the deal for Saturday:</p>

<p><strong>Time: </strong>Saturday, High Noon (RHAM turf field, Hebron)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series: </strong>This is the fifth game for the Lancers against the Raptors with all the showdowns coming as members of the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Series Edge: </strong>The series is tied 2-2 with Eastern winning its last showdown at RHAM back on Sept. 17, 2021 -- a 13-7 triumph. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season: </strong>The two squads squared off on Week 1 to open the 2022 campaign. RHAM trailed 20-0 at the half but ended up seizing a 23-20 come from behind victory back on Sept. 9. Rayshon Andrews rushed for two touchdowns but had two others called back due to penalties, costing the Lancers in the end. Andrews made a half-dozen carries for 97 yards. Fore’s junior season debut saw him roll up 67 yards on a team-high 12 carries.   </p>

<p><strong>Last Week: </strong>RHAM fell to South Windsor by a 13-6 final last Friday while Eastern dropped a tough 7-6 decision at home to Platt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect: </strong>The Raptors have already filled its quota of tough losses this season and the Lancers would like to add to those miseries…Through three periods in its last game against South Windsor, RHAM trailed 7-6 (sound familiar?) until a critical pickoff turned the ultimate tide of the contest…South Windsor’s Logan Sherwood made a 25 yard TD interception return midway through the fourth period to net the game-winning points and foil the Raptors…RHAM quarterback Jordan Weers threw an 18-yard TD pass to Mason Little for the squads only score of the game…RHAM did a great job moving the ball, capturing 13 first downs while possessing the pigskin for nearly 27 minutes…While the QB can toss the ball, there’s a solid running component so expect a lot of play action in Hebron…Eastern lost its two games this season by eight total points -- a mere touchdown and two-point conversion away from a perfect season. But that’s what happens in scholastic football…The Lancers’ defense has been tremendous this year, shutting out two opponents and, just last week, allowing seven points and holding a good throwing quarterback (4-for-9, 65 yards) to minimal yardage…Adam Zavecz tallied 11 tackles with 2.5 of those going for losses while Bryce Bacote nabbed five tackles…Randy Denoto had a huge sack while Mikey Sherrill, Ryan Zavecz and Hunter Wells all made tackles for losses to keep the Panthers from scoring a second time…And don’t forget the Alex Corvo interception, keeping Platt from an early incursion into the red zone…Eastern took chances throughout the contest and, credit to the Platt defense, the visitors did just enough to slow down the offense…Laprise made eight passes for 93 yards and rushed for another 30 -- attempting to carry the offensive load and did yeoman's work throughout the game…The rushing schemes were halted a bit (27 carries, 80 yards) by the Platt defense. However, if Laprise can duplicate that throwing effort and the ground crew could make some gains, Eastern has a good chance to tally a win at RHAM…Remember what happened the last time we went to Hebron back in 2021? It was a wacky 13-7 victory for the Lancers in a game in which the Raptors appeared to have scored at the buzzer -- tying the score. But a clock malfunction -- after a discussion by the officials -- nullified the score as time truly had expired…What will happen in the rematch from Hebron on Saturday? Well, fill up your gas tank (put in premium. Live a little), enjoy one final day of great weather, and we’ll see you at the pay window at RHAM. </p>
