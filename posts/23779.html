<p>ROXBURY, MA - A couple of Bristol’s finest athletes battled it out from the 35th Annual New England Interscholastic Indoor Track &amp; Field Championship on Saturday, March 4 from the beautiful Reggie Lewis Center just outside of Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern had representatives at the event, establishing new school records over their stacked and competitive events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Frankie Porrini was a part of the proceedings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned a spot in the 1600-meter event, a race he already held the school record for at BCHS and ended up securing a new personal best after his finish on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini brought home a new school record as well, finishing the race in 4:23.41 - good for 12th place overall in the one-mile challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Central head coach Kiara Bonilla, Porrini took over his heat of the 1600 meters with three laps to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a quick time despite running the majority of the race by himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini earned his trip to Roxbury with his tremendous finish at the Connecticut State Open back on February 18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior came in fifth place overall at the Open, ending the race in 4:24.10 while two weeks later, Porrini made his old record history in Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini had an eventful winter scholastic campaign that included a nod as GameTimeCT’s Male Athlete of the Week to open the 2023 calendar year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the Hillhouse Holiday Invite, he took first place in both the 1000 (2:36.82) and 1600 meters (4:29.82) and then at the Hillhouse Developmental Meet, Porrini had another banner day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He won the mile event in 4:36.30 and then captured the 3200 meters with a time of 10:12.04 to complete a busy afternoon of events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern’s Jack Mulcunry also had a day in Roxbury</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then for the Lancers at the New England’s, it was senior Jack Mulcunry establishing a new school record in the 600 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The indoor record holder for the Lancers reestablished his outstanding time with a seventh-place finish in 1:23.02.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luke Pacheco of Shelton (1:22.81) was the only other runner from Connecticut to beat out Mulcunry’s finish that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Clegg from Londonderry, New Hampshire won the 600 meters with a time of 1:21.64.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on February 18, Mulcunry finished the 600 meters at the Connecticut State Open in fifth place with a time of 1:24.22, punching his ticket for the New England event in Boston.</p>
