<p>Last Tuesday night at Plymouth Town Hall, 20 people, mostly Bristol residents, attended an information meeting regarding Covanta’s application to burn medical waste at its trash-to-energy plant on Enterprise Dr.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State Senator Henri Martin of the 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;district organized the meeting due to health concerns expressed by his constituents. Dr. Paul Gilman, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President for Covanta, attended and provided information and answered questions from those in attendance. In July, via Zoom, a similar meeting took place.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sen. Martin made introductory remarks before yielding to questions and comments. Former state representative candidate Dave Rackliffe voiced his concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The permit application is very complete, very thorough,” Rackcliffe said. “But as you read through it, some questions really jumped out at you. A lot of it has to do for me with the tonnage and the amount of waste that was going to be burned in Bristol.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rackcliffe said he felt it was unacceptable only to advise the public through city council meetings, “To say that that was adequate communication to the general population, I think this is erroneous, and they paid the price.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is worth noting that in the fall of 2018, Covanta went before at least ten different boards and commission to fulfill their environmental justice requirements for the permit and keep the boards, commissions and public in the loop. Additionally, Cheryl Thibeault, now a City Councilwoman, once worked for Covanta and was on the Board of Finance when the host fee agreement came through boards and commissions.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other piece that Bristol was involved with concerned modifying the host community fee. The previous administration negotiated an increase in what Covanta paid the city based on the host community status, upwards of $300,000. The agreement stipulated that the city would not sanction anatomical or fetal waste.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Covanta’s permit seeks to bring medical waste to the Bristol facility from seven other states, and they believe Bristol is the best suited to accomplish this. “We look for a good operating facility and a good location where there is demand for the service. And the Bristol facility is a good location and a good facility that runs well,” Gilman said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Gilman also addressed the company’s 2015 OSHA citation for workplace safety and health standards violations, which resulted in an $80,000 fine. “The safety violations were largely attributable to the electrical systems in the facility. A number of electrical system modifications had been done and were not done properly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biomedical waste coming to Bristol will be generated from clinics, labs, and hospitals. Sen. Martin read a list of allowable materials to be burned in the incinerator, which includes: gauze, beddings, gowns, dressings, needles, syringes, scalpels, IV bags, tubing, catheters, vials, residual medicines, tissue samples on slides, personal protective equipment, curtains, gloves, residual vaccines, and vials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also noted the inappropriate materials, those not to be included under the plan: anatomical waste, cadavers, human fetal tissues, bulk therapeutic waste, pharmaceutical waste, and anything that’s radioactive material.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2014, Marion County Commissioners in Portland, Ore., ordered a waste-to-energy facility to stop receiving medical waste from British Columbia when they discovered that they might have been burning fetal tissue, cancerous tissue, and amputated limbs to generate power.</p>

<p>Covanta won the New Jersey Business and Industry Association’s (NJBIA) Excellence for Community Service from the New Jersey Business and Industry Association in 2019. The NJBIA is an annual award that acknowledges outstanding businesses and their leaders who have improved New Jersey’s economic climate and quality of life.</p>

<p>Despite invites to DEEP and Bristol municipal leaders, the only Bristol government representative from the state or municipal level in attendance was Sen. Martin. (Bristol had the Board of Finance Meeting and Diversity Council meetings the same evening.) The state senator remarked that this is not just a Bristol issue but a regional one. Additional information sessions are scheduled for Bristol, Plainville, Wolcott, and Southington in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
