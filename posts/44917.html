<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>May is loaded with goodies for Pokémon Go! From the Mythical Pokémon Diancie to the Alolan guardian Tapu Fini, we have a lot to cover for this month, and I’ll give you the scoop on how to catch them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new Special Research story Glitz and Glam will be available to all Trainers for free. It started yesterday, Wednesday, May 1, at 10 a.m., and if you have one already, you’ll get more candies for Diancie. Trainers who complete the Special Research will earn an encounter with the Mythical Pokémon Diancie. This Special Research will not expire, so you’ll be able to complete it at your own pace!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, the finale of the World of Wonder event has been released! This month, you’ll research Poison-type Pokémon from both our world and Ultra Space. You will have an opportunity to catch an additional Poipole. Trainers can claim their rewards for completing the Wonder Ticket Timed Research tasks at any point until June 14, at 8 p.m.</p>

<p>During May Mega Alakazam, Mega Gyarados and Mega Pidgeot raid bosses will be available in Pokémon GO's Mega Raids at different times. All of them can be Shiny. From May 2 to 16, Mega Alakazam will appear in Mega Raids. From May 16 to 23 Mega Gyarados will appear in Mega Raids. The Tapu Fini Raid Hours take place at 6-7 p.m. on May 8 and 15. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To take part in 5-Star Raids, you need to use a Raid Pass – you pick these up from a Gym once a day. You'll be able to take Tapu Fini on alone or as part of a team. Fail and you can try again as often as you can within an hour timeframe. Here are the known hot spots to find them:</p>

<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.<br>Bushnell Park, Hartford</p>

<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we ready ourselves for the rest of the raids and some more Ultra Beast in the World of Wonders event! For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pokemongolive.com">www.pokemongolive.com</a>. Until next time Trainers!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
