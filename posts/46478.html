<p>Propelled by an eight-run fifth inning, the H-K Cougars defeated the St Paul Falcons 9-3 Saturday afternoon at Haddam-Killingworth High School. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reliever Ryan Erskine was the winning pitcher allowing no runs and only one hit over the final three innings while striking out five. Reliever Logan Rembish took the loss for St. Paul.</p>

<p>St. Paul scored the first two runs of the game in the top of the third inning. Keaton Kroll was hit by a pitch to start the inning, and was out at second when Cal Chance grounded into a fielder's choice. Coby Dagata singled to put two men on, and AJ Corrado brought them both home with a two RBI double to the left field fence. </p>

<p>After failing to score in the first four innings, the H-K offense exploded for eight runs in the bottom of the fifth. Matt Shea was hit by a pitch to start the inning and advanced to third on Max Selmer's single. That ended Kyle Wilson's day on the mound, and Logan Rembish came in in relief. </p>

<p>After singles by Chase Bruno, Blake Kamoen and Luke Mauri, a double by Colton Merola, and sacrifice flies by Ryan Erskine and Todd Butler, H-K led 5-3. Matt Shea then capped off the inning with a three-run homer over the center field fence and H-K led 8-3 after five innings.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
