<p>Dr. Catherine Carbone, superintendent of Bristol Public Schools, will retire after 35 years in education and six and a half years as assistant superintendent and superintendent here in Bristol, it was announced by Bristol Board of Education chair Shelby Pons in a release Saturday evening.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carbone announced her decision the previous evening, according to Pons, who thanked Carbone for her service and, speaking on behalf of the board, expressed gratitude to Carbone for her contributions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"She led the development of the Reimagining BPS 2023 Plan, which aimed to make the district more equitable and efficient," Pons writes. "Dr. Carbone also oversaw the opening of two new schools, the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School and Edgewood Pre-Kindergarten Academy."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Pons writes, "The Board also notes that Dr. Carbone guided the district through a global pandemic and managed an influx of federal and state funding to help the district succeed academically."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An interim superintendent will be appointed in the coming days, Pons writes, and the search for a successor will begin immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In conducting that search, we will be seeking input through community forums, and we will appreciate hearing perspectives of parents, teachers, administrators, and other members of the school community on the qualities we should seek in a successor superintendent," Pons writes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selection of a superintendent is one of the most important duties boards of education have, and a diligent search will take time, she says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal is to have identified a successor by the beginning of the new school year, according to Pons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In the interim," she writes, "we wish to assure the Bristol school community that the quality instruction provided by our great teachers and as supported by our administrators and the entire staff of the Bristol Public Schools will continue without interruption."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
