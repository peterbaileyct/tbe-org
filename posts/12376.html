<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have attended another Hartford Stage production, this time Neil Simon’s Lost in Yonkers, starring Marsha Mason, who also co-directed. She was terrific, as was the entire production. The semi-autobiographical play takes place in Yonkers, when a dad has to deal with some extenuating circumstances from a loan and leaves his two boys with their grandmother, the dad’s mother, and her other children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am still a bit crowd-shy, since by all accounts, we are still dealing with a highly contagious virus, and perhaps another strain—over the past week I am acquainted with at least five new cases of people I see daily. But Hartford Stage checks vaccination cards and requires masking, so I feel fairly confident when I attend productions; on the other hand, I am a bit conflicted over this: the audiences have been between a quarter to a third full, which makes me feel better but does not help with receipts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way I am grateful for having such a wonderful theater so close, and, yes, there is nothing like live theater. &nbsp;</p>

<p>And something to note: I don’t know how many years ago it was, I could count but won’t, Mary and I, for our first date, went to a Neil Simon movie, The Goodbye Girl, starring Marsha Mason. This time around, as empty nesters, we are back where we started, attending another Neil Simon production starring Marsha Mason.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last Sunday, I watched the UConn women in another NCAA championship, one in which they fell short, playing their hearts out against a very talented and taller South Carolina. I can’t believe that was just a week ago. I didn’t even attempt to stay awake for the men’s final. And, as far as national sports goes, baseball season is upon us. Every time I call my mom, most afternoons, there has been excitement in the air, especially since her favorite basketball player, Steph Curry, is injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is spring break for schools, and the one thing I am looking forward to, aside from some downtime, is a trip to Tommy’s on Stafford Ave. I will have to report back. </p>

<p>Regarding TBE business, we are slowly raising funds needed to hire reporters to cover city hall. So whatever you can do to help support us would be great; small or large, it doesn’t matter as long as it is something. I have written in some of our promotional material about costs that we have incurred and will continue to incur. The one thing I have not mentioned, and will now, is that all of our stories have been produced without paying anyone. That needs to change if we are going to expand our coverage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We love doing what we are doing, but from the beginning the idea has been to create a community news venue that provides real quality local coverage, coverage that our community will recognize and support—because better information, more pertinent information makes a difference to what we are and can become as a whole. The way to recognize this effort and help us get closer to this goal of complete coverage of our community is to help fund us.&nbsp;It only takes a minute, by clicking <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> to return to our homepage and hitting the “Beecome A Member” or “Donate” button.&nbsp;</p>
