<p>It was a tremendous day for the Bristol Central girls track and field team from the 90th Greater Hartford Track and Field Invitational in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Kylee Barnes - a sensational sophomore - tied the school record in the high jump, making a leap of five feet, four inches.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Central coach Kiara Bonilla, she not only tied the school standard but Barnes won the event in East Hartford as well.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The high jump record is now shared by three athletes at Central.</p>

<p>In 2013, Lauren Bossi - who is all over the records books at BCHS - squared up 5-4 as did Shy Ann Whitten in 2018.</p>

<p>Also at the event, Central’s Gabriella Naranjo finished the 100 in 13.25 seconds, good for eighth place and made the same placing in the 200 (8th, 27.69 seconds).</p>
