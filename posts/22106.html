<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern wrestling team, under the direction of head coach Todd Krolikowski, has been battling and competing, but that first CCC South victory has remained elusive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have certainly given their opponents fits but, just like in its most recent contest at Platt - a tough 52-27 defeat on Wednesday night - that win just hasn’t materialized.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had good results up and down the line-up which included Xavier Rozie at 120 pounds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended his night by picking up a pin-fall victory in 3:11 over Nathaniel Ortiz to get his squad six points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple forfeits helped the Panthers along the way but at 152 pounds, the Lancers Rocco Barbino (152) earned a big win via decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barbino nabbed a 12-8 decision over Platt’s Demonte Preston while the Kingstreeters were successful over several of its heavyweight bouts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 182, Eastern’s Adam Zavecz was causing havoc on the mats once again, pinning Platt’s Emmanuel Lugo in just thirty seconds while teammate Owen Broyles (195) needed less than a period to sink his opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Broyles pinned Platt’s Michael Melendez in 1:40 and then at 220, Eastern’s Adoni Fernandez was able to topple Isaiah Smith (1:37) via pin-fall to earn his win to lead the Lancers.</p>

<p>This Wednesday, Eastern travels to Berlin for a CCC South meet at 6 p.m. from the Jim Day Gymnasium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
