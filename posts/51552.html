<p>Someone is writing a dull love story about a City Hall employee who, went not protecting us from earthquakes, is falling in love with the idea of strip-mining the Brazilian Rain Forest to make mid-level housing. The story is considered dull due to all the compound sentences. Too bad for Babycakes. </p>

<p>According to sources near the author, “The untitled work has no title.” Imagine that. Although movie reviewer Joe Bob Briggs swears it’s called “Give Me the View from 30,000 ft.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
