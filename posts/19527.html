<p>Hello there, Bristol. Good to see you after a weekend apart. Now, let’s get busy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Weather</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>72 and party cloudy. Mmm-mm, Finger licking good! A type of day where we could all find our inner Jacko Pastorius.</p>

<h3>Election Day</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomorrow is Election Day, so we can finally put away our election decorations.</p>

<h3>Inside the GMB</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A GMB staff member is writing a short story and it starts like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday, in the shade of a chestnut tree, I died and loved every second of it. Allow me to explain…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of the GMB staff…</p>

<h3>Inside the GMB Part II -- Feeling Ill</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of our GMB staff members fell ill briefly - then felt better, then felt bad, then was better again. All within the span of an hour and the hallmarks of a Lithuanian cold. This GMB staff member also got the side effect of increased height, so we had to increase the size of the doors at the TBE HQ.</p>

<h3>Scooby Doo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This would have been longer if it wasn’t for those meddling kids. See ya Tuesday and stay sexy Bristol.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
