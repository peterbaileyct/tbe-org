<p>The 2021-22 Connecticut High School Coaches Association All State Class L Girls Basketball team was recently released and, in no real surprise, Bristol Eastern senior standout Ciara Collins was named to the squad for the second consecutive season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Pace University bound Collins ended her career as one of the greatest female players ever to step on the court of the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins zipped up 1,531 career points - third all-time in the city of Bristol - and second to just Kathy Ferrier (1,563 points) at Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guard turned forward, and she’s truly a five-position player, managed to average just under 24 points and 11 rebounds-per-game for a very slick double-double this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the position ‘center’ would be applicable here was she grabbed 77 offensive rebounds over her 21 games - good for an average of 3.67 a game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of her best offensive rebounding game, Collins corralled nine offensive boards at Windsor in that overtime loss in December.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also blocked nearly 30 shots and was a defensive wiz, tallying just south of 3.0 steals-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins had so many standout games for the Lancers and when the rest of the squad struggled at times offensively, the senior did her best to put the team on her back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had one of the toughest Central Connecticut Conference’s schedules - playing elite teams and state title contenders almost on a nightly basis.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Collins hung with all those players, and whether it was putting up an amazing 20-20 game at Middletown or thrashing Hall for nearly 40 points, the senior standout simply did not have an off button.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing that didn’t allow Collins to capture the school’s scoring record - or the Bristol one for that matter - was the 10 games (or so) Eastern did not get to play due to COVID.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s been the leading game scorer for the program over two-plus seasons and before the final contest of the year, Collins led Eastern in scoring 35 straight times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s simply an amazing tally.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins led the squad this season in overall scoring, rebounding, assists, and steals – notching at least 12 points in every game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scooped up 12 double-doubles and dropped in three 3-pointers six times this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Collins notched five steals three different times this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then she systematically destroyed Hall over a sizzling mid-year performance - hitting 16-of-21 field goals for a career-high 38 points. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also collected three blocks and two steals over that showdown. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the way, Collins notched 32-plus points twice and put together an outstanding 21 rebound performance at Middletown - her career high.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Free throw shooting was her jam, and she leaves the program as one of its greatest marksmen, hitting 83-percent of her charity tosses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins had two games of perfect 10-for-10 free throw shooting while hitting 81-percent from the stripe overall this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, Collins was named CCC South All-Conference, making it four-for-four overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there are several big things to come for the standout hoopster to come on the collegiate level.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins is the third major player from Eastern to compete at Pace, along with Ginny Torreso (Ziogas) and Taylor Losey.&nbsp;</p>
