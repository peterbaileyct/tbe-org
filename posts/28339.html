<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When your scholastic baseball team shoots off to a 12-0 start, there’s probably a good chance the squad will have more than a couple all conference performers on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that was certainly true about the program over at Bristol Central this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, 15-7 overall in 2023, had some tremendous early season success and won a Class L first round state tournament game before bowing out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Bunty Ray had a talented group and four of his players were recently named to the CCC South All-Conference team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That grouping includes Senior Mike Allan, junior-transfer Joe Gratta, junior Nate Pirog and sophomore Aiden Lopez.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each one of those athletes contributed immensely to the 15-win program</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key ingredient to remember about the group was, in terms of offense, those players could be plugged anywhere in the lineup – being able to bat in position one through nine – and produce for the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at all four of Ray’s CCC South, All-Conference performers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Allan</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC_1235_Original-1024x764.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-28364" width="581" height="433"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mike Allan</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A defensive standout at shortstop, Allan played extremely well and was of the respected leaders of the program along with fellow senior All-Stater Frank Spirito.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Allan wasn’t making big plays in the infield, he was getting the job done from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allan batted a healthy .328 – several points over the team average of .264 – while enjoying a tremendous .403 on-base percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight walks helped his cause and he went a perfect 4-for-4 in stolen bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 21 hits and 19 runs led the program while also kicking in a double and triple along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allan certainly made a living with his nifty play at shortstop but his offensive abilities were certainly a big deal to the program as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three-sport star (soccer and basketball) will be hard to replace and remembered for his hustle and guile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lopez</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":28345,"width":581,"height":401,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0778-1024x707.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-28345" width="581" height="401"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aiden Lopez</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of basketball, Allan was joined by Lopez on the basketball team – starting several games – while providing a solid arm and bat for Ray’s squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore standout went 4-3 overall but there were some hard luck losses mixed in as his excellent 2.62 ERA would indicate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 34.67 innings pitched, he allowed just 13 earned runs while leading the program in strikeouts with 59.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents batted just .148 against the chucker – connecting on only 18 hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Lopez’s biggest win of the season came back on April 26 as he and Nick Krompegal went on to no-hit Platt over a 7-0 triumph in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez went on to pitch six of those innings while Krompegal mopped up in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One week previous, Lopez gave up three hits in Central’s 10-3 thrashing of Platt and while his pitching was near elite, his bat did a lot of talking as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the season, Lopez averaged one hit in every three at-bats – good for a .333 average, second on the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied 19 hits, including a double and a blazing triple against Plainville on April 7 in Central’s 2-1 win over the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez walked a team-leading 17 times and stole six bases along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With an on-base percentage of .474 while slugging the ball at a .386 clip, Lopez was a complete player for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pirog</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":28344,"width":725,"height":496,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_0777-1024x701.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-28344" width="725" height="496"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nate Pirog</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chucker was everything to the Central pitching staff this season, and more, leading the squad in innings pitched (48.67) when Spirito was hurt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started a program best eight games, leading to a stellar 4-2 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His ERA of 1.15 was an amazing number for the junior as well as his 52 strikeouts and 12 walks (4.3 K-to-BB ratio). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirog allowed just eight earned runs and went the distance five times this past spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He pitched a five hit shutout against Eastern the first time around on May 5 in Central’s 10-0 win in six innings from Muzzy Field as the Rams moved to a perfect 12-0 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the rematch between crosstown rivals on May 23, Pirog was a winner again in Central’s 7-1 victory – helping the program snap a six-game losing skid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went seven innings again, totaling nine strikeouts and allowing just six hits for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirog should be one of the featured pitchers for the team next season as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gratt</strong>a</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":28372,"width":560,"height":462,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DSC_1256_Original-1024x846.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-28372" width="560" height="462"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joe Gratta</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Central was humming this year, it was off the power of Gratta – a slick-wielding centerfielder – who was excellent from the leadoff position when the Rams were cruising and undefeated to start the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The transfer from Southington led Central with a .340 batting average – collecting a .493 on-base percentage that led the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gratta went 18-for-53 from the plate, scored 17 runs, smashed out two doubles and a team best four triples as his motor was one of the major reasons while he caught just about everything hit to him in center (remember the catch against Plainville?).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also added 11 walks, two sacrifices, nine RBI and four stolen bases – doing a little here and a lot there to push Central’s offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Out of the 26 batters hit by a pitch at Central this past season, Grata was plunked a team-leading seven times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to Gratta’s credit, he had a keen eye at the dish, striking out only six times this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that 10-3 win versus Platt, Gratta went 3-for-4 with a couple triples, setting the tone of the season he was about to have for his new school.</p>
