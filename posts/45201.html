<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team ended their 6 game home stand with a loss to perennial CCC power Farmington, 11-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the defeat, the Lady Lancers had several bright spots. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lancer goalie Erin Martin was phenomenal in goal with thirteen saves. Time after time Martin stopped Farmington players on point-blank shots.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively the Lancers were led by Meg Krok who had several key stops and checks to turn the ball over for the Lancers. Jayna Hatcher also stood out on defenses with several good clears and help defense. Both Krok and Hatcher had three ground balls to secure possession.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Leah Roy was again a difference maker in the mid-field, as she secured possession on the draw or scooping up five ground balls. Harper Dauphinee just missed on two goals with shots that chipped off the paint on the top of the cage, but she also had six ground balls.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ scoring was led by the senior duo of Emma Stavens and Vanessa Drury. Stavens led with four goals and an assist while Drury had two goals with an assist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BEHS hits the road Thursday against E.O. Smith at 3:45 with a record of 6-7. The Lancers are looking for that next win to secure a playoff berth.&nbsp;</p>
