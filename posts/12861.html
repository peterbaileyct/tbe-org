<p>BRISTOL - One week previous, the Bristol Eastern baseball program dropped a tough 12 run decision to Northwest Catholic in a CCC Interdivisional bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this past Friday afternoon, in a rematch against the Lions, the contest went in a different direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers were mere inches away from stealing a victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed by five runs but nearly drew even before falling by a 5-3 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest improved to 5-5 overall while Eastern fell to 3-6 with Bristol Central on deck on Monday (6:30 p.m., Muzzy Field).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions led 5-0 going into the bottom of the third tilt, thanks in part to a three-run second inning, before the Lancers scored a single run in the fifth and added two more in the seventh to narrow the gap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern was one hit away from a walk off win in the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was a rollercoaster ride to get there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern starter Ryan Maglio threw into the third inning but gave up those early five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first, Maglio hit the leadoff batter Vinny Muslauskas who promptly stole second. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After retiring the next two batters, Maglio issued a walk and nearly picked off Muslauskas at second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the rundown, Muslauskas ended up safe at third when the throw was dropped. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Culligan then hit Maglio's next pitch into left field for a base hit, scoring Muslauskas, to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the second, Northwest scored three times to snare a 4-0 push.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a walk, a single inside third base, and a sacrifice bunt saw all three the runners arrive safely as the bases were loaded with no outs. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muslauskas then singled between short and third for two runs, making it a 3-0 game. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next batter was hit by a pitch to re-load the bases and off one final groundout, notching another Northwest Catholic run, the Lancers trailed 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio fanned the final two batters of the second inning but the Eastern offense was unable to respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third with one out, singles by Northwest’s Ryan Micari and Luke Rice ended Maglio's day on the mound. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Nocera threw in relief but a wild pitch advanced both runners into scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk loaded the bases - all with no outs - and Maulauskas’s sacrifice fly scored Micari and the Lions were ahead on the scoreboard, 5-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But unlike that first showdown against Northwest, Eastern made a late comeback to nearly topple the Lions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nocera pitched scoreless ball for the next three innings, escaping a bases loaded jam in the fourth, to hold the fort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern’s Owen Myers came into throw in the seventh and despite allowing three walks to load the bases with one out, Northwest was unable to pad its lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Northwest starter Jonah Balcerak did well over his first four innings of work on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He gave up two singles to Ben D'Amato and an infield hit to Conor Cyr in the fourth for Eastern's only hits through four innings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Eastern fifth, the Kingstreeters finally tallied a run to get into the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole Latko beat out a slow grounder to shortstop with one out, taking second on a wild throw. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko moved to third on a groundout and scored on a wild pitch to make it a 5-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was still a four-run deficit for Eastern going into the seventh as Balcerak had thrown only 69 pitches, 49 for strikes (71-percent), fanning six with no walks through six frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then the bottom nearly fell out on the Lions in the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Balcerak issued a walk to Cyr to open the inning and then hit Conor McCormick and Latko with a pitch to load the bases with one out. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to Jaydon Churchill forced in a run, making it 5-2, and Balcerak was relieved by James Berry. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris then hit a grounder between third base and shortstop - and the race was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest shortstop Riley Carew fielded the ball, sprinting towards an unoccupied third base as Latko was doing the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko hustled out the play, arriving safely at third, as McCormick tagged the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Eastern trailed just 5-3, the bases were loaded, and the home team was a base hit away from tying up the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, Eastern’s Rio Fernandez came within inches of being a hero, slamming a liner to left that just went foul.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Fernandez flew out to left on the next pitch to end the game as Northwest hung on to win, 5-3.</p>
