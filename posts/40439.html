<p>When One Degree of Separation comes to the Rockwell Theater, it will perform not as an isolated show but at the fifth in a series of community wide-wide conversations that address issues of significance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Every year we look for new and innovative ways to engage our community by bringing families together," said Stephen Bynum, youth and community supervisor for Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services. "One Degree of Separation brings a different twist to conversation starters."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The conversation on Saturday will be about mental health, specifically suicide and depression--and the discussion will be handled with a sense of humor that only a group like One Degree of Separation might be qualified to take on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BPRYCS has been a driver behind the conversations since they began. Downtime Live programming is overseen by the BRPYCS Arts and Culture supervisor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our hope is that this message being given is one that helps identify resources, healthy coping strategies, ways to strengthen our Bristol families and continue to learn together to build our All-Heart City."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One Degree of Separation's message is a hopeful, Bynum said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It has opened the doors to where all community members can unite and learn not only how to debunk the myths, challenges and stigma of mental health," he said, "but to be able to listen and learn about resources together that helps to build the confidence to deal with difficult life events while understanding that you are not alone."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The show is only one part of the program, however. A brief discussion forum will follow the performance and then a half hour has been set aside for anyone seeking mental health services to consult with providers who will have stations set up in the theater itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The providers include National Alliance on Mental Illness, Bristol-Burlington Health District, Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Peaceful Mind, Behavioral Health and Wellness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This community conversation provides one more platform for Bristol residents to discuss an important topic, Bynum said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
