<p>BRISTOL - Win No. 8 for the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team came on Friday night as the Lancers battled Farmington in a huge CCC Interdivisional tilt in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it took a little time as the bigger River Hawks hung with the Lancers over the first 20 minutes of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern’s Taigan Parent drained three consecutive 3-pointers midway through the third tilt and once the Lancers established a double-figure edge in the game, Farmington never got back in contention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent dropped in a game-high 23 points as the senior standout made all the big shots, dropping pesky Farmington by a 57-41 decision from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the victory, the Lancers moved to 8-9 overall while the Red Hawks dropped to 5-12.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win also earned Eastern a trip back to the state tournament, a streak that started in 1996 as the Kingstreeters have been postseason participants every year since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a 34-33 game midway through the third quarter as Eastern was clinging to a small edge over Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from there, Parent (five three-pointers, two rebounds, six assists, two steals) blistered Farmington for nine straight points via 3-point bombs, Vanessa Drury added a hoop and when Autumn Udoh notched four points, it resulted in a slick 15-0 run as the Lancers nabbed a 49-33 cushion with around seven minutes left to play in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh, once again putting together video game-like statistics that night, was flirting with a quadruple-double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The freshman roped up 17 points, 11 rebounds, six blocks and six steals as Udoh did a little of everything that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury played extremely well, helping Parent direct traffic, as the junior guard wrapped up 12 points, six rebounds, six steals and three assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Leah Roy nabbed four points, nine rebounds and three assists, Amanda Noel snared three rebounds while Lauren Ayotte added two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington was led by Abby Bertolette who scored 20 points, notching nearly half the squad’s final scoring total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs held the lead early but off a jumper from Udoh and a 3 by Drury, the Lancers&nbsp;led 13-8 with 34 seconds remaining in the first frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was all tied up at 13-13 through one as Farmington's Leah McKenzie canned a three from the corner at the buzzer to knot things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the second, the River Hawks snared a five-point lead but a 7-0 Eastern burst, fueled by two Udoh free throws, a Parent jumper and a Drury three-pointer, gave Eastern a 25-23 edge with 1:50 remaining to play in the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after one final lay-in by Udoh, a steal that saw the first-year player go coast-to-coast for a big bucket, gave Eastern a 28-25 lead at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington was never able to catch-up over third period play and when it was 34-33 midway through the third, Parent simply went off from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury found Parent for two 3s, Roy dished off to the senior for the other trifecta, as the game was about to fall through the cracks for Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Parent made a steal, feeding Drury for a hoop, and Udoh ended the spurt by hitting two charity tosses as Eastern opened up a 47-33 lead with one quarter left to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh opened the final set with a turnaround jumper as Farmington trailed by 16 early in the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring, Roy cashed in on an offensive rebound and Parent concluded the fun with a jumper and two free throws as Eastern won by sixteen points to punch its playoff ticket with three games remaining on its regular season slate.&nbsp;</p>
