<p>Local veterans from American Legion Post 2 donated 22 handmade quilts recently to a pet blanket and towel drive being conducted by Bristol State Rep. Cara Pavalock-D'Amato (R-77) through June 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol veterans have been involved with several outreaches involving blankets and quilts, according the Neal Supranovich, Post 2 historian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of years ago a Post 2 member's mother and sister living in Maine began making dog blankets for animal hospitals in that state, Supranovich said. When they learned that once the blankets were soiled, the blankets were then thrown away they started donating the blankets to Post 2.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through a program in Post 2, working through contacts of Patti Mieiniczuk, dog blankets have been sent to a dog that was at ground zero on 911. Three were sent to dogs in combat areas, four to Service Dogs in Germany and a number stationed in the United States. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
