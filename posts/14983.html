<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2022 19U Connecticut American Legion State Tournament field is set and our squad from Bristol is in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The state was divided into Northern and Southern Divisions – meaning thirty-two teams make up the playoff field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All first round games commence this Saturday from the site of the higher seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as always, the tournament is a double-elimination format -- meaning Bristol (10-6 Zone 1) and every other team will get two games in the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 starts the postseason in Pod C along with Zone 6 winner Waterford (21-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Waterford is the top team in the pod and drew Zone 3’s Enfield (9-13) in a first-round showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is ranked second and gets an unbelievable draw as the squad starts play on Saturday against No. 3 Tri-County (10-11-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a rematch from opening day for Bristol as the two teams tangled from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tri-County, the only non-Zone 1 squad Bristol played this season, defeated Post 2 by a 9-4 final back on June 11 – which feels like a decade ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Zone 3 challenger will have to square off against Matt Beaucar (2-4 overall), one of Bristol’s top pitchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hope is that Enfield pulls off an upset against Waterford, meaning a chance for another game at home for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, Roberto Cruz – injured last Sunday in the sweep from Meriden – will be ready to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others in the rotation that could see time on the hill includes Dylan Woodsome, Jayden Churchill, Alexander Canzellarini, Tyler Martin, and Elliot Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the Northern Division, West Hartford – perhaps the top team in all of Connecticut – is the No. 1 team in Pod A, carrying an undefeated 16-0 Zone 1 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown (19-3) is rated first in the Pod B bracket and down in Pod D, Willimantic – the Zone 6 runner-up (20-4) – is the top program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other teams from Zone 1 in the Northern Division includes Torrington – ranked fourth in Pod B (5-11) – while Simsbury (6-10-1) is third in Pod D.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Meriden</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the Southern Division, Zone 2 runner up Hamden (12-6) is the top seed in Pod E and in Pod F, Zone 4 winner Stamford (18-6) is No. 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 2 winner West Haven (15-3) leads the charge in Pod G and in the final pod, Zone 4’s Danbury (16-8) is ranked first in Pod H.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of each pod then goes on to the Super Regional starting on Saturday, July 23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, it’s a double elimination format between two brackets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Muzzy Field and Palmer Field in Middletown will host the games and those two cities could see their American Legion squads advance to play on their own home sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winners from the "A" and "B’"brackets will then battle it out in a best-of-three challenge from Palmer Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That winner will be crowned the Connecticut state champs and head off to the New England Regionals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Northeast tournament takes place from Fitton Field in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts from August 3-7 and that winner advances to World Series play in Shelby, N.C.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eventual state champion from Connecticut has a ton of baseball to play – and win – just to qualify for the Northeast Regional.</p>
