<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MIDDLETOWN - This is a big weekend for the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 4-5-4, Post 2 has three home games from Muzzy Field with a make-up game in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol may not have a regular pitching staff this season in terms of full-time senior players but the 17U program has certainly provided a lift to the 19U team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re a little challenged on the mound” this year said Bristol Coach Jerry LaPenta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Colvin, Caleb Molinsky, Caleb Simard and Gabe White are two-way players for the program and have all helped the Seniors from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Declan Schenck is also a dual-rostered player who has shined at times at the 19U level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all those arms have helped Ryan Maglio - the team’s top chucker - along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio (3-0) has thrown a team-leading 21 innings while Jaydon Churchill, Connor Cyr, Josh Dunne and Isaac Roberge all have thrown some frames for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky is 1-1 on the Senior level and has been tremendous over his 11 innings pitched.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve got Caleb” on Friday said LaPenta of Molinsky. “Declan is available Friday and Maglio is available.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all arms on deck, Post 2 is going to have every chance to go 3-0 this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The weekend lineup</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The action starts on Friday at 7 p.m. against EHM (East Hartford, Manchester, Newington) in a Zone 3 tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad has lost 10 of 12 games this season while Post 2 battles NCL on Sunday at 11:30 a.m. before getting its rematch against Middletown (6-2) at 1 p.m. in the second game of a double dip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown against NCL is the continuation of a game from June 8 that was stopped due to curfew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest is all knotted up at 6-6 through 10 innings as Post 2 held a two-run edge late before letting it slip away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We play East Hartford and we’ve got to get that win,” said LaPenta of Friday’s 7 p.m. tilt. “We [also] finish the continuation of the 11-inning game [against Windsor Locks] that was suspended on Sunday morning before we play [Middletown].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest against NCL (5-6-1) is a must win for Post 2 if the program wants to stay in the playoff chase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got to get that win” against NCL said LaPenta. “We’re at home. We’ve just got to win one inning.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Friday showdown against EHM fits that same mold as those two games would yield Bristol a 6-5-3 ledger and a chance to get back into the postseason race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we can get those two wins there, we’re right back where we need to be,” said LaPenta. “And we’ll see where we’re at.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 19U staff</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the Bristol American Legion baseball squad is coached by Jerry LaPenta and assistant coach Rick Lemke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three other assistants from are former players for the program: Richard Lemke Jr, Adam Caron and Ryan Fradette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul LaFleur is the General Manager while Emily Thompson helps out in terms of electronic scoring and a whole bunch of other day-to-day functions.</p>
