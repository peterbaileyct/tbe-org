<p>Come Sunday morning, Lake Compounce will have opened for its 178th consecutive year and the Wildcat roller coast will be running, newly retracked and better than ever. And as it has been with the Lake over these many years, there will be new attractions, events and places to eat.</p>

<p>On a different note, the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether a president might be immune from prosecutive after having served as president. The case is Trump v. United States (23-939). Any Supreme Court deliberation is worth listening to, as are the cases worth reading. Knowing how these cases work, how they are adjudicated, are part of the American experience. I hope people are paying attention. If you have thoughts, we welcome letters to the editor and longer opinion pieces. Send them to editor@bristoledition.org.</p>

<p>Saturday turned out to be a beautiful day, and the hope is today will, too. Across the city, people were out and about. Over at Bristol Eastern High School, members of the Science National Honor Society held an electronics collection and car wash. Up the hill, at Page Park Pond, the annual Perry J. Spinelli Jr. Fishing Derby was underway. It was fun to see families huddled around the pond, with rods flashing and hooks and lines splashing at the surface.</p>

<p>Of course, Gaza is everywhere, especially with the student protests that are occurring across the country on college campuses. For a sober look at and somber analysis of the situation, there is the Ones and Tooze podcast, "Famine in Gaze."

<p>As for reading, I finished “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” by historian and public intellectual Yuval Noah Harari, and have to recommend the last chapters. They should be required reading because of how the author approaches the future and the possibilities that lay before us as sapiens.</p>

<p>Also, there are a few articles in The Atlantic that caught my eye. I am hoping they are available to the broader readership--The Atlantic, as with TBE limits the number of free articles before asking people for their financial support. Unlike The Atlantic, however, a membership with TBE is only $6 a month. Okay, commercial over.</p>

<p>The first piece is "Would LImitlessness Make Us Better?' by Rachel Khong. This topic takes on A.I. and how it offers limitless possibilities to human beings and whether or not human beings are made better by our imperfections.

<p>The second article, by George Packer is titled "The Campus-Left Occupation That Broke Higher Education." There is more to that title than simply right-left bickering. There is a history and analysis that transcends the political stridency, despite what the headline says.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
