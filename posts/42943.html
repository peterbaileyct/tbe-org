<p>Come Sunday morning, UConn men's and women's program will have played their first contests and come away looking good.  It's nice to see Bristol's Donovan Clingan making a contribution. Let's hope things keep going UConn's way.</p>

<p>The opening games of the NCAA tournaments are always fun. How about Oakland Golden Grizzles and their big upset, even though their run ended Saturday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will be looking forward to the men's game Sunday night.</p>

<p>Speaking of looking ahead, early this week, World War II veteran Joe Caminiti will be feted at yet another event on Tuesday at the American Legion Post 2 on Hooker Court. He will receive an honorary Marine Corp. jacket at a 1 p.m. ceremony. Caminiti is approaching his 100th birthday this fall.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, Caminiti and several of his fellow veterans gathered at the Bristol Public Library where they celebrated their friendships with a cake cutting. A toast and meet and greet will follow Tuesday's event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week starts with the podcast, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F**k," and its episode called "Productivity Expert Explains: How to Accomplish Far More While Working Less (featuring Cal Newport)."

<p>Another one along the same lines is from the Tim Ferris Show, entitled, "Seth Godin--Coaching Tim on Overcoming Resistance, Lessons from Isaac Asimov, Writing Secrets After 8,5000+ Daily Blog Posts." The title says it all, really. What caught my eye is Isaac Asimov and how Godin might be connected.

<p>And for reading, once again there is the book, "Sapiens." I returned to it because it has a lot to think about. Of course, I am reading others. One article that is more than interesting, is from the New Yorker, "The Forgotten History of Hitler’s Establishment Enablers: The Nazi leader didn’t seize power; he was given it," by Adam Gopnik. This is a book review with lots to say, not only about then, but also now.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
