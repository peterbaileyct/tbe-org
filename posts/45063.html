<p>It's Tuesday, May 7, 2024. Proceed at your own peril. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sunny and 81! Don't get used to it. Rain, cloudy and blah for the rest of the week.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The talk around the campfire</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The talk around the campfire is that behind the scenes the BOE has been hit with unnecessary expenses for the City of Bristol. Um, the GMB would like to buy a vowel and then maybe, if time provides before the commercial, solve the puzzle.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">End times are near</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A local doom and gloomer told the GMB that the end times are near due to among other things: unusual weather, War and one digital reader in Whole Foods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's just hope end times come with lower gas prices and a lower mill rate.</p>

<p>Dear YouTube content makers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stop saying you are filming or videotaping. The "camera" in your phone contains neither. Film is expensive and a little artsy for what you do and as for videotape, do they even make it anymore?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>the GMB staff</p>

<p>And now a word from our sponsors, Bristol. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
