<p>When Valerie Toner became Supervisor of Children's Services at the Bristol public library, she began to transform the children's department into a welcoming space for kids to thrive. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve often thought that this is not really a children’s library; it’s more of an intellectual playground. It’s a place that makes learning fun and helps kids start the school year with a head start in reading.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The department’s unique atmosphere features themed sections like the fairy tale forest and train station. There is also a Krayon Kiosk with tablets that feature educational apps like PBS Kids.</p>

<p>The children’s department staff welcomes families to spend the day in their department, and Toner feels that it’s a great place to beat the heat. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Come to the library and cool off. We have special programs and activities every day like stories and music. There are always crafts to do, books to read, and soft, comfortable seating.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The children’s department provides free lunch to kids and teens 18 years and under from 11:30 a.m. to1:30 p.m. The department has served around 800 lunches since June 27.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The children’s department has been breaking down the walls of the library by venturing out into the community. The staff regularly visit afterschool programs and hope to bring the library on the road more often.</p>

<p>The children’s department staff have designed activities to make learning fun, and Toner has seen a record number of children signing up for summer reading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m very excited about how well the kids are reading this summer. We have a little competition between schools to see who can read the most and it really motivates the kids. The principals of the schools get really into too’ it’s so much fun.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the library currently provides many activities and services for children, Toner said that she’s always looking for the department to grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s always more to do, and there are always more kids that we want to come to the library to have fun.”</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
