<p>Hello Trainers!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew with some brand-new Pokémon Go news for you!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The World of Wonders: Taken Over! event began Wednesday, March 27 at 12 a.m. and runs through Sunday, March 31, at 11:59 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Team Rocket has once again taken over another event, and it’s up to us to stop it. If you were not able to catch Groudon in the previous event, here is your chance to get the shadow version of this Pokémon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to have these types available to take it down: grass, ice, and water Pokémon will do the trick with ease. Make sure you complete the missions this week to get your chance to get it!  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shadow Mewtwo is coming this weekend! The legendary Pokémon has come back in its shadow form looking to escape the clutches of Team Rocket. This raid is special because you can only catch this Pokémon locally in a Team Rocket Raid. Mewtwo is weak to ghost, dark, and bug types. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My personal picks to beat Mewtwo this weekend would be Mega Gardevoir with the charged move Shadow Ball, Darkrai with the Charged move Dark Pulse, and Mega Tyranitar with the charged move Brutal Swing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure you have at least eight people minimum in your group to have a better chance of catching it. Here are the spawn locations for this event starting at 10:30 a.m. Saturday and ending Sunday at 5 p.m.: </p>

<p>This weekend is Easter, so happy Easter! Before I go, there is one more event happening next weekend. It’s Community Bagon Day! It starts April 8. Just like Litten Day, you can catch the dragon Pokémon Bagon -- and the shiny form too! More details about this on next time! </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
