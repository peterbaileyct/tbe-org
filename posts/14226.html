<p>TORRINGTON – The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team racked up a second consecutive Zone 1 victory on the road on Saturday afternoon, defeating Torrington by a 7-2 final from Fuessenrich Park in Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win improved Post 2 to 4-2 overall (3-2 Zone 1) while Torrington fell to 1-3 – losing two straight games after a .500 start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the triumph, Bristol sat in second place in the zone, just a game behind West Hartford – off to a perfect 3-0 start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But against Post 38, Bristol belted the home team for six first inning runs and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliott Norris (2-for-4, run) and Ryan Fradette (2-for-4, double, two RBI) led the charge with two hits apiece for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Churchill, Adam Caron, Ryan Maglio, Tyler Strickles, and Chris Osuch all generated hits that afternoon over Bristol’s nine-hit attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol batted .310 from the plate while getting walks from Roberto Cruz and Churchill as Post 2 has scored 18 runs over its past two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after allowing two first inning runs, Bristol pitcher Matt Beaucar did not allow any additional offense from Post 38.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar ended up going the distance, chucking a complete game, three-hitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throwing 106 total pitches, he allowed just three hits, gave up two earned runs and four walks while striking out six as Beaucar tallied his first victory of the season (1-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Dapippo drew the loss for Post 38, throwing over 100 pitches while giving up six runs in the first and a single tally in the fifth.</p>
