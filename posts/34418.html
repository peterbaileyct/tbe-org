<p>BRISTOL - Week 3 of the scholastic football campaign means that the squad from Bristol Eastern is heading on a road trip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a Connecticut High School Football Alliance game, the Lancers travel down to New Haven, squaring off against winless Hillhouse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undefeated Lancers have shown tremendous balance on both sides of the ball to date and if that same effort can be accomplished against the Academics, victory number three could be on the horizon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With no more gas money in hand for the month of September, here’s what to expect down in New Haven:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (2-0) at Hillhouse (0-1)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>6 p.m. (Bowen Football Field, New Haven)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series: </strong>Believe it or not, this contest is not the first meeting between the programs. This is actually the fourth time the teams have met up in non-conference play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Series Edge: </strong>The Academics lead the all-time series against the Lancers, 2-1. Eastern’s lone win came back on September 15, 1989. The defending Class MM champs knocked off Hillhouse 14-0 from Muzzy Field in Bristol. In that game, Eastern quarterback Steve Mills went 8-for-16 for 116 yards and a touchdown while J.C. Russell (21 rushes, 111 yards) caught a 12-yard TD reception. Jason Abbott scored the other touchdown via a six-yard plunge. The Lancers finished the season 8-2, just outside postseason qualification.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Last Season: </strong>The Academics went 3-7, as did the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week: </strong>Hillhouse had an early bye week while Eastern knocked off Hartford Public 27-13 from Alumni Field. The Academics lost to Foran on September 8 by a 37-12 final.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect: </strong>Hillhouse is a member of the SCC, playing in the third tier - like Eastern does in the CCC…The Academics haven’t put together a winning season since 2019 but the current group has a weapon on two on its side…First year QB Dairion Johnson can throw the ball but is a little lean on experience. He does like to throw the ball, making 30 attempts against Foran, but misfiring on 23 passes which led to two interceptions. Those seven passes when for 87 total yards and no touchdowns…Senior running back Elijah McClain (10 carries, 46 yards) has some tools on the ground as both of Hillhouse’s touchdowns against Foran came off rushing plays…And there’s some solid size on the line…However, if Hillhouse wants to test the Eastern secondary, the program has some answers…Adam Zavecz (two interceptions), Alex Corvo and Bryce Bacote are responsible for all the squad’s pickoffs to date and if Johnson wants to toss the ball around, there’s a hungry defense ready to respond in return…Eastern has tallied 13 total tackles for losses as Mikey Sherrill leads the team in that department with five…The Eastern defense allows a measly 1.4 yards-per-carry this season as the program has shut down the run games of both Farmington and Hartford Public…On third downs, opponents have gone 3-of-18 while missing out on four of five fourth down chances this season…Offensively, QB Kamden Laprise has connected on 50-percent of his passes while buddy Chase Dauphinee (eight receptions) leads the program in receiving yards by a huge margin…Hillhouse better be ready for the run game as Eastern averages a stout 6.0 yards-per-carry….Senior stud Jaiden Fore has nearly 300 yards to his name in 2023, good for a team-leading three touchdowns…Kicker Gavin Damboise is a perfect 8-for-8 on PATs and is dropping kickoffs and punts in all the right places…This contest is the home opener for Hillhouse…When was the last time the Kingstreeters went 3-0 to begin the campaign? It was 2010 when Eastern went 6-0 to start and 9-2 overall - falling to eventual state champion Masuk in the first round of state tournament play.</p>
