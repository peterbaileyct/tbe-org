<p>BRISTOL – This Saturday starts the second half of the campaign for the Bristol Central football program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over the years, the back-half of the season has been historically good for the Rams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, who will Central start that final pack of five games against?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why, against undefeated Maloney of course!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a rematch from the playoffs last season and the Spartans have not lost a step in 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be a huge challenge for the Rams, but you never know what’s going to happen from week-to-week in scholastic football.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is what’s on tap this Saturday as Central battles against one of Class L’s top programs:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Maloney (5-0) at Bristol Central (1-4) – CCC Tier I/II Challenge&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>Saturday,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>10 a.m. (Bristol Central turf field)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Maloney has been a longtime opponent of Central’s from CCIL and Colonial Conference days gone by. The Rams are just under .500 against the Spartans, snaring 26 wins and three ties while losing 30-plus games to the program. Typically, this series has gone back and forth over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>Both teams enjoyed the bye week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central's last win over Maloney:&nbsp;</strong>Back on October 12, 2018, the Rams hung a huge 29-22 loss on the Spartans in Bristol. Central’s Justus Fitzpatrick was too much for Maloney to handle as he ran the ball 31 times for 163 yards and two touchdowns. He threw the ball a perfect 6-for-6 that evening, collecting 57 passing yards and a TD. Some freshmen back by the name of Victor Rosa rushed the ball three times for six yards. Nate Rosa caught a 14-yard pass for a TD.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fast Facts:&nbsp;</strong>Man, Central seemingly can’t catch a break in terms of competition level…Maloney has an amazing program, scoring no less than 21 points in a game this year. But two weeks ago, winless Newington nearly gave the Spartans a real scare as Maloney hung on to win 28-23. That’s a close call…East Hartford, Hall, Simsbury and non-conference challenger Darien (don’t be fooled. Darien is still a heavy hitter) all fell to the Spartans and now, the program wants to win its sixth straight contest this season…This is a senior dominated team with a pretty good throwing quarterback. Senior QB Kyle Valentine has connected on 55-percent of his passes (39-of-71, 727 yards) for nine touchdowns…Three receivers have at least 127 yards to their name as senior Joziah Gonzalez (13 catches, 237 yards, four touchdowns) and junior Donte Kelly (nine catches, 181 yards, 3 TDs) leads the offensive onslaught in the air…And then throw in the ground game of senior Josh Boganski (84 carries, 308 yards, six TDS) and you have a pretty good 1-2 punch…Defensively, Maloney is solid – allowing 14 points or less in four of its five games…The Rams recharged its batteries over the bye week and after a tough two-game stretch, it’s back to work against a playoff bound Maloney outfit…Central was outscored 98-7 over its last two games against a suddenly resurgent Enfield squad and always tough Windsor program…The Warriors out-gained Central 307-93 but Tre Blair made some gains, making five carries for 43 yards. For the season, the speedster has compiled 33 rushes for 241 yards (7.3 yards-per-carry) and three touchdowns while quarterback Nik Salinas (2-for-10 passing, 28 yards against Windsor) has connected on 25 passes overall for nearly 400 yards and three TDs. He can run with the ball, carrying the ball a team-leading 56 times for 233 yards and three scores…Central, averaging exactly 140 yards on the ground this year, has some speed and if those athletes can get to the outside, anything is possible…Opponents have used the air to tally yardage against the Rams this season to a tune of over two yards-to-one and if Central’s defense can stop those pesky third down conversions, Maloney’s offense would be slowed a bit…Frankly, this is an epic challenge as the Meriden program is one of the best in the state…Don’t count the Rams out just yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
