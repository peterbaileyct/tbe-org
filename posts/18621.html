<p>The students and staff at Ellen P. Hubbell Elementary School are showing their support for the Bristol Police Department by making cards and food donations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re just trying to do what we can from our school,” said Kristine DeLeo. “The Police Officers are always great with us here at Hubbell; they’re always stopping by.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DeLeo, who is the Principal of Hubbell Elementary School, said the Hubbell Hounds began showing their support by making a banner last Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“It says ‘love and support from Hubbell School,’” said DeLeo. “The students signed it, and now it’s outside of the Police Station.”</p>

<p>The young Hubbell scholars continued to show their support this week by making cards. With some help from the Hubbell PTA, students cut out blue hearts and wrote personalized messages for the Police officers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Because we’re an Elementary school, we can’t get into the details of what happened,” said DeLeo. “The kids are so happy to be making the hearts, they’re so excited. They all wrote different things like ‘thank you for all you do’ and ‘we care about you.’”</p>

<p>The Hubbell teachers and staff continued to show their support Tuesday morning when they brought boxes of nonperishable foods and beverages to the police station.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wanted to send over nonperishable foods so that the officers could grab a snack or drink and just throw them in their cruiser when they need to go out,” said DeLeo. “We’re just showing support and love for our Police Department.”</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
