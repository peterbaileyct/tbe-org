<p>BRISTOL – In terms of CCC South competition, it was six meets up and six meets down for the Bristol Central boys track and field team this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the program did not rack up another 100-plus point effort, the Rams were still able to fend off a talented squad from Lewis Mills of Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central rolled to a perfect 6-0 behind an 82-68 victory over the Spartans from the track and field at BCHS – the final regular season home meet for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams could finish the season without a loss if the team can defeat crosstown rival Bristol Eastern next Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mills was pesky and kept the pressure on Central until the final event this past Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pulled off the win against Lewis Mills today to remain undefeated,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk via Twitter. “It was tight but so many boys stepped up to get the win.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central took two of the three relay events as the locals were winners in both the 4x100 and 4x400 challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100 relay, the combination of Cassias Breland, Noah Conrod, Logan Jackson, and Victor Rosa won the event in 45.66 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 4x400, Central’s team of Jackson, Can Tomak, Patrick Wininger, Frankie Porrini finished first in 3:45.7 for another win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa had an excellent showing in the 100 meters, finishing the race in 10.6 seconds, and in the 400 meters, Conrod won with a time of 52.7 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 1600 meters, Porrini was tremendous with a finish of 4:36 while Central did a quality job in the field as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Paulino took the triple jump with a leap of 37 feet and 11 inches while Treshawn Blair was the winner in the high jump with a successful make of six feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malachi Jones won the shot put with a toss of 46 feet, six inches and in the discus, Dan Lauretti won once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His throw of 130 feet, six inches was the winning mark as Central took the meet in the end to remain perfect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
