<p>Brian Grabowski and Drew Martineau both saw some time on the hill for Post 2 but were on pitch counts as Bristol hopes to have a long state tournament run and will need arms down the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the loss, Post 2 fell to 2-2 in 17U tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Bristol gets another shot at it tonight, again from Pat Kidney Field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The double elimination tournament has Post 2 squaring off against another Zone 3 foe, Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 4:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a four day stretch, Farmington rolled up 7-4 and 3-0 victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Jonathan Montgomery battled from start to finish over a tough losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed three runs on just six hits over an 87 pitch showing – walking only one batter.</p>
