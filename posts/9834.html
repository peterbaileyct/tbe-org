<p>Tuesday&nbsp;night marked only the second monthly meeting of the new Republican City Council, and in&nbsp;a stunning reversal, they voted&nbsp;5-2 to&nbsp;reject&nbsp;the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the City of Bristol and Wheeler Clinic, Inc. for&nbsp;Parcel 3&nbsp;at&nbsp;Centre Square.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the urging of Mayor Jeff Caggiano to vote in the affirmative,&nbsp;Jolene&nbsp;Lusitani&nbsp;,&nbsp;Jacqueline Olsen,&nbsp;Susan Tyler,&nbsp;Andrew Howe, and&nbsp;Cheryl&nbsp;Thibeault&nbsp;voted down the Wheeler project.&nbsp;Sebastian&nbsp;Panioto&nbsp;voted along with the mayor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposal was to relocate Wheeler’s Headquarters to the former mall site, now Bristol Centre Square. It would have brought 200 jobs to downtown inside a 30,000-square foot building. As a non-profit, the Wheeler project would not have generated any tax revenue, but it would have provided much-needed foot traffic to an area laid vacant for&nbsp;deacdes.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Councilwoman Cheryl&nbsp;Thibeault led the charge&nbsp;against&nbsp;the Wheeler contract. She&nbsp;defended her vote&nbsp;with&nbsp;a six-minute&nbsp;explanation&nbsp;stating,&nbsp;"I have a district that's by Bristol Eastern, and I also have the Green Hills neighborhood. And as many of you know, we're contiguous to&nbsp;Plainville and Southington, and&nbsp;resident after resident said,&nbsp;'Well,&nbsp;I spend my entertainment dollars in Southington&nbsp;and Plainville. I really want to spend them here.'"</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All five council-people that voted no echoed&nbsp;Thibeault’s argument but provided no new ideas on what entertainment project would take its place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Councilman&nbsp;Andre Howe said the project was dumped&nbsp;in their laps and felt the prime location was not a fit for a non-profit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Councilwoman&nbsp;Susan Tyler&nbsp;remarked, "I have talked to many business owners and residents in the downtown area. And just even this morning, I had two people who live in the downtown area and also conduct business in the downtown area. They said that when they walk around in the evening,&nbsp;that downtown right now&nbsp;feels creepy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to the vote, the Democratic town committee issued the following statement,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The Council has turned their back to a&nbsp;high&nbsp;quality&nbsp;non-profit already doing significant work in our community and schools which has already spent tens of thousands in design and site work. And, finally, it sends a strong message that Bristol does not follow through on its commitment on economic development promises and that it&nbsp;does not&nbsp;value the expertise of its staff or Economic &amp; Community Development Commission."</p>
