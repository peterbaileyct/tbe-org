<p>The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team went 1-1 this week, coming from behind to take out Berlin on Tuesday (43-40) while falling to Glastonbury (41-37) two days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the halfway mark of the season, the Lancers are 4-6 but have a slew of home games to end the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuesday saw the Lancers sweep the Redcoats this season but the three-point victory was a challenge because Eastern trailed for most of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed by six after one period (8-2), notching just two points over the first eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin led by nine (20-11) at the half and increased that edge to 29-18 after three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasnâ€™t looking good early in the fourth but the Lancers made a huge comeback in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern outscored Berlin 25-11 in the fourth period - good enough for a 43-40 comeback victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ciara Collins notched a team-high 20, Janessa Gonzalez added 11, and Taigan Parent flipped in eight to pace the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ayotte notched a career-high four points for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins dropped in half of her points over a tremendous effort in the fourth frame, including a basket on one of her patented spin moves in the lane late in the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in four consecutive foul shots down the stretch to help seal the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez added nine points to the till in the fourth, including a rare three-pointer from the baseline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Thursday, Eastern had a tough four-point set-back at Glastonbury, dropping a tough 41-37 decision on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins, who has led her team in scoring over the last 25 games, dropped in 29 points in the losing effort - including 13 over a big fourth quarter comeback bid. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a back-and-forth affair in the first half, but a late 3 from</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glastonbury's Madison Handrahan gave the home squad a 19-15 cushion at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the first six minutes of the third period, Glastonbury outscored Eastern 16-4 as the only Eastern points were our foul shots by Collins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Guardians nabbed a 35-19 lead before two baskets from Vanessa Drury towards the end of the third - the second one off a steal and drive for a layup - trimmed the deficit to 35-23 at the end of the three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the fourth, Collins dropped in 13 points - three hoops and 7-of-9 shots the free throw line - as Eastern got to within two points at 39-37 with 58 seconds to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Kiley Feeney's two foul shots with 5.4 seconds left gave the Guardians a four-point edge for the final margin of victory.</p>
