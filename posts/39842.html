<p>Before the day ended, Bakery on Maple had to close several times to shop for supplies, and even then, the day ended earlier than expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was incredible," co-owner David Landi said. "In my head, I thought, 'Ask for support, get a few extra people in for the day.' I never expected a line outside."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The customers started early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By mid-morning the display cases were empty except a few cupcakes and some loaves of freshly baked bread, and the line of customers would through the store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We went shopping for ingredients three times," Landi said around 2:45 p.m., "so we literally have nothing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Limping slightly from being on her feet since early in the morning, co-owner Erika Stirk, answered the locked door. She could not be happier with the turnout. She picked up where she left off, cleaning up and prepping for tomorrow, handing me off to Landi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outpouring of support wasn't just something that helped the bottom line, he said, it helped mentally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think it just makes the struggle worth it," Landi said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two have received cards from kids whose birthday cakes Stirk made, greetings from people who just stopped by to say hello and tell them that they are rooting for the bakery to succeed, to remind them that they have been customers for a long time, and they hoped to continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think as much as it's comforting to see the financial side, I think the emotional support is just as need," Landi said. "If you've gotten beat up over and over and over again, it's just nice to see people come in."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hand-written note on the door informed late arrivals that the bakery sold out and would be open in the morning at 9 a.m., and most of all, thanked everyone for their support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Landi reiterated that sentiment.</p>

<p>"There's nothing else to say," he said. "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was still astonished, he said. He didn't think it was going to be more than maybe 10 extra people on a regular Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When I walked out the first time," he said, "I had never seen so many people in here."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plan for the morning would be the same, except that there might be snow to contend with, he said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are going to be here no matter what," Landi said. "If it's still a little sloppy, we'll do DoorDash, so people don't have to trek through all the snow to get here. But that might be the only thing we do differently."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we were finishing up our conversation, there was knock at the door, and two customers, mother and daughter, were let in. They had with them a pizza from L.J.'s next door and some paper plates for Stirk and Landi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sandra Fabrizio, the mom, said that she loves the bakery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I want them to be here forever," Sandra Fabrizio said. She orders all her birthday cakes from the bakery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Anytime, holiday events, I work through them," she added. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gianna, her daughter, whose favorite treat is a chocolate croissant, said she loves the bakery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's things like this," Landi said, about the Fabrizios bringing in a pizza, that makes the difference. "It takes a village. It's nice to have our village."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, the bakery informed the public via its Facebook page that there was a good chance this would be its last weekend in business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Saturday, Landi said prospects looked better, and that Stirk and he who had already begun conversations with their credit union about refinancing, would continue those conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, a GoFundMe page started by a customer had raised almost $3,000 of its $10,000 goal by 4 p.m. Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
