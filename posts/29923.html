<p>The organizers of the 2023 Rockwell Summer Festival encourage people to "Come hungry" to this year's event, this Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with its 13 food vendors and a giant food tent to enjoy eating in the shade.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that's not all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There's the field section with another 68 booths plus 21 KidZone booths," said Jesse Jablon, West End Association vice president at the last meeting of volunteers before setup starts at 7 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group met Thursday evening at Indian Rock Nature Center for a final information session for the volunteers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the 11th festival in the past 13 years, having missed two summers during the Coronavirus pandemic. A record 180 vendors in total, far above the 155 from last year, will be on hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We really take pride on presenting this for the benefit of everyone in Bristol," Jablon said in an earlier email exchange.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the activities will be the Bristol Auto Club car show, 12 bands performing on two stages, a pie eating contest mid-afternoon, a KidZone with mini-golf, corn hole and a Home Depot builders workshop. The Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services will have painting with kids, and Cub Scout troops will offer its GAGA Pit, inflatable archery and obstacle course. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Build a birdhouse at the Home Depot builders workshop and at the next BPRYCS booth next to it paint the birdhouse, Jablon said, at the meeting Thursday night, before some of the small army of volunteers who help direct vendors to their spaces and return to guide them out at the end of the day.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
