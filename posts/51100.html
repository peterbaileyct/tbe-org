<p>"We're still waiting on some final invoices to come in," said Patti Philippon in an email, "but we expect to have raised close to $14,000, which will help support the museum's educational programs and collections."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are very appreciative of all the sponsors, guests, and donors to the event for helping make this such a fun and successful evening."</p>

<p>Catering was by Main Street Pint &amp; Plate. Wines were chosen by Maple End Package Store. Guests took part in a silent auction and scavenger hunt bingo game. There was also a wine &amp; snack pairing/tasting. Wines were donated by Northeast Winemaking in Plainville, with a Rose/shortbread cookie pairing, a Zinfandel/ ark chocolate pairing and an Albarino/pretzel pairing.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
