<p>Come Sunday morning, more than once I will have heard during the week that our weather is more like Florida's than Connecticut's. The soupy humidity and downpours appear to be more the routine than the exception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, we have had a few nice days, and a fairly good one for the Fourth of July, which included some grilling and a walk along the beach. While there were fireworks, Mary and I skipped on home where the booms and crackling in the neighborhood persisted through most of the evening--which is to be expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, things were pretty calm--knock on wood--for the holiday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent Supreme Court decisions, however--a bunch of them released at the last minute--provided plenty to think about, so that, when it came to listening and reading, I was drawn to a few podcasts and, ultimately, to the cases themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is easier than ever to obtain copies of the court's opinions. I have included a link to the website below. While they are legal opinions, the writing is clear and clean, and I would say accessible, if one is willing to take the time to read one or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am always surprised at how clear the opinions are, if at times a bit dry. At the same time, I find that as compelling as a majority opinion might be it is always good to read the dissenting opinions as well as concurring ones because, for me, this is one way to get a fuller "picture."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As will all persuasive writing--and legal briefs are persuasive as well as argumentative essays-- it is important to see where the author is coming from, what angle they are taking, what is included as well as what is omitted. Reading the dissents fills in some of this information.</p>

<p>So, for reading, how about attending to one of the Supreme Court's latest rulings. Any one of them would do, but here is a link to Trump v. United States (23-939). The attached pdf begins with the syllabus or a discussion of how the case was decided and a summary of the decision. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The syllabus is followed the majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, a concurring opinion by Justice Thomas, a concurring in part opinion by Justice Barrett, a dissenting opinion by Justice Sotomayor joined by Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson and a dissenting opinion by Justice Jackson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In total, it's 119 pages long. To get the full import of the opinion, it makes sense to read, at the least, the majority opinion and the dissents. Click <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>I can't say it enough, it doesn’t take much imagination to see that local newspapers of any quality are few and far between. Here at TBE, working under our nonprofit Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project, we aim to make Bristol a community with a vibrant and engaged local community newspaper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can help. Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>We are seeking reporters to cover sports and city meetings, neighborhood news, people and entertainment–book reviewers and movie/tv streaming reviewers–take note. Contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;to for next steps.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
