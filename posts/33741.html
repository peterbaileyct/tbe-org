<p>Forty-eight minutes into Saturday night's inaugural show, featuring the Queen tribute band Celebrating Queen at the newly renovated Rockwell Theater, the lights went out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The band was thumping their way through a high-energy rendition of the high-energy "Tie Your Mother Down," with the audience singing along when the sound and lights blinked off and did not come back on, a consequence of a lighting strike.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fans were not deprived, though, because the signature moment of the night occurred during the power outage. Lead singer Joe Archambault, without missing a beat quickly changed gears. </p>

<p>Accompanied by Shane McDonald on piano, Archambeault entertained the audience by providing an impromptu performance of several songs. The highlight was the audience sing-along of Queen's most note worth composition, "Bohemian Rhapsody," which featured the introduction, operatic passage, the hard rock section, and the ballad-like coda.</p>

<p>"Joe was fantastic," said Tom Burns, who drove from Westbrook for the evening show. "The people around me were all smiling and happy and excited and singing themselves."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I knew the power of Joe's voice and his acoustic abilities so when the power went out, I was hoping he would sing without the mic, and he did beautifully," he said. "'Bohemian Rhapsody' was off the charts."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the sing-along, Archambault told the audience that the emergency power, which was a few lights, would only last another 15 minutes and everyone had to leave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The power went out at 8:50 p.m. The cause was reportedly lightning hitting a transmission line, knocking out power to 14,000 Bristol homes.</p>
