<p>To the editor:</p>

<p>I have noticed in Good Morning, Bristol! a few swipes have been given to Biden and none given to Trump. This seems to be a common practice with the news. Today’s media needs a better memory and a lot of education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These times we are living in are brutal. Brutal in the sense that the heat index keeps rising and it’s extremely hot out there. Brutal in the sense that things cost so much. Brutal in the sense that women rights are being taken away. Brutal in the sense that outright lying and spinning the truth is acceptable to some. Brutal in the sense that the Supreme Court is taking away our sacred laws and security. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brutal in the sense that guns are more protected than people and mass shootings are more common now than ever. Brutal in the sense that the media is obsessed with Joe Biden getting out of office and elder abuse is ok. Brutal in the sense that the media isn’t asking Donald Trump to get out of office because he’s asking us to give up our freedoms and become a communist nation, plus he’s a felon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brutal in the sense that almost nothing makes sense these days. Why is this happening? Is it because we’ve sat back and forgot to care about subliminal things? Things we don’t see but need to have in order to live in a peaceful society? Things our family members sacrificed and fought for so that life would be better for us? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When are we going to take our rose-colored glasses off and look at what’s really happening to us? America is us – you and me. Stop thinking you don’t matter. Stop thinking because it’s said in the media it must be right. Stop thinking you don’t have the time to do anything about any kind of changes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stop thinking you don’t have time to get involved. Stop thinking you don’t have the time to learn the truth. You are so important to the future. Look, we’re only human. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our current President is only human too. History will show that what he has accomplished in his four years is outstanding. He cares what happens to this country. Things are not perfect. Take the time to learn why they’re not perfect. Stop trusting those with an agenda. </p>

<p>A little caring brings big results.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
