<p>BURLINGTON - It’s never an easy match when battling against the Lewis Mills boys soccer program in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Spartans were sharp against the squad from Bristol Eastern on Friday, even as the locals attempted to make a match out of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills took control early and went on to defeat the Lancers by a 4-1 final in a late afternoon contest from the Nassahegan Field at the recreational complex in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans (2-0) continued their undefeated streak while the Kingstreeters (1-1) lost for the first time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills grabbed the lead nearly right off the bat and never relented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Begert knocked home a Mills’ corner kick just three minutes into</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>the match, making it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But going into the second twenty of the first half, it was still just a one-goal match before Burlington added two scores in a matter of 2:21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 10:59 remaining in the first period, Aleksander Swider scored on a breakaway for the second goal of the game and just over two minutes later - with 8:38 to play before the break - he scored again after working a quick 1-2 pass with Rob Rubbo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at intermission, Burlington’s squad led 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Mills' quick feet and sharp passing dominated us in the first half," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. ”We adjusted in the second half and were much better connecting passes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trimmed the deficit back to two midway through the second stanza with a little slick scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 28:03 to play, Eastern’s Eddie Ansah collected a Lucas Tylicki cross into an area that Mills failed to clear - scoring Eastern's lone goal to make it 3-1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minutes later, the Lancers just missed out on a second score as Rocco Barbino got free on the left, but Mills' goalie Merek Nardi just got a hand on Barbino's shot to stop it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rubbo closed out the scoring with 16:52 remaining on an unassisted goal to make it 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marek made four saves for the home team while the Eastern’s Peyton Cummings nabbed a season-high eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben Foley and Sebby Wroblewski kicked in assists for the undefeated program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back home on Monday (3:45 p.m.) in a CCC confrontation against Wethersfield while playing a make-up game at Plainville on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 3:45 p.m. from Tinty Stadium in Plainville.</p>
