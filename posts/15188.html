<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Main Street Community Foundation, through its&nbsp;spring&nbsp;competitive grant cycle,&nbsp;announced that it has awarded&nbsp;grants totaling&nbsp;$163,535&nbsp;to49&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;serving&nbsp;Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth,&nbsp;Southington&nbsp;and Wolcott. This round of grants will help these organizations meet the needs of&nbsp;local&nbsp;residents.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Foundation strives to bolster a variety of causes in the communities it serves,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the arts, historic preservation, and&nbsp;youth&nbsp;athletics.&nbsp;It also assesses and supports&nbsp;other pressing needs in&nbsp;the&nbsp;communities, such as&nbsp;food insecurity, lack of resources for homeless&nbsp;and low income individuals, or people in domestic violence situations.&nbsp;The&nbsp;annual spring general grant cycle&nbsp;supports all of these causes&nbsp;with distribution from&nbsp;over 30&nbsp;endowed&nbsp;funds&nbsp;that&nbsp;were established by donors to support what they are most passionate about.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grant applications for this cycle are submitted once a year, and&nbsp;they are thoughtfully reviewed by 24 local residents that make up the Community Foundation’s volunteer Distribution Committee. The Committee&nbsp;not only&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;all proposals,but also&nbsp;conducts&nbsp;site visits, and makes&nbsp;the final funding recommendations to the&nbsp;Foundation’s&nbsp;Board of Directors. All of this is to ensure&nbsp;that&nbsp;the grants awarded are feasible and align with the donor’s intent. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
