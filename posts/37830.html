<p>The 5th Annual Community Conversation, focusing on ending the stigma of mental illness and featuring the comedic touring group, "1 Degree of Separation," will be held on Saturday, Jan. 20, 2024, at 6 p.m. at The Rockwell Theater at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attendance is free but program sponsor Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services recommends reserving a seat at <a href="http://BristolRec.com">BristolRec.com</a>, since seating is limited.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The "1 Degree of Separation" website states, explicitly, that the show, with a subtitle of "A Funny Look at Suicide and Depression," is aimed at ending the stigma of mental illness through comedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Depression has one degree of separation: if you don't suffer, then someone you know does," the website states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following that statement is the group's aim "to bring dialogue, awareness, and acceptance for those suffering from depression through laughter and vulnerability."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement continues with, "We laugh at the dark stuff, because laughter releases the pain. We talk about depression, because no one should feel shame."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It concludes with this, "With an army of comedians, we hope to kill the stigma of depression and share stories of hope, happiness and triumph.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
