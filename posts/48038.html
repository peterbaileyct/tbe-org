<p><strong>Walter Kenyon</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walter, a 1948 graduate of Bristol High, recently passed away. He played three sports, football as a captain, basketball and baseball. He went into the U.S. Navy during WWII and after returning home he carved out a successful career with General Motors (New Departure).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While here, he was a founding member of those who brought Midget Football to Bristol, a move to bolster the sport. These fellows were well-known men in town.</p>

<p><strong>The Name Game</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The storm Beryl is pronounced barrel. It reminded me of Beryl Josephson, the mother of 1980’s Olympic Synchronized Swimming champions Karen and Sarah. Her first name is pronounced as “Brr-el.” I had her as a teacher when she was Miss Pease: She married Carl with a “C,’ not with a “K.” We’ve had a few Karls here in town as well as Beryls.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On one particular page of Bob Adamczyk’s “Streetscape” booklet, the history of the names of roadways in Bristol, one page has streets with the word Wood (or wood) in it 14 times. Well, we were all woods territory-wise at one time decades ago.</p>

<p>Dan David was our IT guy at the old Bristol Press. Reversed, his name would be David Dan, and I know there are some of them named so in this country.</p>

<p><strong>Robertson Airport</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the pandemic, folks were home-bound more than ever. With this, I suggested that parents take their kids to Robertson Airport, park their car and watch for planes coming and going from the runway. It’s still something interesting and cost-free to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson, no relation to Mrs. Robinson of the song named as such, was a Plainville icon. I met him at the Bristol Public Library some years ago when he was in his 90’s. He was quite the interesting fellow.</p>

<p><strong>Hartford Circus Fire 80 years</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 6, 1940, 80 years ago, 168 people died in Hartford’s Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus Fire. These were folks from within Connecticut and outside. One lucky girl, who lived right up the street from the location was supposed to go with a friend and her mother. For some reason, she stayed home, she told a local newspaper. Those youngsters who survived would be in the age range of 83-84 or so today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m searching to see if there were Bristol victims, but do not believe there were any. One who died was a Plainville girl, Miss Ann Berube of 23 Church St. in that town, and is buried at St. Joseph Cemetery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fire was considered to be one of the most devastating in this country at the time. It still is today.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
