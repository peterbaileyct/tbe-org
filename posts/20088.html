<p>WEST POINT, N.Y. - It was a tough Saturday afternoon for the UConn football program when the team squared off against a struggling Army contingent on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies just couldn’t generate enough offense as penalties and missed opportunities marred a career day by freshman Victor Rosa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, the UConn football program finished the regular season campaign at 6-6 as the result of its 34-17 setback at Army from Michie Stadium in West Point, New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies are still bowl eligible and with all the games available that will need a team, an invitation to play one final pigskin contest is still on the table for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Black Knights improved to 4-6 overall but had few answers in slowing down the former Bristol Central standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa spun Army for a collegiate season high of 111 yards on only 12 carries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His team-high 43-yard rush saw UConn hit early pay dirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on his only TD of the contest, Rosa’s 43-yard dash capped a seven play, 80-yard gambit that gave his squad a 10-7 edge with 3:12 left to go in the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lead changed hands a couple more times after that before Army’s Braheam Murphy scored on a sizzling 75-yard run to post the home team to a 20-17 edge with 8:20 showing on the clock in the third period - never trailing again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa averaged over 9.0 yards-per-carry against Army, helping the Huskies zip up 254 total yards in offense from the ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But bad luck and misfortune haunted UConn until the final horn as big plays were wiped out due to penalties and the like as the program from Storrs fell to .500 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn's 6-6 ledger is the squad’s best finish since 2015 - a year the program also went to a bowl game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, the Huskies finished the season at 6-7 overall while earning a trip to the St. Petersburg Bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Rosa has scooped in 561 rushing yards on 124 attempts to date. He’s scored nine touchdowns and averages 4.5 yards-per-carry. Rosa has also caught five passes for 15 yards while making a combined 23 kickoff and punt returns for 312 total yards on special teams. Overall, Rosa has tallied 873 yards in offense over a brilliant first year at the collegiate level.</p>
