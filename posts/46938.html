<p>A Bristol Pride celebration brought together one of its largest gatherings in the past three years to Good Shepherd Episcopal Church this past Saturday for an evening of food, music and games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group of over 50, among them adults and children, families and friends, gathered inside the church hall for grilled hot dogs and sausages, homemade cake and an assortment of cookies and cold soda. Others played ping pong and board games and chatted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside, on the front lawn, others enjoyed freshly made smores and listened to music provided by musicians around a fire pit. Children tossed frisbees and played baseball. Volleyball was also available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The music was led by Father Link Hullar, pastor of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, which opens its doors to Bristol Pride, the event organizer, for meetings and events. Hullar with his guitar and sheet music sat with other musicians around the fire pit, where people listened or sang along.</p>

<p>The festive occasion, however, did draw some unwanted attention, with at least one passerby shouting a homophobic slur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past few months, the Pride flag that typically hangs by the church's front door has been damaged, torn down and left tattered at least three times.</p>

<p>Bristol Pride has for its mission "to highlight both the diversity and commonalities of humanity through facilitating an annual Bristol Pride event and related events throughout the year to serve Bristolâ€™s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ+) community members and encourage LGBTQ+ individuals, groups, and allies," as stated on its website.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
