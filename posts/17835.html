<h2>Greater Bristol Realty Corp. nears completion of three new homes</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friday last, the Greater Bristol Realty Corp. (GBRC) and partner Neighborhood Housing Greater New Britain held a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the near completion of three new affordable homes at their project site of Evergreen St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among those at the celebration were state officials Connecticut Commissioner of Housing Seile Mosquera-Bruno, Connecticut Housing Finance Agency Chief Executive Officer Nandini Nataragan and U.S. Housing and Urban Development representative Alanna Kabel. The project was made possible by programs run by these agencies and other contributors from the bank and foundations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Representing the local community was Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The homes are being purchased by three local residents and first-time homeowners, according to a press release from the GBRC. GBRC has operated in Bristol since 1996 when it was established as a non-profit community development corporation by the Bristol Housing Authority. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original purpose of the corporation was to own and operate a community center to serve the needs of Housing Authority tenants, but later that year its mission was redefined to promote first-time homeownership opportunities for low- to moderate-income Bristol residents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2005 it became financially independent from the Bristol Housing Authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most recently, in 2016 GBRC partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build three houses on Bernie Avenue and a single house on Margerie Street. For its next project in Bristol's West End, GBRC will again partner with NHS of New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To qualify, families must not have owned a house in the recent past and cannot have a combined family income of more than the state's Dept. of Housing's definition of "moderate income." At the same time, a family must earn enough to qualify for a mortgage. NHS of New Britain is responsible for identifying qualified families.</p>

<p>About 100 state and local leaders, board members, donors, employees, and friends gathered on Thursday, Sept. 29 at a groundbreaking ceremony for Wheeler’s planned 46,000-square foot community health center and administrative headquarters at One Hope Street in downtown Bristol, according to a press release from Wheeler Clinic. The site is an approximate 1.3-acre lot between North Main and Hope streets.</p>

<p>The press release continues: The site will combine many of Wheeler’s administrative departments with a consolidation of its two existing community health centers at 10 and 225 North Main Street. About 200 full- and part-time employees will work at the new building, which will become the organization’s flagship location. Scheduled to open in late 2023, the site is Wheeler’s first newly constructed facility since its original location in 1972.</p>
