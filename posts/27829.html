<p>While Mother Nature knocked out the Senior American Legion Baseball game against Northeast on Sunday afternoon, another casualty of the weather came at the expense of the junior team from the city as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Zone 3 juggernaut was scheduled to play against Farmington (4-4) from Tunxis Meade Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as Muzzy Field got drenched, so did the facility in Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Puddles started to form along the first base line and other spots around the infield, forcing a postponement at Tunxis Meade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 came into the weekend at 8-1 overall, winners of two straight games, looking to get back to the top of the Zone 3 standings.</p>

<p><strong>Light week sees Torrington leapfrog over Bristol</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past eight days, Bristol has played just twice - going 2-0 - while getting a ton of practice along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that stretch, Torrington flipped into first place after falling to Bristol on June 17 by a 2-0 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington has won four straight contests, moving to 9-1 overall and carries a half-game lead over the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 38 defeated Ellington on the road (7-4) before winning three straight at home to move to 9-1 on the campaign and a perfect 6-0 in Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is a perfect 5-0 at Riley Field in Bristol this year and 3-1 on the road with just the 9-8 loss to Tri-County in eight innings last week over an unfortunate restart of a suspended game due to darkness.</p>

<p><strong>The tops in Zone 3</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Torrington and Bristol in the standings, Zone 3 is a bit bunched up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In third place is Waterford at 8-2 overall (for the record, Waterford is about 50 minutes away from the Forestville section of Bristol. It’s really crazy that Bristol - or any one of the former Zone 1 teams - has to make a trip that far at the Junior level).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, at the top of the standings in Zone 3 is Ellington (7-2) and South Windsor (6-3) in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>The 2023 Bristol Roster</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rosters for all the American Legion baseball teams in the state are set and that includes the 17U program from the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s program has representatives from several local high schools, including Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern, St. Paul Catholic, Wolcott and Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all that talent has produced a great team for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
