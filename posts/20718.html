<p>BRISTOL - Was there any doubt that Bristol Central softball standout Kaley Laird was going to be competing in the sport at the next level?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The infielder is a tremendous athlete with more than a little pop at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when collegiate programs showed interest in her talents, Laird was able to make a great instate choice - close to home to boot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why when Laird was able to sign her National Letter of Intent to play softball for the program at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic on November 9 - in front of family, teachers and friends - it was a big deal for the Bristol Central community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If anyone here has ever had the opportunity to be anywhere within one-hundred feet of Kaley, you know that’s she’s filled with energy and spunk and that certainly translates to success on the field,” said Central principal Pete Wininger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Laird signed on the dotted line from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium, a facility she played in over the years as a member of the ever-improving girls basketball team, her collegiate future was set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Eastern Connecticut is definitely getting a passionate player,” said Central softball coach Monica Hayes of Laird. “She enjoys improving and learning about the game. I’ve said it before, her IQ is second to none.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The softball program at Central was a sterling 22-5 last season and leading off the batting order for that talented crew was Laird - a 2021 CCC South All Conference pick (and should have been selected in 2022 as well) because Central doesn’t get as far as it did without her in the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird has been one of Central’s top softball players since she took the infield at BCHS and while she’s seen gains on the hardwood (and was hanging out on the bench with the Class L State championship volleyball team as its number one cheerleader), everyone knows the sport she truly enjoys and excels at.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She has an unbridled love for softball,” said Hayes to Laird. “There’s always a smile on her face no matter what the score is and to be able to continue doing that and get to play softball for another four years, it’s got to be a fantastic feeling. Not everyone gets to be in her shoes. I hope you understand that and appreciate this opportunity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’ve created this for yourself.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her athletic ability seems boundless as Laird can be slotted anywhere around the infield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She can easily move from second base to play over at shortstop and that versatility will help her immensely at ECSU.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird hustles 24/7 whether she’s running out an infield hit or chasing down a ball for a big putout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sometimes, she’s running after balls that aren’t even in fair territory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve watched her outdoors for a long time now and my experience coaching through Little League, coaching through high school, watching collegiate level games, etc, she’s still the only active player who goes out on the field every inning who loves to chase foul balls,” said Wininger of Laird. “You’re the only person I’ve ever seen do that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the collegiate level, Laird is going to excel because she’s an athlete who simply loves to play the game of softball and will be a model teammate on the Warriors’ roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Division III program is going to a player tailor made for the collegiate game as her leadership and intelligence should keep her towards the top of the batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, the Little East Conference will allow Laird to show off her skills against competitive programs that will raise her level of play on a semi-local level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s only going to continue to improve as she plays,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hayes also used the adjectives like “resilience” and “competitiveness” to describe Laird which “will be beneficial for her at the next level.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That includes the work she’ll put in the classroom which should churn out an amazing career opportunity by the completion of her time at Eastern Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s a leader at Bristol Central and will be at ECSU when she gets there in the late summer of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re more than a softball player,” said Hayes to Laird. “Moving forward for the rest of your life, going to Eastern Connecticut, one of the best things about you is that you embrace your community. Everybody in the school knows who Kaley Laird is, especially teachers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And soon, a certain campus in Willimantic will know what Laird is all about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until then, you’ll see plenty more energy, a little dancing on the field as she’s warming up and expect a tremendous senior campaign that could result in something very big if all the pieces fall into place like they almost did last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I do enjoy watching her on the field and in the dugout because she’s non-stop,” said Wininger. “The biggest part of that is you all know that she’s a fighter. She’s been through from some trails and this is really just a tribute to her effort and her fearlessness to be in the position she’s in right now.”</p>
