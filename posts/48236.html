<li>· Southington Community Services - $1,500</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>· Town of Wolcott - $900</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fundraiser took place at the Foundation's annual Women of Wonder this past May. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the event, which celebrates the Women &amp; Girls Fund and the grants made throughout the years, small purses were placed on each table and passed from one attendee to the next for donations to support a specific cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year’s cause, inspired by the needs identified by local organizations that serve women and girls, was personal care items for senior women in the towns and cities the foundation serves -- Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington and Wolcott.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roughly one in three older adults aged 65+ are economically insecure, and senior women are more likely to live in poverty than men, according to the release announcing the grants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dollars cannot be used for personal care items and therefore many women simply go without because these products can be expensive. The top requests by senior women in the local communities are disposable washcloths, denture adhesive, incontinence products, shampoo and body wash and deodorant.</p>

<p>Main Street Community Foundation has awarded a total of $780,000 in grants from the Women &amp; Girls Fund to organizations and individuals in Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington and Wolcott since the Fund’s establishment in 2001.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
