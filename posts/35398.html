<p>Then the whirring of the Life Star helicopter blades growing stronger as it looped around Forestville before landing at Bristol Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residents gathered in solemn vigils to pay their respects to the fallen officers. Flags flew at half-mast, businesses displayed blue ribbons to show their support for the Bristol Police Department.&nbsp;Residents throughout the city replaced their porch light with blue light bulbs to honor their memories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community members placed flowers, candles, crosses, notes and ribbons in front of the Police Department. The memorial grew to become a national destination for those who wanted to pay their respects to two men who were tragically taken from their families, friends and the community too soon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The memorial stood through rain, wind and snow from Oct. 13, 2022 to Jan. 23, 2023 before it was moved indoors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has been a year since a senseless act of violence claimed the lives of Lt. Demonte and Sgt. Hamzy, two men who were much more than law enforcement officers to our community. They were mentors to our children and friends to those who needed a friend.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city of Bristol will forever remember and honor the heroic actions of these officers. Their dedication, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to the Bristol Community remembered every day.</p>
