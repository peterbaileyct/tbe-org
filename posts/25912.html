<p>MIDDLETOWN – The Bristol Eastern girls track and field team absolutely thrashed the squad from Middletown last Tuesday afternoon – seizing a 120-30 victory in a CCC South bout from Middletown High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers saw multiple athletes earn dual wins as the visiting aggression was too much for the home standing Blue Dragons to handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern dominated in the field and on the track, eventually winning all three relay events. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speedster&nbsp;Princess Priscilla Dilone won both the 100 (13.1 seconds) and 200 meters (27.1 seconds) for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s&nbsp;Julia Armington took the 400 meters in 1:03.4 while teammate Cecelia Gilbert was the winner of the 800 meters (2:32.13).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Rogers nabbed the victory in the 300 hurdles with a finish of 56.2 seconds while Bristol Eastern girls basketball sixth man, Amanda Noel, showed the leaping ability that helped her block numerous shots this past season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She won the 100 hurdles in 18.4 seconds and her leap of 29 feet, seven inches was the mark to beat in the triple jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Braccia was a dual winner as well, taking the high jump with a make of four feet, 10 inches and in the long jump, her leap of 14 feet, four inches ended up being the winning mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayvenn Duquette chucked the javelin 70 feet, four-and-a-half inches for the victory in that event while Kimberly Guzman won the discus with a toss of 70 feet, 11 inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jamayrie McRae Arroyo’s toss of 25 feet, six inches in the shot put event was good enough for the win while long distance running sensation&nbsp;Kaelyn Gonzalez ruled in both the one and two mile challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She won the 1600 meters in 5:39 while her finish of 12:21.3 in the 3200 meters was an amazing way for her to end her day in the individual events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there were sweeps over all three relay events.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Armington, Jaryanet McRae, Braccia, and Princess Priscilla Dilone&nbsp;won the 4x100 in 53.1 seconds while the unit of Armington, Kaydence Meyer, Emily Piendak, and Priscilla Dilone&nbsp;took first place in the 4x400 (5:01).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the combination of Gilbert, Gonzalez, the crafty Lauren Ayotte, and Emily Piendak&nbsp;took first place with a time of 11:00.9 to help Eastern go 3-for-3 in the relay races&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the Kingsteeters are back in action on Tuesday in a quick trip to Berlin in a CCC South meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event commences from&nbsp;Biscoglio Track at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
