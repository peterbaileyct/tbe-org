<p>The Board of Finance voted to approve the costs for Northeast Middle School and a new firehouse for Forestville at its meeting earlier this week on Tuesday in the city council chambers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the board engaged in a detailed discussion with Bristol Fire Chief Rick Hart over proposed staffing increases that will bring the city into compliance with national standards, both for fire departments and insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"While the building committee saw a marked increase from estimate to cost," said Board of Education chair Dante Tagariello in response to the unanimous vote, "I think the committee is comprised of a strong bench of individuals who have previously served on school building committees and who are looking out for our best interests by way of value engineering to ensure the project doesn't balloon or go beyond its intended scope."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he knows the Board of Education appreciates the support of the Finance Board and the city on the project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Northeast Middle school is a cornerstone piece to ensuring we can reimagine the district and return to a consistent model--K-5, 6-8, 9-12--that our students, parents and staff were looking for," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The overall $102,375,000 cost for the new school is $13,306,035 more than the original conceptual estimate of $89,068,965. The schematic design work was completed by Dâ€™Amato+Downes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Areas where the increases were largest were in trade costs, which involve labor and materials for plumbing, electrical and HVAC of over $8 million and construction costs, which include building construction, labor and materials of over $10 million.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A resolution to add the $13,306,035 to the previously allotted $89,068,965 for the total cost for the school seeks board approval to issue bonds, notes or obligation for financing. The proposal for the Northeast Middle School to replace the current school is for a 130,000 sq. ft. building at the same location. The final decision is subject to approval by Joint Board.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new firehouse for Forestville, Firehouse 3, has gone through several iterations before being considered in its current form. Originally, the city appropriated almost $7 million dollars for a 10,281 sq. ft. station with three bays that was subsequently reduced to 7,700 sq. ft. with two bays after costs increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fire Chief Hart said the final plan was a compromise, but he feels good about being able to move forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The final plan" Hart said, "will serve the community of Forestville and Bristol, hopefully, for the next 100 years."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This approved plan returns the third bay for a total of 8,734 sq. ft. for a cost of $8,770,000, requiring an additional $1,720,000. The funding comes from bonding and was added to the previously approved amount. The increase is subject to final approval by the Joint Board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hart also presented, in detail, a proposal tied to the acquisition of a new ladder truck, along with the Firehouse 3 project, that would increase staffing of the Bristol Fire Dept. by 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I totally understand the trepidation that they are feeling," he said, on Friday, in reference to concerns raised by the Finance Board on Tuesday. "It's kind of like sticker shock for the Finance Board. But I want to impress upon them the liability because we are not compliant."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coincidently, he said he had just gotten off a Zoom call about new OSHA updates, which now incorporate many National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's more onerous for municipalities across the state," he said, especially in light of the governor's reluctance to fund, at the state level, local police and fire improvements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"So we have to do what's right for the safety and security of the citizens of Bristol," Hart said, when it comes to compliance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The proposal for 16 new staff, Hart said, would be funded for the first three years by a Federal Safer grant, that covers salaries, exclusive of benefits. The fourth year the city would be responsible for all costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"With the building that is going on in town, our call volume is going up, I have notified the powers that be that we are not complaint," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"God forbid if something happens, the first question a lawyer is going to ask is, 'You were told of this issue, why didn't you address it?' And that is what I am afraid of."</p>
