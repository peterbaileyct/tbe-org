<p>BRISTOL – The series city baseball battle between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern couldn’t have come at a better time as each of the public-school programs will be looking to get to the midway point of the season with a fourth victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This has the makings of one heck of a showdown as both the Rams and Lancers have been playing a bit better despite the sub-.500 records each squad carries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest takes place from Muzzy Field on Monday with a start time of 6:30 p.m. - weather permitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (3-7), after getting blown out against Northwest Catholic 14-2 back on Friday, April 22, had a real chance to run the table to the Central game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that first showdown against the Lions, the Lancers went 1-3 but only lost those three games by a combined seven runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is right there as one bad inning against both Lewis Mills (7-5) and Platt (8-5) foiled the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern spun Maloney by a 5-2 push this past Wednesday, proving Eastern is more than capable in winning the big game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days later, the Lancers were trailing 5-0 in a rematch against Northwest but trimmed the deficit to 5-3 and was one fair ball away from taking the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a credit to the Eastern program who will be looking for its biggest victory of the season against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the hill, it could be Jayden Churchill that the Rams must tangle with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill helped that Eastern turnaround with a little veteran leadership as well as his pitching prowess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s one of the best leaders that I’ve had in any sport,” said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet of Churchill. “He brought the team in the other day, had a little get together, team meeting in the locker room. He just does things that right way.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Maloney, Churchill racked up 11 strikeouts, smacked out two hits, and scored two runs over the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not just a one-man show over at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio is responsible for the Lancers’ other two wins this season and makes things happen on the hill and at the top the batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rio Fernandez has a stick and is an ever-improving catcher while Elliot Norris also makes up part of the solid first four in the batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D’Amato (it’s still strange to see a D’Amato not playing in the infield at Eastern) is the complete package.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s showing tremendous ability in left field and has been one of the program’s leading hitters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game is about poise, staying consistent, and ability - something D’Amato displays every game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He is a baseball player and it is just a pleasure to watch him swing the bat and do the things correctly,” said Gaudet of D’Amato. “He’s what Bristol Eastern baseball is all about.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after that meeting with Churchill in the locker room, even Gaudet added a little input.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet isn’t a big talker in things like that but all that extra focus has produced positive results.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season is a marathon, not a sprint, and Gaudet likes the troops he’s running with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That grouping also includes Owens Myers, Mike Roalf, Cyr, Conor McCormick, Ian Latko, and Caleb Molinsky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These guys are just a pleasure to coach,” said Gaudet. “They compete, they give me everything that I can ask. We’re going to scrap and we’re going to keep fighting until the end.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s exactly what Gaudet and Bristol Eastern plans to do against Bristol Central come Monday night.</p>
