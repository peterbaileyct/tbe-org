<p>An afternoon filled with groovy music will rock Bristol in a benefit concert for Brian’s Angels this weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “Psychedelic Sunday” fundraiser will feature five of the state’s best rock bands, with 100 percent of the proceeds going to Brian’s Angels. The concert kicks off at 12 p.m. at Bleachers Bar on Middle Street with acts performing until 6 p.m. Tickets are $20, and can be purchased online or at the door.</p>

<p>“These guys have been amazing, helping us out,” said Pat Stebbins. "They all volunteered their time. We’re busier than ever right now and this will really help us out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stebbins, who established Brain’s Angels in 2015, has seen large uptick in clients since the eviction moratoriums ended in 2021.&nbsp;The number of people in need of their services is climbing at an alarming rate, she said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A couple years ago, we were feeding 20-25 people a day,” said Stebbins. “Now we’ve had days with close to 60 clients,” said Stebbins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Right now, one of my old volunteers is a client,” continued Stebbins. “They’re 60 years old and living in a tent.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stebbins founded Brian’s Angels&nbsp;in memory of her son Brian Pinz, who died after having a period of homelessness. The nonprofit organization has grown continuously over the past seven years, and they hope to put some of the proceeds from the benefit towards a bigger space.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the volunteers who worked to make the “Farm Fest” benefit concert for Brian’s Angels a success earlier in the year are returning for Psychedelic Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m just glad to be able to help out,” said Michael Cansdale. “Pat is a staple in this community; she helps out so many people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cansdale, who has planned five Brian’s Angels events, is a lifelong resident of Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lineup features the Rob Glassman Band, LB4, The Neybas, Someone You Can X-Ray, and Jeff Summa and the Roasters. Following the final set, members from each of the five bands will take the stage for an epic jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t say enough about the people involved in this,” continued Cansdale. “All these great musicians are volunteers; Scott from Bleachers donated their space, and let’s not forget the volunteers from Brian’s Angels will be working at the event.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian’s Angels are seeking baskets to be raffled off, which can be donated before or during the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
