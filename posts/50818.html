<p>Bristol Eastern (1-1-1) and Enfield (2-0-1) battled to a 2-2 tie Tuesday afternoon.  It took a late goal by Enfield's Brayden Eckert to knot the score.</p>

<p>Eastern would tie the game, with 13:45 remaining in the half, when Lucas Tylicki took a Drew Viens pass, moved quickly over midfield, and found Leslie Adzo cutting to the goal. Tylicki threaded a pass to Adzo who sent a hard shot past Enfiled keeper Jayson Wachtel.</p>

<p>Eastern had two good chances to break the tie, but both shots went wide of the Enfield goal.</p>

<p> "We started slowly but gradually were able to slow down the sharp passing of Enfield," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.  "We would have loved a win, but getting a result on the road did show improvement from our last game."</p>

<p>Eastern's goalie Connor Murtaugh had two sharp saves in the first half and ended with six for the afternoon.  Enfield's Wachtel also made six saves.</p>

<p>The Lancers are home on Friday evening for a 6 p.m. game.</p>
