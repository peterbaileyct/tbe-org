<p>Patrons of the Bristol Farmers Market now have the opportunity to stretch their food budgets further, thanks to a new initiative that doubles SNAP benefits at participating vendors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Farmers Market, Inc., recently awarded nonprofit status, received a grant from End Hunger Connecticut to implement the program, which allows Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to double their benefits when purchasing locally grown fresh produce.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We helped a lot of people today, and that’s really what we want to do," Cheryl Thibeault, treasurer of the Bristol Farmers Market, Inc. she said. "Now that we’re a nonprofit, we were able to apply for a grant. Anyone with a gray SNAP card can shop here and their benefits can be doubled and used for healthy fresh food."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under this program, SNAP beneficiaries can receive double the value of their benefits, effectively allowing them to purchase twice the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables. The market plans to continue doubling SNAP benefits until the grant funds are exhausted.</p>

<p>The Bristol Farmers Market is participating in the End Hunger Connecticut Fresh Match program, which provides incentives for purchasing fruits and vegetables. In addition to Fresh Match program, SNAP benefits can also be doubled for meats, cheese, organic snacks and bread through the True Match program, which expands the options for participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local vendors at the Bristol Farmers Market participating in the program include Gresczyk Farms, Tonn’s Marketplace, and Twin Pines Farm for fruits and vegetables. Green Acres Farm provide options for grass-fed beef, Better Baking By Beth offers fresh bread Amazing Love Farm provides organic snacks. In addition to fruits and vegetables, Twin Pines Farm also provides cheese.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There’s no grocery store in this neighborhood," said Thibeault, "so it’s great that people can leave here with fresh fruits and veggies.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants can take advantage of the doubled benefits by visiting the market’s SNAP/EBT table, where they can exchange their EBT cards for market tokens that can be used at participating vendor stands. The Bristol Farmers Market is an authorized SNAP/EBT farmers market, ensuring access to SNAP-eligible foods throughout its operating season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The market operates weekly on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 10 Main St., continuing through Nov. 2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
