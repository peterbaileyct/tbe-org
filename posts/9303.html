<p>BRISTOL - The auditorium at Bristol Central high school was abuzz with excitement on Wednesday as a certain 7-foot-1 center from the boys basketball team made his collegiate decision official.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On National Signing Day on Wednesday, Donovan Clingan put his name on the dotted line, committing to the University of Connecticut and will play for the men’s basketball program next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was one of the most anticipating signings ever in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you told me freshman year that I’d be here today, I’d look at you like you’re crazy,” said Clingan. “After a lot of hard work and determination, I am here [to sign with UCONN].”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He thanked his father for pushing him to be the best player and person he could be, along with his grandmother and coaches at Central and beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he knows his mother is looking down on him as well, extremely proud of the young man he’s become and the choices he’s made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan thanked the entire school community at Bristol Central from the students, teachers, and staff along with UCONN coach Dan Hurley for the chance to become a member of the Huskies’ program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’d liked to thank Coach Hurley and the rest of the UCONN staff and family for believing in me and giving me such a great opportunity to play at a great school,” said Clingan.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is not the end, it’s just the beginning and I have to keep working.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been an amazing ride for Clingan, the entire Central boys basketball program and long time coach Tim Barrette over the last three scholastic seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Wednesday was just another special day to celebrate all those remarkable achievements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The way you have handled these accolades, the pressures and the spotlight amaze me every single day,” said Barrette. “Donovan, you’ve never put your personal success in front of your team’s, remained humble throughout the entire process and kept working hard both before and after your decision was made to attend the University of Connecticut.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank you for letting me be part of this ride.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette said UCONN is going to get a good player but even a better person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there were plenty of people who wanted to let Clingan know how special the decision was to the city of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“On behalf of the Bristol board of Education, I’d like to congratulate Donovan on signing his letter of intent to the University of Connecticut. You should feel great about the decision you’ve made today and extremely proud of yourself. It was your hard work and your dedication in the classroom and on the basketball court that has brought us here today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Athletic Director Chris Cassin finished his speech with two simple words: “Go Huskies.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Carson Rivoira has been playing basketball with Clingan since they were both in kindergarten and seen everything that’s made the big man a model teammate and an outstanding - and fun - person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Since I’ve known him, he’s not only been a great basketball player but someone everyone wants to be around,” said Rivoira. “He’s always smiling, laughing and in a great mood. And although he may seem big, you’ll not find anyone else that is more like a kid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The administrative team at Central, including principal Pete Wininger, assistant principal Ryan Broderick and Geoff Sinatro, was personally thanked by Barrette for all the support the trio has given Clingan over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No other student in the school has a relationship that Donovan shares with” Wininger, Broderick, and Sinatro said Barrette. “From fishing trips to morning workouts, I thank you all for what you have done for this young man.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger, a former coach of the boys basketball program at Central, has seen some of the best athletes compete for the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s known Clingan for years from games at the Boys and Girls Club travel program in town and Donovan was always known as, “the big kid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while that big kid has made the BCHS boys hoop program one of the best in the state, the young man isn’t just all about basketball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Even now as a young adult, he’s still a big kid,” said Wininger. “He enjoys a lot of things outside of basketball and I think it’s important to make note of the fact he is probably one of the happiest people I’ve ever been around. I don’t see Donovan have a bad day and if something goes wrong on the court, you’ll see it in his eyes, you’ll see it in his mannerisms but he’ll turn it into something else.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a unique individual. He has the heart of a lion and the heart of a teddy bear at the same time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that teddy bear will also dunk on any player not wearing the maroon colors of Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette called Clingan a pillar of the school and that wasn’t just due to his 7-foot-1 frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when it could have been easy to leave Central, knowing other prep schools and programs were itching to grab him, he stuck it out in Bristol all four years - which was very admirable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t thank you enough for the trust you have in this team, our school and our coaching staff,” said Barrette. “I’m going to miss the goofy looks I get when I ask you a question in AP Environmental class and you have no idea how to answer."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette called Clingan a hero to his son (‘dunking like Donovan’), bringing a smile to his coach’s face when he sees the two interact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m so proud of this young man with the decision he’s about to make, the same pride I felt when I hugged you after we captured the CCC tournament last year versus East Catholic,” said Barrette. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that win, Donovan said, “one more to go coach.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before hitting the court at Gampel Pavilion, Clingan and crew will be looking for the ultimate prize this season at Bristol Central - a state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rivoira knows that all the hard work Clingan puts in every day should lead the Rams to that title game come the month of March.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s always in the gym working on his game and he works extremely hard in practice to make himself a better player and his team a more complete team,” said Rivoira. “We’re very lucky to have Donovan here at Bristol Central and we’re looking forward to a memorable senior season with him leading the way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“UCONN is very lucky getting such a great player and an even better person.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that fact about getting a chance to suit up for the Huskies isn’t lost on Clingan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m excited to play in front of the best fans in college basketball,” said Clingan. “I can’t wait to see what the next four years have [in store for me].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank you and go Huskies.”</p>
