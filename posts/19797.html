<p>The men’s basketball program at the University of Connecticut is 2-0 to open the 2022-23 season and former Bristol Central All-Stater Donovan Clingan is a big reason for that fast start for the program in Storrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies defeated both Stonehill College and Boston University to date as the locals are looking for big things when Big East play rolls around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan has done well in a reserve role, already in the mix as a freshman, coming off the pine to make an impact on both sides of the ball as the 7-foot-2 center is still an imposing sight on the hardwood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Clingan averages 9.5 points and 7.0 rebounds-per-game in less than 16 minutes-per-game this season at UConn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a tremendous start for the likeable Clingan and his demeaner and coachability has been off the charts at the collegiate level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, nothing has changed after leaving Bristol Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also continues to block numerous shots as he’s rejected six over that two-pack of contests – averaging 3.0 blocks-per-game to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies booted Stonehill last Monday by an 85-54 final from the XL Center in Hartford and then this past Friday, Clingan made his debut at Gampel Pavilion as UConn downed Boston University 86-57.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his first ever collegiate game, the center from Bristol posted nine points, seven rebounds and four blocks against Stonehill – towering over every player on the court like he did for years at Central – while Clingan wasn’t far off a double-double in the Huskies’ victory over Boston University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan zipped up 10 points, seven rebounds and rejected two shots in just 12 minutes of action against the Terriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has scored 19 total points and tallied 14 rebounds which would prorate out to 22.1 points and 16.3 rebounds-per-game over an average stint of 36 minutes played.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those numbers look extremely familiar to the totals Clingan posted when playing at Bristol Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is currently first for the Huskies in blocked shots, second in rebounding and fourth in scoring despite just getting those 15.5 minutes an outing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From a shooting front, the freshman standout has connected on 7-for-11 shots from the field (63.6-percent) and canned 5-of-8 attempts from the free throw line (62.5-percent).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has yet to attempt a three-pointer (stay tuned).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next week, the undefeated Huskies play three times – all from within the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Tuesday, UConn battles the University of Buffalo at the XL (7 p.m.) while on Friday, UNC-Wilmington travels to Gampel (8:30 p.m.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then it's back to Hartford on Sunday at 5 p.m. as the Huskies host Delaware State University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That stretch of games gives UConn and Clingan a real chance for the program to go 5-0 before its first road test of the season against the University of Oregon (Thursday, November 24).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>More on Clingan&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to his bio from the UConn website, Clingan is one of three true scholarship freshmen on the 2022-23 roster and figures to earn plenty of floor time – already making an immediate impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan was a consensus Top 50 recruit that scored a school record 2,268 points which ranks him seventh all-time in Connecticut state history under Bristol Central head coach Tim Barrette.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, Central went 28-0 and won the CIAC Division II state championship with a twenty-point victory over Northwest Catholic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan’s final numbers as a senior: 30.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 6.2 blocks-per-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, Clingan also had a tremendous season despite the pandemic wiping out several games along with the CIAC title tournaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He posted 27.3 points, 17.2 rebounds and 5.8 blocks-per-game as the Central program was a perfect 15-0, taking home the CCC Championship in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan led Central to a school record 42 straight wins, a streak that will continue into the 2022-23 scholastic campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is a two-time Gatorade and Max Preps Connecticut State Player of the Year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget, the center maintained a 3.5 GPA at Central as one of the most remarkable student-athletes to ever come out of the Mum City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
