<p>WEST HARTFORD - The Northwest Catholic girls soccer team had to run through the gauntlet before and during its Central Connecticut Conference showdown against Bristol Eastern on Friday evening in West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers etched up an early lead against the Lions but the home team persevered in the end, scoring four straight goals in nabbing a huge 4-1 victory to stave off the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the win, Northwest (6-7-2 overall) earned a trip to the state tournament while the Kingstreeters fell to 5-7-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a gritty win for NWC as several substitutes were forced to start for the Lions, performing well and doing a tremendous job in earning the victory against an Eastern program on the prowl.</p>

<p>“The story of the day was Northwest Catholic's ability to handle adversity, finding out just a couple hours before game time they would be without multiple starters and having to wear masks during the game, as they were deemed close contacts,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “However, despite trailing 1-0 midway through the first half and without several key cogs, they persevered&nbsp;and never gave in, earning a 4-1 rout of the Lancers.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Emily Nelson started off the scoring spree 24 minutes into play, assisted by Ciara Collins, to put the Lancers ahead on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Collins won a punt from Northwest and headed it straight through to Nelson who did the rest, beating the keeper for the 1-0 lead,” said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But from that point on, it was all NWC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions Alexsia Lily scored off a rebound with eight minutes to play in the first period and that stalemate lasted into the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then midway through the second frame, the Lions scored back-to-back goals in a matter of three minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Leblanc notched a goal and then assisted on Emily Nicholas’s tally as the home outfit wrangled up a 3-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring, Eastern put the ball into its own net by accident with four minutes to play as the 4-1 push was too much for the Lancers to overcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of keepers, Eastern’s Grace D'Amato notched 10 saves while counterpart Brianna Lebrun had one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern finishes up the regular season with a date against crosstown rival Bristol Central on Tuesday at 4:45 p.m. from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
