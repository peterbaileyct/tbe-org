<p><strong>Dreams</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dreams are funny things, hard to explain. I sometimes think there are things in our lives that are deep-seated and they pop out in part when sleeping. I had one Monday that included Burr Carlson, Dave Mills and Bob Beaulieu about that night’s basketball practice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob wasn’t able to make it, and this was an odd thing due to the fact that Bob wasn’t on the team. He was a football and track stud. This was in 1962 when the Lancers captured a state title with the likes of Terry Burke, Dave Della Bitta, Bill Gtreger, Larry Penoncello and Gary Palladino leading the charge,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did Bob Beaulieu get in there? Maybe because I was thinking about Bob’s wife, Diane (Spiek). Diane was our female class athlete at Eastern in 1963. A few years after school here, Diane had aspirations of running in the Olympics. Her uncle Adam was a standout multi-sports athlete during the years encompassing the 1940s.</p>

<p><strong>Olympia Diner</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of the Olympics, remember the Olympia Diner across the street from McDonald’s on Rt. 6, and that it was moved to Newington some decades ago? Well, that famous landmark is up for sale. I recall going there years ago to reminisce.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember the ABC rental store nearby in Bristol? The partners also owned Harry’s Place in Colchester at the time. There was a recent local TV news show that had followers select the state’s best hamburgers and Harry’s came in No. 1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John Reardon, Sr. and Jim Tetro</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of the most popular faculty managers in Bristol schools John Reardon and Jim Tetro. Both were mild-mannered, smart and conscientious. Mr. Reardon was quiet, while Jim was more out-going. Two Bristol legends!&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Donovan Clingan</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donovan, who will play for Portland in the NBA this season I predict will average:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>12.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 2.0 blocks per game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Double identities</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The late manager of the Bristol American Legion Baseball team Dr. James F. Gilhuly was known as two different men by some folks. He was a chiropractor doctor here and baseball manager outside of town. Very well-liked by players here and elsewhere, he would bring sandwiches for his players at away games.</p>

<p>Hello to Bernie and his lovely wife, Jean Sue. I enjoyed working with both at the Bristol Historical Society and with Bernie on other matters and organizations.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
