<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Near the center of Bristol’s West Cemetery in the hilly terrain of Section 4 is a Civil War obelisk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dedicated in January of 1866, it is one of Connecticut's oldest Civil War monuments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The base measures six feet six inches, while the column stoically stands 25 feet tall, capped by an eagle with its wings spread out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firty-four inscriptions were carefully etched into the brownstone bearing the names of the Bristol men who answered the call for service to their country, and never returned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But hidden within the shadows of the monument amongst Civil War veterans is an unmarked grave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tomb’s remains are that of a runaway slave from Virginia who aided a legendary Union regiment following his escape near the end of the Civil War and came to live in Bristol for 30 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remarkedly, due to his wide circle of friends, numerous acquaintances, ready wit, and sense of humor, the once-fugitive slave became one of Bristol's most popular and favorite residents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, he does not appear in any books about Bristol; there are only a few documents in his name, and his tale has not been told in over a century.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His name is Henry Boswell, and this is his story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The End</strong> (How I Got Here)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the first months of the pandemic, I became aware of Henry Boswell (also known as Henry Bosville and Henry Bosworth) by reading the Hartford Courant archives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A one-thousand-word story, originally published on July 5, 1904, provided some details of his life in slavery, escape to a Massachusetts regiment, and life in the following years. When the story was published, Boswell was around 70 and suffering from rheumatism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that as the backdrop, I stood in West Cemetery on a hot, late afternoon near the end of July 2020, searching for his final resting place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a cemetery map in my hand, I had a good view of where he was interned among some of Bristol’s Civil War veterans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the cemetery's <s>quiet and</s> ankle-high grass, I slowly walked between the aging tombstones, confidently <s>and naively</s> thinking, “This will take five minutes, ten tops.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could not have been more wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>July turned to August, August gave way to September, and September became winter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, I lost count of how often I searched the grounds. It was in the early morning, afternoon, and evening. It was in the heat, rain, and winter’s cold. Friends, family, and strangers were enlisted to help, but there was no Boswell marker in Section 4 or anywhere else in the nearly two-century-old cemetery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I researched his life, 2020 turned to 2021, and before I knew it, the calendar flipped to 2022, then 2023, 2024 and now here we are in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During this time, one thing nagged at me. No, actually, two: 1) Why was this story forgotten? and 2) <em>Why am I doing this?</em> Those answers would come with time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Searching the Bristol Library card catalog for his name in the town newspapers shows no references to Boswell or a runaway slave. And when I asked local historians about him, I got a lot of confused looks, like what dogs do when they hear an unfamiliar sound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike some Bristol stories that are told and retold, Boswell’s had utterly disappeared with his death, which bothered me. During my research, I had become a protector and felt duty-bound to tell his story. However, I needed to expand on those 1,000 words from 1904.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At its core, we had an extraordinary story, but it was reported 40 years after it happened, and there was no additional reporting in over 100 years. But if I could flesh it out by amplifying the details while finding documents, new sources, and bits of information, a local hero could be acknowledged once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, the piece would just read top to bottom and merely report what was previously reported.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A historian in Virginia warned me early on, though, “Due to the custom of the times, there would be little reference to an enslaved person.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, at one point when information was hard to locate, a friend advised, “Ya know, maybe it didn’t happen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was determined to prove them both wrong, but how? I knew little about that period, and Boswell had no family that I knew of. Thus, the deep dive began.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I stood in West Cemetery on that hot summer evening, I had no idea that over the next four years, I would send hundreds of emails, explore the use of ground-penetrating radar to find his grave, visit numerous libraries, and drive nine hours and over 500 miles from my home in Bristol to Southside, Va., to find Henry Boswell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Henry Boswell and Life in Virginia</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":52566,"width":"868px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Lun-002-PPT-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-52566" style="width:868px;height:auto"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henry Boswell never knew his birth date or age. He believed he was born into slavery on the same Virginia plantation as his parents.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As best as can be determined, he was most likely born in 1835, when Andrew Jackson was president.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was the legal property of David Pulley, a farmer in Meherrin, Va., located in Lunenburg County, an area known as Southside Virginia and part of the lower Piedmont, which lies between the James River and North Carolina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meherrin is 10 miles south of Burkeville, a small town in Nottoway County but a prominent railroad junction for The Danville and Richmond Railroad and the South Side Railroad during the Civil War.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With its rolling and gentle foothills, Lunenburg was rich with pine forests and groves of oak, peach and cherry trees. The land was mostly farmed for tobacco but was rich in wheat, oats and corn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also hip-deep in slavery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 1860 census shows that of the 882 households in Lunenburg, 516 (58.5 percent) owned slaves, more than twice the average Virginian county. Meanwhile, the average slaveholder in Lunenberg possessed nine slaves, and that free labor produced more than 50 percent of Virginia's tobacco.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not much is known about Boswell as an enslaved person only that he spent his time working the fields with the other slaves, and when they were not working, they gathered in their cabins and entertained themselves by singing songs, telling stories and amusing themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henry Boswell could not read or write because, by law, slaves were prohibited, and once freed, he said he never took the time to “learn his letters.” Consequently, there are no documents in his hand. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Documents during the antebellum period naming Boswell by name do not exist either, but there are slave schedules from 1850 and 1860, as well as an 1840 census that imply his time as an enslaved person on Pulleys’ farm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slave schedules were population schedules used in the 1850 and 1860 censuses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slaves were not named but were accounted for by age, color and sex under the slave owners' names. They were maintained to tax owners’ “property” rather than enumerate them in the population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The slave schedules for Pulley in 1850 and 1860 and the 1840 census, if followed through, are consistent with a black man born near 1835, residing on Pulley’s farm until 1860, the last census Boswell was in Virginia. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":40084,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1860-Pulley-Slzve-Schedule-735x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-40084"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">1860 slave schedule, David Pulley (bottom right)</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Boswell’s account, Pulley did not mistreat his slaves. In fact, he said it did not appear to be a hardship. His only objection was that he was not paid for his labor, and he had good reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Owen Allen outlines in "Tobacco, Slaves, and Secession: Southside Virginia on the Brink of the Great Rebellion<em>" </em>that the price for tobacco and monetary gains in Lunenburg doubled between the 1840s and the 1850s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consequently, Henry Boswell said he learned there was more to life than enriching a slave owner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David Pulley</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David Pulley was born in 1807 and died in 1871. He married Sara Frances Dance around 1845, and they were the parents of three sons and two daughters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An 1864 Confederate Army map shows the Pulley farm in the northwestern part of Lunenburg County, near the Prince Edward County line along a stretch of roadway then known as Shelton Road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":40085,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/EH-STokes-to-Puley-Map-1024x456.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40085"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">1864 Confederate Map, Pulley Farm upper left</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Boswell, Pulley owned as many as 25-30 enslaved people.&nbsp; However, the slave schedules show Pulley had 9-13 on the books.&nbsp;They do not take into account any short-term slave labor he may have hired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lunenburg County records show that between 1837 and 1841, Pulley made three land purchases, one of which was 180 acres.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Presumably, he farmed tobacco because it was the foremost cash crop in the county.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Pulley and the Confederates</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite being exempt from serving in the Confederate Army due to a health issue, he did work for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Receipts located from July and November 1864 show Pulley was paid for loading wagons at the train depot in Meherrin. At the time, Pulley had seven male slaves ranging in age from 12-64, and Boswell, more likely than not, was among them.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Confederacy also paid his wife Sarah for 15 pounds of potatoes and 500 pounds of beef in December 1862.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While those documents provide a brief glimpse into his business dealings, others are more telling of the times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One is a letter to President Andrew Johnson seeking a pardon for following the war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the letter, Pulley became a mail courier in 1853, covering from Moore’s Ordinary (Meherrin) to Yatsville, one X miles away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the war, Pulley, like many who did ordinary tasks for the Confederates, sought a pardon. <s>During the war (following the war in 1866, he was contracted by the postmaster general to resume his route). Following the war, it was confederates to request pardons, which included</s></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next was a letter written shortly after the Civil War when Black Union Troops were overseeing the area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pulley and 29 of his neighbors requested Virginia Gov. Francis P. Pierpont remove the black troops because they feared retribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The letter stated in part, “The presence of these troops amongst us is very repugnant and humiliating to our feelings and we fear will result in improper and injurious influence on our former Slaves now inclined to be disorderly insolent and Vitious and we earnestly ask you to use your influance to have them removed or if necessary, their place supplied by white troops.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The circumstances upon which Pulley put his name to that letter are unknown. Note, ADD THE NEARBY COUNTY AND THE STATS OF BLACK VS WHITE SERVICEMEN AT THE TIME</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Escape</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Orchestrating an escape from slavery took planning, incredible bravery, and fear. The fear of being caught and the prospect of punishment must have been terrifying. The desire for freedom, though, outweighed any fear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The article in 1904 was short on details about his escape; it merely nibbled at the edges, so I wanted to learn more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Boswell’s account, in the fall of 1864, while working in the fields, he could see the Union Army encamped within a few miles of Pulley’s plantation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a now-or-never moment, he said his goodbyes to the other slaves and slipped away to the Union camp and the Massachusetts 57th, where he offered his services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Boswell’s telling, he was well received by the 57th and was with them at the Siege of Petersburg. He was made an orderly and assigned to the unit’s chaplain, Captain Shields, from Stockbridge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With nowhere to go after the war, the chaplain invited him to Stockbridge to live with his family. Following Stockbridge Boswell moved to New York and then Connecticut—first New Haven, later Plainville, and then Bristol around 1884.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few inconsistencies here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number 1:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Massachusetts 57th&nbsp;Regiment was raised late in the war from Western Massachusetts. It was a Veteran Volunteer Unit with new recruits. Of the initial enrollment of 1,052 men, two hundred and forty-five soldiers were reenlistments. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The regiment would rank third of all federal regiments in the war, with a kill-loss rate of 19.1%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In April 1864, they mustered in Worcester and arrived in Maryland between April 18 and 20. The regiment was attached to the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By May 3, they entered the Campaign from the Rapidan (which flows 88 miles to north-central Virginia) to the James River.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 16, the 57th&nbsp;joined the Siege of Petersburg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Petersburg is 60 miles from Meherrin and Henry Boswell, I needed to determine how Boswell connected with the unit from western Mass. when they were so far away in the fall of 1864.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Number 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examining the rolls of the Massachusetts 57th, there was no Captain Shields. It took working with the National Archives to determine that Captain Shields was Reverend Alfred H. Dashiell Jr.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was the regiment's chaplain and was held in high regard by its men. In addition to the spiritual guidance he provided the troops, he tended to the wounded, corresponded home on behalf of some soldiers, and buried the regiment's dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His duties did not come without danger. Eleven Union chaplains were killed in battle, including Rev. Arthur B. Fuller of the Massachusetts 16th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alfred H. Dashiell Jr. was born in Maryland, and at the time the war broke out between the states, he was a pastor with the Presbyterian Church of Stockbridge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The War of the Rebellion divided families, and the reverends were no exception. In a letter dated June 2, 1865, from a field hospital in Virginia to Major Gen., O.O. (Oliver Otis) Howard, Captain Dashiell outlined the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His father, the Rev. Alfred H. Dashiell, was in Tennessee and came north because of his “conscientious views on Slavery.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His sisters, despite living in Tennessee, “maintained their loyalty.” However, his twin brother George was a captain in the Confederate Army and on the staff of Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Forest was one of a few men who enlisted as a private and became a General. He was a polarizing figure—a legend in the South and a war criminal in the North.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In May of 1865, following Lee’s surrender, Alfred Dashiell was ordered to Burkeville to work at the Confederate Hospital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hartford Courant story from 1904 is short on specifics, but Boswell could have escaped while Dashiell was in Burkeville. However, because his escape to the 57th&nbsp;was in the fall of 1864, I needed to explore all avenues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One possibility was that his escape occurred during the Wilson-Kautz Union raid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Wilson-Kautz Raid</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":40307,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wilson-Kautz-Raid-03-red.png" alt="" class="wp-image-40307"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wilson-Kautz raid occurred over 10 days beginning in June of 1864. It was designed to cut off Lee’s supply lines. One was The South Side Railroad, an east-west line connecting Petersburg to points west, which meant Boswell’s home in Lunenburg County.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After two days of planning, the raiding party left Petersburg in the early morning of the 22<sup>nd</sup> with 5,500 troopers and 16 cannons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the 23<sup>rd,</sup> they arrived at Burkeville around 3 p.m. and dismantled the tracks while receiving light resistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day, they were in Meherrin at the train depot, only two and a half miles from Pulley’s farm. They laid waste to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sgt. Roger Hannaford, 2d Ohio Calvary, a native of England, described it vividly in his journal: “About five o’clock we reached Meherrin’s Station…on the Danville Railroad. Here in both directions could be seen the desolating effects of war. The Depot was burnt to the ground, the water tank was still standing but its supporting posts were slowly consuming. The road bed was wrapt in smoke as far as the eye could reach…and the few inhabitants visible were dejected and despairing, and although now cringing, their dislike toward us could [not] be entirely hid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the depot and the adjacent outbuildings, three homes close to the tracks caught fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, they bivouacked overnight close to the rail lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his account, Boswell said the Union “marched to within a few miles of Master Pulley’s plantation and encamped within sight of some of the truest rebels that ever breathed.” Unfortunately, there is no elaboration in his account. Was the Meherrin Station the area described by Boswell?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It lines up. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With several thousand troops, cannons, carts, and horses, the raiding party was spread out over the terrain as he described. Boswell certainly saw the smoke and the Union troops while hearing the commotion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the AM, the raiding party moved southwest, followed by a growing number of runaways seeking federal lines and freedom. The best estimates say the number swelled to 1,200.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some came willingly; others were seized. Referred to as contraband because of X, they included families, mothers with babies, and men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Reams Station, though, the Union was trapped and exhausted, so they burned their wagons and escaped in a free-for-all. As a result, the slaves were abandoned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the estimated 1,200 slaves that were moving with the raiders, it is believed that 400 made it to Union lines. The rest were captured or killed. Some federal reports state that some Confederates ceased their pursuit of the Union and instead put their efforts into shooting down fleeing slaves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wilson-Kautz was an exercise in futility. While many of their objectives were met, they endured over 1,400 casualties (), were taken prisoner, and the Rebels repaired the tracks within weeks, including Burkeville, where train traffic returned by July 9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beginning in August, following the raid, E. H. Stokes, who lived three miles from Pulley, placed runaway slave ads in at least three Virginia newspapers offering $4,000 for the nine slaves who escaped from his farm during the raid. The ads appeared at least six times.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no evidence presently showing Pulley placed a similar ad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boswell seemed unlikely to flee during the raid because the Massachusetts 57th was in Petersburg. If Boswell escaped during the raid, it was miraculous that he survived. Although I did not rule it out, I felt it was not probable based on the available evidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After reviewing both stories, it appears more likely that Boswell escaped when Dashiell was at the army hospital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I reached out to the ancestors of the Rev. Dashiell's family, and they were unfamiliar with this story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was then that I started considering a visit to Virginia, but the issue of his burial was unresolved.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In July 2020, I knew little about cemeteries. As a result, I searched endlessly for a marker that was never there. I needed to clarify why his marker was not where it was supposed to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had a newspaper story saying Boswell had paid for his funeral and burial because he did not want to be in the potter’s field. If that is the case, then where was it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Records show C. Funck and Sons Undertaking handled his funeral arrangements in June 1913. I contacted Duhaime Funeral Home because they have Funk’s papers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They located a file for “Henry Bosville,” but the script from the quill had faded. All that was legible was confirmation that he was buried in West Cemetery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My emails to West Cemetery seeking clarification on the location of his final resting place went unanswered, and the mere mention of it put me in a foul mood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 2021, I’d had enough of the cemetery. But in May, a new lead emerged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had been put in contact with Mike Sayman, Jr., former president of the Bristol Historical Society and Chairman of Bristol’s cemetery commission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to Mike’s connections, he extracted an internment record for Boswell from West Cemetery. The card showed the location of the lot and the lot owner as “soldiers.” According to Mike, this indicated that Bristol’s chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), Gilbert W. Thompson Post No. 13, paid for the grave. This was an unexpected revelation.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;GAR&nbsp;was a fraternal organization comprised of Civil War veterans. There were posts in every state. Eight-five posts were scattered through Connecticut, including Bristol, whose post was established in 1868, while Forestville was organized in the summer of 1884.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would the G.A.R. take care of Boswell’s burial arrangements? It was certainly possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although there was a story in the local newspaper stating Boswell paid for his funeral arrangements, I suspected this was not the case because, at the time of his death, Henry was living in Bristol’s Almshouse (home for the impoverished), and his friends were pressed into service to plan his funeral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the time of his death in 1913, there were 143 Civil War veterans buried in Bristol, with 120 in West Cemetery. Due to Boswell’s popularity, background, and informal association with the Massachusetts regiment, the GAR members may have felt a kinship with Henry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They would have shared the language of war; the sights and sounds, the local food, the accents, and customs would all have been familiar. It is likely that the GAR as an organization donated the plot or individual members did so.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is purely speculative, but perhaps someone like William Hutchison played a part in the arrangements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hutchison served with the 12th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry and was later commissioned as a lieutenant with the 15th Regiment Corps D’Arique (black regiment) and the “99th United States Colored Infantry.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or, maybe, Carlos Neal. Neal served in the Twenty-First Connecticut Infantry and was at the front during the Siege of Petersburg, where Boswell said he was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there is William Renfree, who moved to Bristol around 1880 and lived here until 1911. He served in the Connecticut 1<sup>st</sup> Calvary and was part of Wilson's raid, which came within two miles of the farm where Boswell was enslaved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The area near the obelisk is not exclusively reserved for veterans, but it certainly seems that way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 15 graves below the obelisk in the area where Boswell is buried, roughly a 20X30 section. Thirteen are veterans; eight were interned before Boswell died.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the internment cards, we had Boswell’s location down to a 12 ft area. The issue was the marker next to him, John Wartschow, and which direction he was laying. According to Sayman, his tombstone was erected ten years after his death (on January 31, 1929).</p>

<p>A review of Bristol’s G.A.R records was in order. However, where were they?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Historical Society? Bristol Public Library? A private collector?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tracked them down to the Connecticut State Library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In September 2022, I visited the state library to examine the records. They are primarily handwritten and detail meeting minutes, members, dues, and group functions. Unfortunately, there were references to Henry Boswell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One year later, I returned, audited my previous work, and expanded the search to Forestville’s GAR post. The search produced the same results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The records of West Cemetery had nothing more to offer; the funeral records were no longer legible, and the GAR records produced no references to Boswell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now what?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wasn’t sure until the first time I heard, “Rit, we can use ground penetrating radar equipment to find him.” I was all in, and it did not need to be repeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Saman first said it to me in West Cemetery while we walked the cemetery discussing Boswell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022 and then 2023, we had on-and-off discussions about its use and deployment. I was confident that it would happen in the fall of 2023, but the matter was put off until the fall of 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the ground radar delayed until 2024 and research of his life in Bristol stalled, I decided a visit to Virginia was necessary to find documents and visit the area where Boswell was enslaved.</p>
