<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern softball team made it back to .500 on Wednesday as the Lancers scooped up a 6-2 victory over Middletown from the Thunderdome on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals moved to 7-7 overall as the program is a perfect 6-0 from home this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ali Tellier, Eastern’s pitching sensation, threw a complete game gem but also got the job accomplished from the plate as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She smacked out a two-run homer while Gracie Browne added two hits over a stingy offensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, outfielder Alex Shorette made the play of the afternoon – making a diving catch over the final inning of play – to preserve the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back in action on Thursday, taking on non-conference foe Pomperaug at 5 p.m. from King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, Eastern gets its one and only crack against Plainville – on the road – starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The Eastern girls lacrosse program wasted little time against Middletown on Wednesday night, smashing the squad by a 17-5 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading the offensive charge was Emma Stavens – scoring more goals that the entire Blue Dragons did that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens dropped in seven goals to pace the Eastern attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joining the offensive parade was Ciara Collins with four goals, Vanessa Drury added three, Leah Roy notched two while Allison Sullivan also added a goal to lead Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 17 goals were just one off the Lancers’ season high – scored against Lewis Mills back on May 3 (18-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense fueled the effort once again as Audra Porowski, Jayna Hatcher, and keeper Avery Ellis all limited Middletown’s scoring chances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern hopes to continue its winning ways on Friday as the Lancers ‘travel’ to play St. Paul Catholic in a non-conference affair from McPhee Field at 6 p.m.</p>
