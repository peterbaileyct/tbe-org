<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The&nbsp;Bristol Eastern football team is tired of watching crosstown rival Bristol Central ring the brass bell every year on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s been the picture the Lancers’ program has etched in their collective memories since 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern wants to squash that tradition and do some bell ringing of its own.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters, despite key and critical injuries over the season, have the talent to win its first game against Central in quite some time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Lancers can get their vaunted running game cooking behind the likes of Jaiden Fore and the rest of the troops, Turkey Day is going to be a good one for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the Lancers on Thanksgiving (not knowing the full injury report and possible marking period implications):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Anthony Julius (looking for his first Thanksgiving Day win as head coach)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date and Time of the Clash</strong>: The teams square off on Thanksgiving morning at 10:30 am from historic Muzzy Field in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last BC showdown (2021)</strong>: Over a tough day chasing Central’s Victor Rosa all over the field, the Rams were able to tally a 38-8 win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Eastern trails in the all-time series 37-23-2. Central has won six consecutive games on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Series Fact</strong>: The Lancers last won on Turkey Day in 2015, posting a 20-18 victory. It was the eighth consecutive win by Eastern over Central – the Lancers best streak against the Rams over the holiday tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>: Brady Brown (sr. WR/OLB/injured); Jeremy Kolloverja (sr. WR/LB/injured); Joe Arborio (sr, OL/DL), Austin Shorette (sr. TE/DE); Connor Gimpl (sr. TE/DL); Cooper Harris (sr. OL/DL); Trent Dubois (sr. TE/DL), Fassa Kamano (sr, WR/DB); Wyatt Scarritt (jr. OL/DL); Kamden Laprise (so. QB/injured); Ray Andrews (jr. WR/DB); Kyle Babin (sr. WR/DB); Jaiden Fore (jr. RB/LB); Josh Aubin (sr. RB/LB); Adam Zavecz (jr. TE/LB); Diandre Diaz-Bazilio (jr. OL/DL), Isaiah Monroe-Shaw (jr. OL/DL), Zion Otero (jr. WR/DB), Alex Corvo (so, QB), Chase Dauphinee (so. WR/DB); Michael Sherrill (jr. DE/LB), Hunter Wells (so. OL/DL), Gavin Damboise (so. K), Jack Hartley (so. WR/DB), Zaveyn Tate (so. WR/OLB), Randy DeNoto (so. TE/DL), Jason Bunker (so. WR/DB), Ryan Corvo (so. WR/DB).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern Team Record</strong>: 3-6 overall, winners in three of its four past games including a huge 27-24 comeback victory over Farmington on November 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Eastern could win</strong>…The Kingstreeters, after a tough 0-5 start to the season, have all the momentum in the world right now – just in time for a big Thanksgiving Day bash against the Rams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That victory over Farmington was good fuel that the program used going into the holiday showdown against Central. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any time you’re coming off a win, you feel good,” said Julius. “And we talked about how we need to make sure that we’re laser-focused at the task at hand.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That task is now Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers could have easily been flirting with a .500 ledger this season if its showdown against RHAM (23-20 loss after leading by twenty) didn’t end up in complete disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that was September and now, it’s the biggest game of the season in November: Bristol’s version of the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is where all the stars come out to shine and one of those bright lights is Eastern junior Jaiden Fore (176 carries, 802 yards, 13 touchdowns – all team highs for Eastern).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fore will knock over anything that moves and is in position to possibly capture 1,000 yards for the season if Central’s defense misses some tackles along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He averages 4.6 carries-per-carry and is a gamer whenever he takes the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray Andrews can also make some noise on the ground for the Lancers, tallying 6.6 yards-per-rush.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he can shake a defender or two, he can get to the house.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Corvo (28 passes, 207 yards) has done a credible job filling in at quarterback for the injured Kamden Laprise (16-for-32, 222 yards, two TDs) and when Eastern does decide to pass, Kyle Babin, Austin Shorette and Andrews have been primary receivers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the play of sophomore Zaveyn Tate (two fumble recoveries, eight tackles-for-losses) has been missed over the last couple games, but the hope is he’s back for the big game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Aubin can track down an elusive receiver and expect some big things defensively from Cooper Harris, Connor Gimpl, Shorette and even Randy DeNoto who has earned some playing time over second half play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hunter Wells has played well over the second half of the campaign, and it will take all hands-on deck to slow down Blair and Central’s offense. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Injuries have played a role in keeping some of Eastern’s major weapons on the sidelines as Brady Brown, the versatile Jeremy Kolloverja, and Laprise – among others – have been sorely missed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the 11 athletes Eastern puts out there on the field – on either side of the ball – are more than capable in winning this game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everybody in town talks the bell game all the time,” said Julius. “I know the kids are going to be excited.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The X-Factor</strong>…It’s sophomore Jack Hartley.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With injuries and the like this past season, Hartley did exactly what Julius and the Eastern program needed him to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can fill in at QB, taking the ball into the abyss on quarterback draws – averaging 4.7 yards-per-carry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley is second on the squad in kickoff return yardage with 103 (17.2 yards-per-return) and is one of the leading tacklers on the squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore has made invaluable contributions all season long and Thanksgiving might be the time the entire city gets to see those abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s leading tackler Adam Zavecz also might be that x-factor Eastern will be looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Farmington, the junior made two huge interception returns, can run with the football and is simply looking to hit someone on the gridiron.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s ready for the holiday challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sophomore kicker Gavin Damboise can help control the game with a long kickoff or two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern can’t</strong>…Allow Tre Blair to run wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central continues those quarterback draws with Blair being the recipient of the ball, it could be a long day for the Lancers if the senior is not contained.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair might be the most athletic player on the field on Thanksgiving and is not afraid of the big moment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can pass the ball a time or two, thrust himself into contact and keep his legs churning, and ultimately can cause Eastern defenders to run in circles if not careful.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal is to keep the ball out of Blair’s hands and hope to slow down Nik Salinas, Johnny Rios and Carmelo Thompson (if healthy) if the pigskin comes their way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won’t pass a ton – same with Eastern – but a critical first down toss could spoil a drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern must keep Blair in check and everything else should fall into place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>…This game is going to be a good one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between two talented athletes in the form of Fore and Blair, you’re going to see a couple rushers going back and forth and the winner will come down to the squad that can halt the other’s running attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this is a team game and it’s going to be the defense that wins this one in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has allowed opponents 28.2 points-per-game this season but Central averages only 11.2 ppg which includes those tough third period lulls.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers average a hair under 20 an outing and if the Kingstreeters can hit that average, victory could be in the air.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting to 4-6 won’t be easy but Eastern has all the tools to win this game – starting a brand new tradition with a victory on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know they’re going to put a great effort in,” said Julius of his squad. “And we could give the crowd something to cheer for.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And the winner is</strong>…Math might be Eastern’s best friend that day and there’s something to consider about series play over the years between the programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 1989, with a couple rare exceptions, this series has gone in cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Kingstreeters won eight straight Thanksgiving Day games, starting in 2007, Central has been in charge of the series ever since 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, like anything, streaks are meant to be broken and the Lancers are looking to bang on the pay window one more time this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why not collect against your crosstown rival?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get that paycheck ready… &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
