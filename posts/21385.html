<p>Penned by the Scottish Poet Robert Burns in 1788, the lyrics to "Auld Lang Syne" were set to a traditional melody just before the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Over 200 years later, the song has become synonymous with New Year’s celebrations; with friends gathering at midnight to belt a tuneful farewell to the previous year.  </p>

<p>Arguably the most iconic version of "Auld Lang Syne" is the 1947 recording by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians. The band leader first performed the song live at the Roosevelt Hotel in 1929 and continued the tradition for nearly 50 years. Popular musicians including the Beach Boys, Rod Stewart and James Taylor recorded their own take on the poignant holiday classic.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
