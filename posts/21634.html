<p><em>Blinded by the light, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>In January of 1973, the world was introduced to a young singer-songwriter from New Jersey named Bruce Springsteen. The American icon’s debut album&nbsp;<em>Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.</em>&nbsp;was released to positive critical reviews and ranks 379 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first single off of Springsteen’s debut LP was “Blinded by the Light.” The song’s folk-rooted sound and evocative lyrics were compared by many reviewers to the early works of Bob Dylan.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manfred Mann’s Earth Band covered “Blinded by the Light” on their seventh studio album&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Roaring Silence</em>. Their recording featured a lyric change; from “cut loose like a deuce” to “revved up like a deuce.”<em>&nbsp;</em>Manfred Mann’s Earth Band version of the Springsteen classic rocketed to #1 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart where it would stay for four weeks.</p>

<p>Though Bruce Springsteen has become one of the most recognized musicians in the world over his six-decade career, the Boss has never had a #1 hit as a solo performer. His smash hit “Dancing in the Dark” is Springsteen’s highest charting song to date, spending four weeks at #2 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1984.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
