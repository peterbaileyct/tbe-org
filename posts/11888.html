<p>Soon enough, the final scoring tally for the outstanding Donovan Clingan from Bristol Central will be known.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that complete scoring total will come at the completion of the CIAC Division II championship showdown -- pitting No. 1 Bristol Central against No. 2 Northwest Catholic as the two top programs in all the state duke it out from the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville on Saturday at 8:15 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Clingan has scored 822 total points for an average of 30.4 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into his senior campaign, Clingan tallied 1,421 points and goes into his final contest of his scholiast career with 2,243 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That puts Clingan in eighth place all-time in state of Connecticut and he could leap into sixth place before the completion of the weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He needs just 20 points to surpass Matt Curtis (Cheshire, 2,263 points) and 49 to catch Ryshon Rogers (2,292).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Central’s thrilling 54-52 overtime win against Wilton on Tuesday night, Clingan (30 points, 21 rebounds, eight blocks) moved passed both Jordan Williams of Torrington and Capital Prep’s Kahlil Dukes who each scored 2,228 points scholastically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dukes, a 6-foot point guard, played collegiately at both USC (University of Southern California) and Niagara University and currently plays for Best Balikesir B.K. of the Turkish Basketball First League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Williams averaged 36.0 points-per-game as a senior at Torrington before the 6-foot-10 forward played a couple seasons at Maryland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was drafted by the New Jersey Nets in the second round in 2011 and averaged 4.6 points and 3.6 rebounds-per-game over his one NBA season -- going to Atlanta in the trade for Joe Johnson before moving on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Clingan has moved by both those incredible scoring machines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Including just non-public schools, Clingan is currently sixth in state history in total points scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Clingan has dropped in 360 baskets, including 10 three-pointers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s also first on the Central squad in free throws made with 92.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
