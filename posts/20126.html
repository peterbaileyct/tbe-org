<p>When it came to the Thanksgiving Day football showdown between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern, one squad came streaking into the decades of the 2010s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had the momentum to start and for the first five games between the schools, the Kingstreeters were in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over the last six pigskin games, the Rams have assumed control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ups and downs aren’t unusual between the schools as each program held the bell for at least a half-decade of the 2010s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this edition, we’ll review the last 11 games between BC/BE, starting with Eastern’s victory in 2010:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2011 – Bristol Eastern, 21-14:</strong>&nbsp;The Lancers led 21-0 but had to hang on to dear life as Eastern grabbed a seven-point decision for its fifth straight victory over the Rams. Eastern running back Jahmil Effend collected 118 yards on 22 carries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2012 – Bristol Eastern 17-6:</strong>&nbsp;Eastern won for the sixth consecutive time over Central, this time picking up an 11-point victory. A 49-yard pass by quarterback Tommy Curtin to Sean Aiudi in the third period gave the Lancers an insurance score. Eastern’s Nick Crowley rushed for 201 yards on 37 carries while kicker Jeremy Meccariello dropped in a 25-yard field goal – the longest ever on Thanksgiving.

<p><strong>2018 – Bristol Central 24-19:</strong>&nbsp;Justus Fitzpatrick scored the game-winner, a one-yard touchdown with 7:17 to play, as Central came from behind to beat Eastern by five. Fitzpatrick was exceptional as he tallied 171 yards and two touchdowns on 30 carries. He also went 5-of-6 throwing the football for 65 yards.

<p><strong>2019 – Bristol Central 34-32 (OT):</strong>&nbsp;In what became an instant classic, the team’s battled into overtime for the first time ever on Thanksgiving. And on Central’s first possession in overtime, Central’s Victor Rosa sprinted 10 yards into the Eastern goal to knot the score at 32-32 before the speedster rushed the ball in for a two-point conversion to salt the event away. Rosa ended the day with 31 rushes for 171 yards and five touchdowns – tied for the most TDs scored in a Thanksgiving Day game along with Washington (2000). Eastern’s Elijah Gagliardo made a Thanksgiving Day-tying eight receptions while Alex Marshall had 37 carries for 159 yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 – Bristol Central 38-8:&nbsp;</strong>On his way to UConn, Rosa busted the Lancers for 282 yards on 28 carries – actually leaping over an Eastern defender on one play in a stunning visual – as the Rams won by thirty points. Rosa’s yardage was the third highest total ever on Thanksgiving. Eastern’s Alex Marshall, switching to quarterback that day, made four passes for 44 yards while scooping in 90 yards on 31 carries and a TD. Central moved to 9-1 with the win, qualifying for the state tournament for the third time in program history.&nbsp;</p>
