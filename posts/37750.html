<p>NEWINGTON - When Bristol’s Adam Peters and Bunty Ray were inducted into the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League Hall of Fame on November 18 (Class of 2023), the duo left a legacy that is tremendous in scope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And wherever one player went, the other was quick to follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Herb’s Sports Shop, to the East Hartford Jets and finally with the Bristol Merchants, the Peters/Ray combination excelled at every stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Eastern and Bristol American Legion standouts were two of the best local players to suit up for the Merchants - winning both regular season and postseason titles and together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo had numerous clutch moments from Muzzy Field in Bristol and frankly, there are too many to count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at the careers of Peters and Ray - two of the newest inductees of the GHTBL Hall of Fame, Class of 2023 (this wasn’t part of the original write-ups due to the length of their HOF stories):</p>
