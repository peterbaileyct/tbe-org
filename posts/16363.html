<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is Thursday, Aug. 25. We kid you not. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mild drought conditions continue throughout the region.<strong> </strong>Last week, Gov. Lamont declared a Stage 2 alert. Therefore, water users should limit unnecessary water consumption.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, primarily sunny high with a high of 94 and a low of 64. Sunset at 7:36 a.m./ twilight 8:05 p.m.</p>

<p>Speaking of the TBE, Bristol humorists Sacco and Vanzetti are at it again today with their latest piece about Bristol politics. In the words of Robert Plant, "Does anyone remember laughter?"</p>

<p>The answer to yesterday's trivia question (Who was Mayor Frank Longo's opponent in 1973?) is James F. O'Donnell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 39-year-old, a lifelong Democrat until he switched party affiliations in February of that year, was a newcomer to Bristol politics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally from Lansdowne, Pa., Mr. O'Donnell was an airline pilot for New York Airways and at the time a Bristol resident for 14 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a letter to the Republican Town Committee announcing his candidacy, he wrote, "Although my experience is limited, my desire to serve is limitless, and I promise to expend my entire energy to working with you and the citizens of Bristol in returning common sense and sound government to our city."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a low voter turnout year, he lost 10,509 to 8,263.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until next time. </p>

<h2>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em> <em>People with financial difficulties may write </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> to be considered for free access.</em></p>
