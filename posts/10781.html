<p>BRISTOL - Round one between the Bristol Central (2-7) and Bristol Eastern (3-4) girls basketball squads commences today at 1:30 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been 17 years since the Rams hung a loss on the Lancers - February 16, 2004 to be exact - but Central is a confident bunch coming into the city series tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a rare occurrence, both squads carry records below .500 but with a victory over the Rams, the Lancers would draw back to even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern brings experience into the contest as All-Stater Ciara Collins is looking for another huge game while on the flip side, Central senior Lillian Sirois has the talent and skill to make the Kingstreeters sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a strange Saturday matinee between the two programs and here’s what to expect when Central and Eastern clash:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern at Bristol Central</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where: </strong>Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium - from the campus of BCHS</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When: </strong>Saturday, 1:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The storyline to consider: </strong>What tricks does Bristol Central head coach Steve Gaudet have up his sleeve as he looks for his first ever victory over the Lancers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern - Probable Line-up:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Ciara Collins (senior), Guard/forward/center/everything&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Janessa Gonzalez (senior), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Taigan Parent (junior), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Emily Piendak (junior), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Vanessa Drury (sophomore), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Lauren Ayotte (sophomore), forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Leah Roy (freshman), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Gracie LaMar (sophomore), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Amanda Noel (freshman), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Emma Stavens (sophomore), Guard (injured)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central - Probable Line-up:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Lillian Sirois (senior), Guard/forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Brooke Watson (sophomore), Forward</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Ella Watson (senior), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Kaley Laird (junior), Guard</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Callie Lodovico (freshman), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Madison Pikiell (sophomore), Guard</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Will Eastern continue the streak? </strong>Ciara Collins is doing everything for the Lancers and is looking for another big game Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And her numbers stack up with the best players in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, Collins averages 23.8 points, 15.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 3.0 steals-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s rejected 18 shots, has a double-double in every game but one and tallied a career-high 32 points in a tough loss at Windsor earlier in the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins has 1,200 career points and should be the program’s leading three-point shooter by the time the season is over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the All-Stater isn’t getting respect from officials this year but if allowed, Collins would play the entire thirty-two minutes like they were her last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins can hit from outside-in, isn’t afraid of contact and once she sets her feet, baskets follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez is having a strong senior campaign, posting 6.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She plays quality defense, finishes at the hoop, and averages nearly three offensive rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent (7.0 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 3.7 apg) has started every game this season, playing both guard positions for the Eastern team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s notched eight points on four different occasions and is a reliable three-point threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Piendak has started a half-dozen games, kicking in 3.0 rebounds-per-game while Vanessa Drury’s confidence seems to be growing by the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She kicked in a season-high 11 points versus Middletown and averages nearly three points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ayotte has been the first player off the Eastern bench as of late, supplying rebounding and defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s another player adding contributions in a reserve roll - posting 4.2 rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy, Gracie LaMar, and Amanda Noel all help fill out the Eastern rotation this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens (7.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists) should return to the squad to start February - ready to help the squad make its state tournament run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are confident and looking for a big crosstown win over the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Is this the day the Rams finally win? </strong>Speaking of confidence, the Central program has plenty of that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 2-7 ledger is deceiving as could be because before the Rams’ current two-game win streak, Central could have been winners of five straight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 30, the Rams had undefeated Gilbert on the ropes but fell by a 62-56 final in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the same rung true in the Platt (47-35) and Maloney (48-44) showdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Central is a lot closer than people think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lillian Sirois has been the program’s biggest scorers in years - pumping in right around 16-17 points-per-game and is a clever finisher at the hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s capable of a 24-point night and a good leader for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brook Watson can put the ball in the hoop, posting 6.0 points-per-game, putting together a 16-point effort in a victory over Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Callie Lodovico has been improving throughout the season and isn't far off from being a 10.0 ppg scorer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella Watson is also an invaluable contributor while Gaudet is going to Kaley Laird a whole lot more in the middle of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The programs victories this season came against Lewis Mills (50-22) on January 14 and Plainville (44-34) and hopes to make Bristol Eastern No. 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has some tools and cannot be underestimated.</p>
