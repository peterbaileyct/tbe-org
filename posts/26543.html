<p>Once again, a former Bristol Central All-State football star will be giving back to the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it truly isn’t any real surprise that Yale football standout Dathan Hickey is coming back to town for another summer clinic for kids.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Youth Football and Cheer recently announced the Second Annual Football Clinic, featuring the outstanding Hickey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The date for the event is Saturday, June 24 from the Bristol Bulldogs Football Field (Casey Field) over on Lake Avenue and is sure to be another exciting time for the youngsters to learn from an outstanding young man and his crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The clinic runs from 10 a.m. to noon. Check in time is set at 9:45 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;camp&nbsp;is geared for players from grades 2-8 and registration is free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;comprehensive football clinic will have Hickey and a host of talented volunteers lead the campers in skills and drills to help the young players improve their games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the release, “participants will be introduced to new concepts on both the offensive and defensive positions. This is a no tackle camp and is organized to increase the knowledge of youth players regardless of their previous experience.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey was a tremendous student athlete for the Bristol Central football program, helping the team stay over .500 during his time with the team, eventually turning into an All-State player by the time he completed his senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was proficient at multiple positions under Central head coach Jeff Papazian including wide receiver, running back and quarterback on offense while becoming a model defensive back - chasing down everyone in sight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was the ultimate athlete who could truly play - and excel - at multiple positions on the field and that’s why Hickey is the perfect example for impressionable youths to learn from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey was a team MVP at Central, earned Walter Camp All-State honors, earned two spots on the CCC South All-Conference team while ramping up a nod on the New Haven Register All-State Team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a National Football Foundation Scholar Athlete while also playing a little basketball and track &amp; field for Central as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His quickness and speed helped him in every sport he took up at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over an amazing senior football campaign for the Rams, Hickey rushed for over 1,400 yards on 199 carries while scoring 30 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually moving over to quarterback, the athlete threw for nearly 500 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Hickey’s scholastic versatility was the key and now, he’ll be showing off some of that ability when the campers come to the clinic on June 24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget how his ability translated into the collegiate game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense is where Hickey left his mark in punching his ticket to Yale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After making 48 tackles, seven breakups and two interceptions over a busy campaign as a senior at Central, he took his talents to New Haven and continued that outstanding defensive play, starting in 2018.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied 28 tackles as a freshman while adding 31 in 2021, forcing four fumbles and nabbing one interception.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Registration is available online and spaces are limited for Hickey’s Second Annual Football Clinic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A registration link can be found on the Bristol Bulldogs Facebook page for the event.</p>
