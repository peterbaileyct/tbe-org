<p>McCabe, the BAIMS school principal, discussed the different curricula and areas of study that will be offered to students.</p>

<p>“There are five pathways: theater, creative construction, vocal music, instrumental music and visual arts,” said McCabe. “All of those have spaces around the building.”</p>

<p>The black box theater will provide a more intimate space for performances and rehearsals. The room is outfitted with a mirrored wall and ballet barre for dance, and prop floors so that set pieces can be safely screwed in. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free acces</em></p>
