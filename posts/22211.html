<p>It was only a matter of time before the CT Girls Soccer Coaches Association Hall of Fame&nbsp;was going to honor the achievements of former Bristol Central girls soccer standout coach Tony Carrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mentor was an excellent tactician on the sidelines for the Rams, leading the program to its most successful period ever, providing his players a solid education in the sport and memories that would last a lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, January 22, the CTGSCA Hall of Fame gave Carrier a much overdue nod as an inductee of the 2022 Hall of Fame class from the Aqua Turf in Plantsville.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrier, a standout athlete from St. Anthony’s and Central, played three sports (soccer, basketball and baseball) scholastically – eventually coming back full circle to lead a couple of the Rams’ soccer programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He first took charge of the boys JV program while later coaching for Bristol Parks &amp; Recreation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His coaching tenure at Central lasted over three decades and his girls squads were extremely competitive, very successful and of championship caliber.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrier began coaching in 1973, sticking with the boys JV program at Central for 14 years – producing a winning record every season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His JV squads were unbeaten in 1977 and 1978 and over his first five campaigns, he dropped just three of 57 matches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the mentor went 134-32-18 with the JV squad before getting involved with Bristol Park and Recreation, coaching both boys and girls teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After seven years of co-ed soccer, Carrier made the leap back to the scholastic ranks at Central and in 1994, he was named varsity coach for the girls program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a few years of instituting his styles and program, Carrier helped to change the fortunes of the squad after a dozen consecutive losing seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1997, Central scooped up its first winning campaign – notching a ledger of 12-4 – and very quickly, after qualifying for the states for the first time in 15 years, the Rams were a recurring playoff participant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a couple seasons later, Carrier and the Rams really took off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was undefeated in 1999 and 2000 while the squad from 2001 lost just one regular season match.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That success saw Central put up a three-year record of 46-1-1 as the talents of BriAnne Bruni – one of Carrier’s several All-State players over the years – Lindsey Hermann, Allison Kosswig, Steph O’Neil,&nbsp;and keeper Tara Peterson started an incredible run for the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those teams could score while playing excellent defense on the flip side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 1999-00, Central scored 180 goals while totaling 24 shutouts that led to regular season excellence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those records established over 20 years ago still remain Bristol scholastic standards to this day for both boys and girls soccer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrier earned conference championships in a half-dozen of his glorious seasons (1999, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008) and those squads from 2005-08 tallied 41 victories and had 13 ties while drawing an excellent 34-1-5 ledger in CCC South play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was numerous individual accolades his players scooped up on a yearly basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under Carrier’s watch, he coached 100 CCC South All-Conference players, nine of which earned All-State honors, and also had one all-New England pick.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finally hung up his clipboard in 2011 as Scott Redman took over the program that fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrier was able to table several awards over his time as the mentor of the girls program at Central. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was named the CHSCA coach of the year in girls soccer in 2002 and in 2008, Carrier earned Coach of the Year by the CT Girls Soccer Coaches Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Carrier posted a record of 318-126-54 during his stints as boys and girls soccer coach at BCHS. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carrier was honored by the Bristol Tramps in 2006, receiving the Bill Garrett award and five years later, he was inducted into the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
