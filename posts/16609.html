<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Friday, folks, with temps in the low 80s. Enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monitoring the mayor’s Facebook page and it’s hard not to observe that between all his self-news reporting and personal appearances, how does he have time to be mayor? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relax, it’s a small, tiny joke. We can still do that, can’t we?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, Democrats, don’t get jovial because you went 0-7 in the last election. As TBE friend and wise sage Screwy Louie opined recently, “How did they even manage to win as many as zero?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ouch!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are we all still friends? Good!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of actual jokes, though, the Red Sox have the sixth highest payroll in MLB at $207,790,36, and they are in last place in the AL East at 63-68. They are 16 games out of first place and the Yankees, while five games behind the fourth place Baltimore Orioles, who have the league’s lowest payroll at $43,703,102. Yes, The Baltimore Orioles. What a joke!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
