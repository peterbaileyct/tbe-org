<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through RSCO's school choice program, Connecticut families can apply to three different types of free, public schools in the Greater Hartford Region, including:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>43 magnet schools incorporating specialized themes into the core curriculum, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); computer science; visual and performing arts; Montessori; International Baccalaureate (IB); and dual language. There are approximately 20 different themes across the system that bring the core curriculum to life!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Open Choice public schools in districts outside their town. This program is primarily for Hartford-resident students to attend schools in surrounding suburban communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Placement notifications for families who submit an on-time application will begin in mid-April.
