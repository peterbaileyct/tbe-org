<p>BRISTOL - There wasn’t any doubt who the winner ended up being between the Bristol and Middletown boys lacrosse coops last Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After leading 9-0 at the half, the Kingstreeters never relented as the home team smashed Middletown by a 21-7 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the tenth victory for the program (10-2 overall) as the locals have posted four straight wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since dropping a tough 18-0 decision to powerful Wethersfield on April 24, Bristol has outscored the competition 58-16 and the Blue Dragons were a part of that demolition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six different players were able to notch multiple scoring efforts for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ian Reardon and Jayden Glasper each tallied four goals to lead the offensive load.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brady Bell was also on top of his game, collecting four goals to help overwhelm the Blue Dragons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Kingstreeters, Chase Dauphinee added a hat trick while the combination of Vinny Howley (two goals, three assists) and Aiden Collins (two goals, one assist) helped lead the offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the ground ball front, Austin Brown snared seven,&nbsp;Brayden&nbsp;Dwyer added five while Ryan Spina and Aiden Collins tallied three apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper&nbsp;Max Stavens and Nick Martino both saved a ton of shots to keep Middletown offenders frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens stopped three shots while Martino nabbed nine saves to help augment the defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is in action three times this week, starting with its showdown against Edwin O. Smith from the lacrosse field at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is at 4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Wednesday, it’s the Kingstreeters in action from home against Danbury – starting at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the week in a special Saturday challenge, South Windsor invades Bristol for a confrontation at 1 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally on Monday, May 22, Bristol has its rematch against Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That final regular season match commences at 6 p.m. from Middletown High School.</p>
