<p><strong>Security for some of the best</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My oldest daughter, Jana Lombardo, and her youngest son, Preston, have been going to Watch Hill several times during the summer. They did this again last week, and while doing so stopped at the Watch Hill Lighthouse, which is open to visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there last week, she was talking to a security man on duty. Turns out he is or was from Bristol, but she didn’t get his name. She’s going to ask him the next time out. He’s been a security man for a number of notables, including Taylor Swift who has a cottage nearby. He’s also been a bodyguard for the late Aaron Hernandez, Brady and Donald Trump before he became president.</p>

<p>“He (the guard) was an interesting man,” Jana told me. “We had a nice conversation.”</p>

<p><strong>Gail Straun, 66&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gail (Mailhot) Straun died this past week leaving her husband, Gabe, and daughter, Meghan Blanchette.&nbsp; Gail was known to many as the administrative assistant for Frances Petosa of the Bristol Public Library, as well as for her large family of good people. Many knew her brothers, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having worked at the library, I found her to be sharp-minded, a solid worker and the wife of my boss, Gabe Straun. The two met at the library and had 26 years together. Beth Livingston, an employee of the Manross Library in Forestville, remembers her:</p>

<p>“Gail was a wonderful asset to the library. She was a great team player and always helpful. When she retired, she was greatly missed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Doolittle’s Crossing repairs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may have read, heard or saw the railroad tracks on the corners of Rt. 6 and Rt. 69 in Bristol being replaced. This area was once called Doolittle’s Crossing because of a popular business right nearby. There have been a number of accidents through the years at that location going back decades ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Circus Fire survivors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve written about the 1944 Hartford Circus Fire, and now have the names of Bristol’s survivors. They are Marion Linxwiler and her daughter, Mary Ann; Marge Eustice; Joe Thompson and daughter, Judith; and Gerald LeVasseur, (6).&nbsp;Gerald (Jerry) may still be here in this area. I’ll look further into this and report.</p>

<p><strong>Michelle Guerette -- Olympian</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of our successful Olympians from Bristol was Michelle Guerette, who was a second-place finisher in women’s single skulls competition at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She previously competed in the team event at the 2004 Games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A talented all-around athlete at Bristol Central, she was especially strong in girls tennis. She has been out of Bristol for some years now in having pursued further education and an impressive, productive life.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To Bristol native Davina Hernandez, once a member of Puerto Rico's women’s softball team competing at the Pan Am Games, while standout coach of the sport at nearby Southington High School.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
