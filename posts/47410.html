<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here we are more than halfway through June and Pokémon power is piling on. Let me tell you what’s happening over the rest of the month, and then get to this weekend! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article is a bit of a recap until the end. Of note, Pokémon Go turns 8 years old!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting Sunday, June 22, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., we have Community Day for Cyndaquil! This event happened once before and know here’s your chance to get shiny ones. Evolve Quilava (Cyndaquil’s Evolution) during the event or up to two hours afterward to get a Typhlosion that knows the Charged Attack Blast Burn.</p>

<p>Just a reminder for the raids, here are Pokémon and the times for each listed below, along with their locations:</p>

<p>Shiny Celebi originally appeared in Pokémon GO in the Distracted by Something Shiny Special Research story, and it’s returning once more as part of our 8th Anniversary Party. Once purchased, you’ll be able to access a Masterwork Research story, which are special kinds of research that are intended to be completed over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Ticket holders will gain access to the Masterwork Research story during the 8th Anniversary Party event. To receive the Masterwork Research, you must open Pokémon GO at some point between Friday, June 28, at 10 a.m. and Wednesday, July 3, at 8 p.m. After you’ve received the Masterwork Research, you can complete it at any time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
