<p>The somber mood at Bristol Eastern High School was palpable as a community gathered in mourning for the two slain Bristol police officers, and for the one officer still recovering from his injuries. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday night's shooting took the lives of Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte, 35, and Officer Alex Hamzy, 34, while Officer Alec Iurato, 26, was severely injured. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the day, Gov. Ned Lamont called the shooting a “senseless tragedy,” as he directed that flags fly half-staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamont attended the gathering along with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In every town I went to today, the people said they were 'completely shattered,' said Blumenthal after shaking each officer’s hands in a row on his way out of the main building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Standing outside in the rain were crowds from the Bristol community, as well as outside communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brittany Pelletier, 30, whose brother is a Waterford police officer, came with a friend to show support for the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It just really hits home, you already worry about your family all the time,” said Pelletier with her voice shaking and tears welled up in her eyes.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We grew up in Bristol," she said. "My brother knew Alex. It just kicks you into reality.”</p>

<p>Her friend Andrea Stolfi, 28, did not know what the right answers are to prevent these kinds of tragedies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m here supporting my coworker who’s boyfriend is in the police force, my dad and my brother are correctional officers,” said Stolfi. &nbsp;“You can't prepare for this until it happens to your child, and I think it's nice to know the officers that served, were very loyal to this community and obviously very loved.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The news media had a strong presence on scene, as reporters from various organizations talked to members in the crowd, while people shared their own personal stories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stephanie McBriarty, 29, said her older sisters grew up with Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They all work together," she said. "My family has known Alex and his family and for over 20 years. It's just not something you think that would happen in this community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm emotional, I will say that my heart hurts for the families,” she said with tears in her eyes. “I think my tears are for that, and for the officers that were taken away too soon.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Salvation Army volunteer stood nearby, offering refreshments to passersby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uniformed officers stood on either side of the main entrance as police officers, firefighters, official guests, families and community members who had gathered inside, exited one by one in silence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were tears, hugs and muted words of comfort as the rain poured down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually the crowds dispersed, when rain increased to a downpour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I walked outside, I was escorted by a young man named James, who offered to hold my umbrella for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The high school parking lot was almost empty. We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the drive home, I noticed many houses had replaced their white outdoor lights with blue bulbs, in honor of the fallen officers.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
