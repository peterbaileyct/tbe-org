<p>MIDDLETOWN – The revenge tour for the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team stopped off at Middletown on Tuesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Lancers dropped a heartbreaking 58-57 decision to the Blue Dragons back on December 16 in Bristol, it was time for Eastern to exact a little measure of revenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters easily stopped Middletown, collecting a pleasing 71-34 victory from Middletown High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 71 points was a new season high for the locals, surpassing the 65 Eastern scored against on Platt midway through January (65-37).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers improved to 9-9 and should be able to net a win at home on Thursday against Plainville, losers in 11 of its past 13 games, to move over .500 with Bristol Central on deck next Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown fell to 9-8 overall and were rolled from start to finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern sharpshooter Taigan Parent showed her extreme range once again, dropping in 23 points – including four three-pointers – to lead all scorers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh notched 15 points while filling her usual quota of rebounds, blocked shots and steals while Vanessa Drury, who always seems to shoot very well at the Middletown gymnasium, scored 14 while playing a strong overall floor game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors shot the ball extremely well from the field, outscoring Middletown 23-10 over the first eight minutes of play, and simply never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over first period play,&nbsp;Parent connected on three 3's in the quarter while Udoh netted three baskets, including a three of her own, as the Kingstreeters held a 13-point edge through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers continued their onslaught in the second stanza, winning the quarter 18-6, to seize an imposing 41-16 push at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury added half her points over second quarter play while Parent scored five.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were never threatened in the second half, winning the third quarter 13-12 before seizing the fourth (17-6) as the Lancers were big victors on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Remaining Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two games are left on Eastern’s slate over regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Friday, Eastern is home for Plainville and then on Monday, the Lancers travel across the city to the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium to battle rival Bristol Central (currently 14-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lone Senior</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friday night will mark the final home game for Parent (team-leading 14.6 points-per-game), a tremendous four-year contributor to the varsity program at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her efforts will be celebrated in a ceremony before the tipoff of the contest against the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 6 p.m. from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
