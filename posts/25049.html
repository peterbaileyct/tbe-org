<p>Linda was a CNA for over twenty years.&nbsp;She was a dedicated and loving wife, mother and grandmother.&nbsp;She was one of those rare gems that put others and their needs ahead of her own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She enjoyed spending time with her grandchildren, a sunny day at the beach and traveling with her husband David.&nbsp;She loved returning to her roots and spending time with her extended family in Vermont.&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning or late hours of the evening you could find her working on jigsaw puzzles, crossword puzzles or watching a horror movie on TV.&nbsp;She was always ready for a game of setback and enjoyed playing with her friends and second family at the American Legion.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to her husband, she is survived by her children and their spouses, Tracy and Andrew Koscho, David Connelly, Jr., Marriya Connelly, Jenna Connelly and James and Melissa Connelly; her grandchildren Austin, Lochlainn, A.J., Jocelyn, Jake, Charlie and Sean; her brothers Robert, Barry and Cary Nolan; her sister Mary Guerra and many nieces and nephews.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was predeceased by her brothers Terrance and Burton Nolan, Jr.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
