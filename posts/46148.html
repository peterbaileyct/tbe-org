<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grab your umbrellas and galoshes. Cloudy with a chance of rain and isolated thunderstorms in the a.m., then rain in the afternoon. Cooler with highs near 70 degrees. Not a great day for a picnic.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Memorial Day tidbits</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Memorial Day only became an official holiday in 1968, with the passage of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, and did not go into effect until 1971.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One origin of Memorial Day is that it started as a celebration of African American Freedom, dating to 1865.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another origin is that Memorial Day has its roots in Decoration Day, when people visited graves of the fallen, decorating the graves with flowers. also dating back to 1865.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A moment of silence at 3 p.m., a time designated by The National Moment of Remembrance Act, from 2000, is often observed on the day, as is the lowering of flags to half-staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year President Biden has set aside 11 a.m., for each locality, as a time for prayer and reflection.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">MLB</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Yankees are running away with the American League East, while the Red Sox may be relegated to the Greater Hartford Twilight League. If true, maybe they will lower ticket prices.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
