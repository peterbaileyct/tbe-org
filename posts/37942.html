<p>She attended local schools and after graduating high school she remained in Bristol to help with her family’s business, Pete’s Luncheonette. She worked at Pete’s for 35 years where she always greeted customers with a smile and a hot dog with meat sauce. She went on to become a cook at the Plainville Day Care Center where she introduced the children and staff to her favorite Greek recipes. </p>

<p>Mallie was very proud of her Greek heritage. She was a devoted member of St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Bristol, where she made many friends and enjoyed conversing in Greek with them. She spent many years working at the annual Greek Festival where she enjoyed the food, music and dancing. She was also a member of the Philoptochos Society.  </p>

<p>Mallie’s greatest joy in life was spending time with family and friends. Summers at the beach and weekly family dinners are just a few of the ways that she created memories and oh, what memories they are. Mallie loved to travel and always looked forward to her annual trips to Florida to visit her sister Anita, her best friend in life. Mallie also enjoyed memorable trips to Greece with her family.  </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
