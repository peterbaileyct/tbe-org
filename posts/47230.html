<p>Jim instilled a love of family and enjoyment of life. Papa was a baker by career and loved nothing more than celebrating his children’s many birthdays by baking special cakes and surrounding himself with family, friends, and neighbors.&nbsp; In addition to enjoying special occasions, he never missed an opportunity to spend time with family.&nbsp; He spent many days on the water with his sons as an avid fisherman and was a lifelong member of the Bristol Fish and Game Club.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every Sunday you would find him drinking coffee, talking, and laughing with his children and grandchildren.&nbsp; His dedication to his wife, children, and grandchildren is his legacy. &nbsp; He was cared for in the last years of his life lovingly at home by his daughter, Veronica, son-in-law Rodrigo, and grandson, Nathaniel Gomez.&nbsp; The family deeply appreciated the support and compassionate care provided by nurse Michelle Brino in the last days of his life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his life, Papa had many wise sayings that reflect his positive outlook on life.  One of our favorites, and the one that brings us comfort today is, “I’ve had a good life. I have lived in the best of times.”  </p>

<p>We hope you will join us in celebrating his life. Calling hours will be held on Tuesday, June 18, at O’Brien Funeral Home 24 Lincoln Ave. Bristol, starting at 10 a.m. until a funeral home service that will begin at 12 p.m. Burial will follow at St. Joseph Cemetery, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
