<p>ENFIELD - The Bristol Central boys basketball team is 24 games into its season and the locals have yet to taste defeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s 24 games up and 24 games down as the Rams entered the CIAC Division II fray will all the momentum in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program needs just one more win to establish a new record for victories in a season and have won 39 straight games since losing to East&nbsp; Catholic (85-48) on February 29, 2020 in Central Connecticut Conference Tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off its tremendous 63-56 CCC Tournament Title victory over Northwest Catholic on Thursday - the second ranked team, not just in the CCC tournament but in the state - is there any team in Division II that can knock off Central this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer should be no but a program like the Lions (22-2) could be that squad if everything went right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it’s hard to envision anything like that scenario taking place as Northwest - in the CCC Title tilt against Central - had some big moments against the Rams but trailed for the final 28:09 off the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once Central establishes a lead - with its unit of five seniors strong - it’s nearly impossible to make a comeback as the Lions experienced in Enfield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is a preview of what’s coming in the states,” said Bristol Central All-State center Donovan Clingan after the CCC title win. “We’re locked in, we’re ready to go and we’ve got four more games to win to win a ring.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Central program is on a collision course with destiny as the starting five of Carson Rivoira, Victor Rosa, Steve Alseph, Damion Glasper, and Clingan - a grouping of what could be five NCAA Division I athletes over various sports - display ability and a chemistry that simply cannot be matched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This squad plays for each other and mesh their talents seamlessly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It all comes down to heart,” said Clingan. “Everyone loves this, everyone wants to win. Everybody cares about other. In order to win, it takes everything. It takes heart, it takes [the right] mindset…it’s big.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team at Bristol Central is, frankly, the most underrated defensive program in the state as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s nothing even close like it in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proof is in the CCC semifinal round tournament game against Windsor as the Warriors - a high-scoring bunch - was limited to just 37 points, losing by twenty in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about Springfield Central, a squad that did not do anything offensively versus the Rams at the HoopHall Classic back on January 14?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 53-44 win by the Rams in Massachusetts was certainly impressive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And how many teams have been reduced to at or near 30-point outings against the Rams this year?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number reaches in double-figures with the state tournament looming for more like efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How much more proof do you need about Central’s tremendous defense?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s not just about Clingan blocking shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira always has his quick hands in the passing lanes, Rosa and Alseph are hiding in plain sight, scooping in steals, and Glasper is always looking to advance the ball on the defensive end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not a stretch to say that Bristol Central has the best starting five in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CIAC Division II</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are some contenders in Division II this year as the tournament commences on March 7 with top-ranked Central drawing a well-earned bye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest Catholic is second in tournament play, Conard (20-3) is lurking at No. 3 with sophomore Riley Fox in the mix while Wilton (17-3) could be a semifinal opponent for the Rams at No. 4 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holy Cross (fifth) and Crosby (seventh) are two very good Naugatuck Valley League challengers while Prince Tech (sixth) and Waterford (eighth) have both had very good seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, no matter what team advances, it appears that Central and Northwest are on a collision course for the CIAC Division II finals at Mohegan Sun over the weekend of March 19-20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told [Northwest Catholic coach] John [Mirabello] that” after the CCC Championship game said Barrette. “I said let’s do this again on March 19 as we walked through the [handshake] line. I know they’ll throw something else at us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a great game every time we play Northwest Catholic.”</p>
