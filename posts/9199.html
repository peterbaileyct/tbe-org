<p>STORRS – The Bristol Eastern girls soccer program, the 27<sup>th</sup> rated team in the Class L field, ended its season on Monday night in first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers battled No. 6 Edwin O. Smith and ended up falling to the Panthers by a 3-0 final in Storrs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith (11-2-4) advanced to play No. 11 Ellington – a 3-1 overtime victor against No. 22 East Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers ended its season at 5-9-2 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when checking out the CIAC website for Eastern’s tournament result, a strange score appeared at the bottom of the bracket.</p>

<p>Check it out:</p>

<p>Apparently, after the Panthers were done with eighty minutes of grueling action on the pitch against the Lancers, Smith challenged Eastern to an impromptu volleyball showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it seems like the Lancers accepted, falling in three straight sets (25-17, 25-7, and 25-12) to Edwin O. Smith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bus must have been late again in picking up the Eastern players in Storrs so what was the next logical thing to do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go inside and play a little volleyball of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what were the details of the match?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did outside hitter Ciara Collins lead Eastern in kills?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was Maura Cyr, a right side specialist, able to tally a couple aces along the way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is Audra Porowski as good a setter as she claims to be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about the back line play of libero Grace D’Amato?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And does Eastern team manager Victoria Kosciukiewicz even know how to record volleyball stats?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a strange quirk that a volleyball score somehow was posted along with the Eastern/Smith girls soccer result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was even more puzzling is the fact the Edwin O. Smith volleyball squad was in action on Monday, from Storrs no less, and belted No. 29 Wethersfield by a 3-0 final but the Panthers won by set scores of 25-16, 25-15, and 25-14 which weren’t the same tallies on the soccer results page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was the bout between BE and E.O. part of a volleyball undercard that evening?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will Eastern coach Scott Redman ask for extra pay for coaching – and losing – the volleyball match as well?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His record on the volleyball court falls to 0-1 by the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Seniors say goodbye</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The soccer loss by the Lancers was the final match for seniors Ciara Collins, Maura Cyr, Audra Porowski, Grace D’Amato and Victoria Kosciukiewicz.</p>
