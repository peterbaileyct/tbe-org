<p>Bristol resident <strong>Lisa Lindsley</strong>  is diving into the waters of Long Island Sound on Saturday, June 25, in her effort to raise crucial funds for cancer research and in honor of her daughter Elaine Dennis, a two-time breast cancer survivor. This will be Lisa’s fifth year swimming in support of her daughter and for “Team Elaine” in the Swim Across America Fairfield County open water swim.</p>

<p>Lisa’s daughter Elaine was diagnosed with breast cancer at the surprising young age of 21 and the Lindsley family has faced Elaine’s cancer battle head-on. Elaine saw triumph after her initial diagnosis; however, the cancer came back when she was 23. She has been on medication to keep her breast cancer at bay since that time. <br></p>

<p>Lisa swims so that research for more and better treatments can be funded. Swim Across America Fairfield County has funded $4.7 million to date for its local beneficiary the Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which has funded 12 scientists working on new cell and gene therapy treatments for cancer. </p>

<p>"My Mom has been one of my biggest supporters since I first found out I had cancer in 2015 when I was 21 years old," said Elaine Dennis, Lisa's daughter and a breast cancer survivor. "She was the one I looked to for support and strength every step of the way. She taught me that when you put your mind to something, no matter how challenging, it can be accomplished. My Mom has always put her family first. Even if she doesn't have the time, she makes the time. She wakes up early to train before work for the Swim Across America event and show her support to me and many alike. Her selfless actions don't go unnoticed. She has been my role model my whole life, especially through my cancer diagnosis. She has taught me more than she will ever know and I am forever grateful for a Mom like her. I love you Mom!!"</p>
