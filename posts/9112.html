<p>The postseason is here for the soccer and volleyball squads in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And starting this week, four public school teams will be making their playoff pushes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the list of squads that will be participating in state tournament play for the fall 2021 scholastic season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>Class L Girls Soccer - First round</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>No. 27 Bristol Eastern (5-8-2) at No. 6 Edwin O. Smith (10-2-4) - Monday, November 8 (5:30 p.m.).</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Oh, not again! The Lancers and Panthers will be battling for the second time this year. Back on September 17, Edwin O. Smith defeated the Kingstreeters by a 4-1 final up in Storrs. The Lancers have weapons up front (Emily Nelson, Ciara Collins) and a keeper that won’t quit (Grace D’Amato). The victor of this match takes on the winner of No. 11 Ellington and No. 22 East Haven. While the Lancers are last ranked squad in all the Class L field, don’t sleep on the locals. And if the bus is late after the game, rumor has it that Coach Redman will be buying the entire team chocolate chip cookies from Insomnia Cookie - directly across for the Edwin O. Smith campus (please, demand cookies from the coach after the game…).</p>

<h2><strong>Class L Boys Soccer - First round</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>No. 25 Wilton (6-6-4) at No. 8 Bristol Central (11-3-2) - Tuesday, November 9 (2 p.m.).</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The Rams have all the tools to make a deep postseason run and head coach Nate Jandreau has his team ready. With plenty of size, speed and ability, Central will be making a deep playoff jaunt. And whether it’s Mark Palma or Carson Rivoira up front or Beckett Hennessey on the back line leading the defense, the locals have every chance to advance to the quarterfinal round which would mean a date with No. 1 Ellis Tech (13-1-2). That would be a Saturday showdown as of now.</p>

<h2><strong>Class LL Volleyball - First Round</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>No. 18 Farmington (10-10) at No. 15 Bristol Central (14-7) - Monday, 6 p.m.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>It’s a CCC Interdivisional confrontation with a been there, done that theme. This is a rematch from October 1 when the Rams knocked off the River Hawks, 3-1. The winner of this first round match travels to No. 2 Greenwich (19-1) on Thursday. Greenwich earned a first round bye in tournament play. Central’s led by Maddy Lodovico (198 kills), Brooke Valentino (189 kills), Alex Rivera (514 assists), Olivia Clingan (99 kills) and Samantha Sklenka (395 digs). Central is a quality team that should advance to second round play.</p>

<h2><br><strong>Class L Volleyball - First Round</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>No. 23 Torrington (10-10) at No. 10 Bristol Eastern (17-5)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Off the CCC Tournament championship, the Lancers tangle with a quality Torrington program in first round play. Hannah Webber, Lauren Bender, Alex Shorette, Abby Jones and crew are looking to keep the momentum going off a strong CCC run. The winner of this bout battles the victor of No. 7 New London (14-4) and No. 26 Windsor (9-10). And No. 2 Pomperaug is waiting in the wings for a possible quarterfinal showdown.</p>
