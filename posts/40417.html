<p>Seats are still available for Saturday's free community-wide conversation at the Rockwell Theater featuring 1 Degree of Separation and its program, "A Funny Look at Suicide and Depression."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are around 350 reserved seats, over halfway full," said Arianna Therriault, Arts and Culture Supervisor, who oversees Downtown live programs and performances for Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therriault describes the program as essentially a comedy show aimed at ending the stigma of mental health, providing laughter in vulnerable times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are hoping for an uplifting experience for our community and look forward to providing a safe place for anyone seeking information on mental health," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program begins with the comedy show, followed by a brief forum, followed by half an hour for anyone seeking mental health services to visit providers that will be available around the theater, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The providers include National Alliance on Mental Illness, Bristol-Burlington Health District, Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Peaceful Mind, Behavioral Health and Wellness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therriault said the response to this unusual program has been very positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Laughter is a way for people to open up -- even about the hard stuff," she said, "so this is meant to bring lighthearted conversations to difficult topics.  We haven't heard any negative feedback."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The "1 Degree of Separation" website states, explicitly, that the show, with a subtitle of "A Funny Look at Suicide and Depression," is aimed at ending the stigma of mental illness through comedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Depression has one degree of separation: if you don't suffer, then someone you know does," the website states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following that statement is the group's aim "to bring dialogue, awareness, and acceptance for those suffering from depression through laughter and vulnerability."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The statement continues with, "We laugh at the dark stuff, because laughter releases the pain. We talk about depression, because no one should feel shame."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It concludes with this, "With an army of comedians, we hope to kill the stigma of depression and share stories of hope, happiness and triumph.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
