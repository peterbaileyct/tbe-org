<p>A collaboration between students, educators and community members transformed an unsightly traffic box outside of the Imagination Museum into a vibrant work of art.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The painting on the box near the Imagination Museum had mostly worn off and it was looking quite ragged,” Walter Lewandoski said. "So I received permission from the Board of Police Commissioners to decorate the box. I invited four former South Side School students, now at Chippens Hill Middle school, to join me.”          </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewandoski is an art teacher at South Side School, as well as the chair of the Arts &amp; Culture Commission. The veteran educator enlisted the help of South Side School Community Club members Elijah Simmons, Kenzie Simone, Alison Sample and Eragon Maher, as well as Board of Education member Maria Pirro Simmons.</p>

<p>With the artistic team assembled, Lewandoski’s next step was to acquire permission to paint the traffic box, which is property of the city and managed by the Traffic Division of the Bristol Police Department. The proposed artwork was presented to the Board of Police Commissioners who approved the project.</p>

<p>“They were very cooperative,” Lewandoski said, about the commission and Lt. Patrick Krajewski, who heads the Traffic Division.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The artistic design on the traffic box, which is located in the South Side School district, was chosen by Lewandoski to highlight the importance of the specials: subjects taught by a specialized teacher to multiple groups of children. The three painted panels celebrate the specials Art, Music, Physical Education and Library Media.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I, as the South Side School art teacher, wanted to focus on the aforementioned areas because we are the somewhat underappreciated while being incredibly important components to a well-rounded education,” Lewandoski said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The young artists began painting the traffic box outside of the Imagination Museum in November of 2023 and completed their work of art over the course of a month.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewandoski stated that he hopes that their painting will help the students leave a legacy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The design idea came together for a number of reasons with the motto ‘Leave a Legacy,’ which is part of our district wide educational philosophy this year,” Lewandoski said. “My wish was for these students to leave their legacy as well as spruce up what had become an eyesore due to the degradation of the previous painting.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
