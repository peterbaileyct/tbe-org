<p>Brendan Foley allowed 1 run on 2 infield singles while striking out 9 and led St Paul to a 7-1 win at Torrington Friday afternoon. It was Foley's 7th win on the season and 2nd of the week (he pitched a perfect game against Woodland on Monday). Tyler Semonich pitched the complete game and took the loss for Torrington.<br></p>

<p>Torrington got one run back in the bottom of the frame. Joe DiPippo hit a Baltimore chop over the pitcher's mound for a single. Walks to Cooper Suminski and Tom Rooney loaded the bases, and a wild pitch allowed DiPippo to score from third. St Paul led 2-1 after 4 innings.<br></p>

<p>St Paul broke it open in the top of the 6th. After lead of walks to Joey Tonnotti and Steve Morelli, Semonich bore down to retire the next 2 batters. Then Chance singled driving in Tonnotti, Kulas doubled driving in Morelli and Chance, and Daniels singled driving in Kulas. Daniels was out on the play trying to stretch his single into a double, and the Falcons led 7-1.<br></p>

<p>Jamie Leggett relieved Foley in the bottom of the 7th, and Torrington started a small rally that inning. Melvin Alvarez singled and advanced to second when Rooney walked. But then catcher Casey Cerruto picked Alvarez off second base, and that was the rally killer. Torrington failed to score, and the final was 7-1.<br></p>
