<p>Buckingham Field in Avon was not a pleasant visit for Bristol Eastern on Wednesday as the Lancers and Avon played baseball on a rainy and miserable&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;afternoon. The day became even more painful as Bristol Eastern lost a 12-8 decision to the Falcons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the beginning, things looked very promising as the Lancers jumped out to a 5-0 lead after two innings, only to see the Falcons come back via the long ball to secure the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored a run in the top of the first, as Owen Myer’s long double to left scored Ben D’Amato who had walked. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second inning, two walks and a single by Caleb Molinsky loaded the bases with two outs, a walk to Cole&nbsp;Chaivanik&nbsp;forced in a run, and then D’Amato hit a three-run double to right center to give Eastern the 5-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the third, Avon scored four times to cut the lead to 5-4, with Chris Beloin knocking in two runs with a single, and James Walsh following that with a two-run homer to left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon added two unearned runs in the fourth to go up 6-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Owen Myers relieved&nbsp;BE&nbsp;starter Noah Molinsky to start the fifth, the score still at 6-5. &nbsp;Avon scored an unearned run on a wild pitch and then Beloin hit a solo home run to put Avon up 8-5. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored two in the top of the sixth to close within one run at 8-7. Mason Harris drove  in both runs with a single to left,&nbsp;following a&nbsp;Chaivanik&nbsp;single and two walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon then responded with four runs in the bottom of the sixth highlighted by consecutive home runs off the bats of Beloin and Walsh, making the score 12-7 going into the final frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern threatened in the seventh. Two walks and an infield error loaded the bases with no outs. &nbsp;Chaivanik&nbsp;singled to center to score a run,&nbsp;but then&nbsp;two pop-ups and a strikeout ended&nbsp;the game and&nbsp;the Lancer’s chances at a comeback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern collected ten hits for the game, two each by&nbsp;Chaivanik, D’Amato, and Myers. &nbsp;Avon pitchers issued 12 walks, Eastern stranding eleven baserunners for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s record is now at 7-11, while Avon improves to 12-5.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
