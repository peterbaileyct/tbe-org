<p>BRISTOL - The girls lacrosse program from Edwin O. Smith was able to fend off the squad from Bristol Eastern on Friday, zipping up a 7-6 victory over the Lancers from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second consecutive one-goal loss for the Kingstreeters (7-4 overall) who have dropped three matches this season by just one score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has won 7-of-9 matches this season after a 0-2 start.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith is on a bit of a roll, posting wins against Windsor and Enfield coming into Bristol and was able to fend off Eastern until the end.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers nearly got out of the hole late, trailing 6-4 with 5:30 remaining in regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens and Shannon Philippon hit goals back-to-back to tie the match with 2:13 remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Philippon’s first varsity goal, assisted by Sarah Hartley, and came at the best possible moment for the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams had possession of the ball over the decisive moments of the affair but late in the fray, Eastern was one player down with a minute to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 13 seconds remaining, the Lancers committed a foul inside the 12 meter arch - setting up the go-ahead score for the Panthers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith found a player charging to the goal, splashing the ball in the net as Eastern fell by one, 7-6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens led the charge with three goals and an assist while Vanessa Drury notched two goals and tallied an assist.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several critical ground balls were picked up by Eastern’s Meg Krok which was a tremendous help late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have two chances to get back to the pay window this week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back in action on Tuesday at 3:45 p.m. in a showdown against Enfield from Alumni Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then two days later, also from the Mum City, Windsor comes to town for a battle under the lights at 7 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
