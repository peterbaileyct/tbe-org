<p>HOUSTON – For the fifth time in program history, the UConn men’s basketball squad have been crowned national champions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Huskies defeated San Diego State 76-59 in the 2023 title game from NRG Stadium in Houston Texas on Monday night, the team from Storrs moved to 5-for-5 in the championship game appearances – winning it all in&nbsp;1999, 2004, 2011, 2014 and 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Huskie fans all over globe were partying last night like it was 1999.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory, which will lead to the Huskies capturing the No. 1 ranking in the final poll of the year, means that Bristol’s own Donovan Clingan is a dual champion – putting a brand-new national championship title next to his CIAC Division II trophy he won as a member of the Bristol Central boys basketball team during the 2021-22 scholastic campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his last two basketball seasons, between Central and UConn, Clingan’s squads have gone a combined 59-8 overall, good for an amazing 88-percent winning clip.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both programs ended – or will end – the year as the top-ranked teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a sensational ride for Clingan and UConn, providing Husky fans with one of the most dominant NCAA postseason runs, perhaps, ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the championship game against the double tough Aztecs, the Bristol native battled early foul trouble but still loomed large on the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 10 minutes of court time, he was the ultimate disrupter on the hardwood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan tallied four points, three rebounds, dished out an assist, rejected a shot and nabbed two steals over a few very productive stints that led to the ultimate win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His first field goal, a loud alley-oop jam just minutes into his first rotation of the game, got the UConn faithful in Houston to rise to their feet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn led by 12 at the half and never trailed again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>San Diego made its run midway through the second period but never got it closer than five points.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the final horn sounded, there was a triumphant 7-foot-2 giant from Bristol jumping up and down, grinning from ear-to-ear, giving out hugs, hopping on his phone for a little reflection, and giving out high-fives to everyone he saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The center ended his amazing first year journey as a collegiate player averaging 6.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks over just 13 minutes-per-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He shot a blistering 65.5-percent from the field and when he wasn’t on the hardwood, Clingan was the biggest cheerleader for his team, checked into everything his teammates were doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The center ended up scoring 23 points, grabbing 21 rebounds, and rejected nine shots during the NCAA Division I tourney play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan accepted his bench role throughout the campaign, helping his squad win every tournament game by double figures during March Madness and kept the crew playing into April – making Storrs ‘Title Town’ one more time in front of several loud and excited UConn basketball legends who were in attendance last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an amazing journey for Clingan from his first game at Bristol Central as a freshman at Manchester High School, to his recruitment process, the dual CCC Tournament championships,&nbsp;for the Rams and an elusive [due to COVID] Division II title as an All-State phenom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, he adds a national championship to his resume in an overflowing trophy case of accomplishments and milestones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What Clingan has done over his 39-game collegiate stint at the University of Connecticut is simply remarkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t think pro scouts didn’t take notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for the likeable big fellow, all roads led to UConn – the ultimate choice he decided upon when attempting to flesh out his collegiate plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, playing on hallowed grounds in Houston with the national champs, could have written a different story for himself collegiately by attending one of eight other schools he was eyeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Georgetown would have loved him, Michigan as well, but that path wasn’t the school in Storrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, along with football standout Victor Rosa, have proven that you can stay, and play, in Connecticut and achieve at the highest level possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That duo could have gone anywhere, competed for higher-profile coaches and the script would have come out different.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two friends are doing something very special up the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now, all roads for men’s collegiate basketball lead to Storrs, Connecticut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Clingan will continue to write his story in Eastern Connecticut until the next path in life becomes a bit clearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congratulations&nbsp;to Clingan and the UConn Men’s basketball program for a fun and memorable year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have truly made the city of Bristol ecstatic with all the hard work, effort and determination you display perfecting your craft on a daily basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best is yet to come for this outstanding young man as the years unfold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of stories, this is a great opportunity to purchase my new book 'Dream Team' which gives a detailed look at Clingan's final season as a member of Bristol Central's boys basketball program - leading to the state championship in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's available from Amazon and is a good read on Bristol's 7-foot-2 center, and the entire crew from Central, before Clingan's travels to UConn commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's a fun read with awesome photos that dives into the amazing, undefeated season the Rams put together one short year ago.</p>
