<p>FARMINGTON - The 10th Annual Winding Trails Invitational on Saturday proved to be another showcase event for Bristol Central boys cross country stud Frankie Porrini - and the Rams program - as he continues to show his scholastic dominance in every race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini was the overall winner of the boys event that afternoon, squaring away a tremendous time of 16:04 in the large school division heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s another first place finish for Porrini, an athlete that will continue to shine over the back-half of the scholastic fall campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central came in sixth place overall in Farmington, ending the contest with a 138 point total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ top-six at the event also featured Chris Roy who placed in the top 10 by crossing the finish line in 17:30 - good for tenth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Patrick Wininger (26th, 18:08), Lance Archibald (35th, 18:37), Nick DiMatteo (66th, 20:25), and Scott Petrosky (70th, 20:41) rounded out a very good weekend for the boys program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the week, the Rams were in action from Plainville Middle School on Tuesday - squaring off against both Plainville and Middletown in CCC South action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central showed no mercy, spinning the Blue Devils 19-39 and downed the Blue Dragons 15-42.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams moved to a perfect 4-0 in CCC South races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central nabbed five of the top seven places that afternoon on the relatively flat course in Plainville to secure the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, Porrini took charge and won another event - this time finishing in 17:09.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy was also on his game, taking the runner-up position with a finish of 18:15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville’s Chase McNamara (third place, 18:44) ran well for the home team but didn’t have enough teammates close enough behind him to help make a dent in the overall scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger earned fourth place with a finish of 19:14 while Archibald (19:44) was thirty seconds behind for fifth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to round out the day for the victors, DiMatteo (21:53) placed seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“Great week [for] Bristol Central cross country,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk via Twitter. “[The] boys [are] 4-0 after beating Middletown and Plainville. [The] Winding Trails Invite brought lots of personal records and [a] first place run for Frankie Porrini.”</p>
