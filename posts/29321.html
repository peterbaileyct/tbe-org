<p>BRISTOL – Can we start getting excited about the return of scholastic football next month?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practices are soon going to be ramping up and that means the program at Bristol Central will be hitting the turf.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will engage in their usual array of Central Connecticut Conference teams this season plus a game against a Connecticut Football Alliance opponent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will remain a Class L program and will look to rebound a bit from a 2-8 campaign (1-6 CCC Tier 2) which included a big Thanksgiving Day victory over Bristol Eastern last year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will be home for their Alliance football clash while enjoying four home showdowns from the turf field at Bristol Central overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the biggest game every season, Central and Eastern will collide on Thanksgiving &nbsp;(November 23) in what will be another extremely competitive bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, after opening the season at the always challenging Windsor program on September 9 (7 p.m.), the locals square off against longtime rival New Britain at Willow Brook Stadium during Week 2 (Friday, September 15, 7 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central opens its home portion of its slate on September 22 against Fairfield Warde (7 p.m.) for its CT Alliance showdown bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern battled Fairfield Warde last season on September 23, falling by a 27-7 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warde finished last season at 5-5 after a tremendous start to the season but the team faded late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end September, Central travels to Enfield for a CCC showdown (September 29, 6 p.m.). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over its final six games, in a weird quirk, Central plays half of its remaining games on Thursdays.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams host Berlin on Thursday, October 5 and after the bye week, Central takes a field trip to Manchester (Friday, October 20).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central completes play in October with a CCC confrontation against Wethersfield (October 27, 6 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the final month of the season, the Rams takes its best shot against Middletown on Thursday, November 2 while eight days later, Central plays its final road game of the season at Newington (November 10, Alumni Field, 6:30 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about the Turkey Day special against Eastern at 10:30 a.m. from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the Rams defeated the Kingstreeters 13-6 and have won seven straight games against the Lancers. <br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four of its past five games against Eastern were decided by one touchdown or less.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practice officially opens on August 19 and expect Central to hit the 2023 season with zest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
