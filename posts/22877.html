<p>At peace now, Keith earned it and will be celebrated for an impressive personal and professional life. He had a passion for music and at the age of 9 picked up his first guitar. His love of playing led him to be the lead guitarist and vocalist in many bands over the years. He enjoyed the comradery and beating on the big bass drum with the St. Peters Drum Corps in Torrington. He loved to compose music, sing, and entertain those around him. As an outdoorsman with a guitar, Keith also loved camping, jamming by the fire, and trips to New Hampshire with family and friends. He loved to travel, gather with family, and dote over his grandchildren. Keith was a funny, kind, and generous soul.   </p>

Earning a Bachelor’s in Engineering at Naugatuck Valley Community College, he dedicated over 20 years with Waring Products, Torrington &amp; Sensio in Montreal, and New York as a Senior Project Engineer.  Keith designed numerous patented products, including the one he was most proud of, the Drew Barrymore ® Kitchen Appliance Line. Keith made many trips to China to assist in product manufacturing and reveled in the experience of working abroad.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
