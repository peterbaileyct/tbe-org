<p>BRISTOL - Very quickly, over a three-game stint in postseason play, the girls basketball team from St. Paul Catholic has absolutely caught fire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quality 15-5 regular season campaign, the Falcons opened up the annual Naugatuck Valley League Tournament as the No. 3 seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The field was a good one as No. 2 Torrington and top ranked Holy Cross were the teams to beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But St. Paul defeated both those squads along the way as the program from Bristol went for the clean sweep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On February 18, the Falcons defeated No. 6 Oxford 64-30 in quarterfinal play and in the semifinals, the locals topped Torrington 47-44.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally on Thursday night from Kennedy High School in Waterbury, it was St. Paul against No. 1 Holy Cross (20-3) in what turned into an epic final's bout for the NVL title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on January 31, the Falcons dropped Cross 76-71 to end the Crusaders 57-game win streak in NVL play and the rematch did not disappoint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was close throughout and as the contest was knotted at 38-38 through three quarters of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons were able to hold Cross to just nine fourth quarter points as St. Paul was crowned NVL champs behind a 51-47 win over the Crusaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul forward Audrey Tice, who started her scholastic career as a deep-dish reserve at Bristol Eastern before making her way over to Maltby Street as a sophomore, was named the MVP of the NVL Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in 19 points in the clinching win while Rebecca Kelly tallied 16 points and 13 rebounds. Kelsea Tefoe added four for the Falcons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tice scored 57 total points over NVL Tournament competition, good for a 19.0 points-per-game scoring clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivia Dahn, Haleigh Orzel, Zola Cudjoe, Kelly, Tefoe and Tice all played extremely well against the NVL’s top competition to win the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How good have the Falcons been in NVL Tournament play over the years?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul has won the tournament three times since 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holy Cross, led by Corinne Lomax with 17 points, had won the last three tournaments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cross went 0-2 against St. Paul this season and 20-1 against everyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the seventh straight victory by the Bristol contingent as the team is now a sterling 18-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that great postseason jaunt for the Falcons, it’s truly just the beginning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul is one of the featured teams in the Class M bracket this season, capable of making a deep run and quite possibly winning it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol school is ranked eighth and will be home for a couple games if everything works out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons tackles No. 25 Grasso Tech (6-11) to open Class M play as teams with a .350 winning percentage are part of the tournament mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grasso has the fewest victories in all the Class M bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If St. Paul advances from its first round game on Tuesday (6:30 p.m.), the winner of No. 9 Seymour and No. 24 Norwich Tech awaits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A showdown against top-ranked East Hampton (19-1) is a possibility in quarterfinal play for the Falcons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Class M bracket is chocked full of competitive squads which also includes No. 2 Immaculate, No. 3 Valley Regional, No. 4 Bacon Academy and fifth ranked Coginchaug - all carrying 17-3 regular season ledgers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul is one of three teams that come into state tournament play with a 15-5 record along with No. 6 Granby Memorial and No. 7 Cromwell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansonia, at 7-13, snuck into postseason play with the final slot in Class M - ranked 28th overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
