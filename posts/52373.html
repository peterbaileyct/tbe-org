<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many there said words to affect Joe were a great person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John, a long time friend and Vietnam veteran, had the most important thing to say.&nbsp; During the Battle of Iwo Jima Joe transported the wounded. Joe took it upon himself, at 18. If the Marine was severely wounded, not take him to the rear Aid Station but directly to the Hospital Ship without orders. If they did not have room to take the wounded Marine then Joe took him to another Medical Ship. A number of Marines' lives were saved thanks to Joe's actions during the battle.&nbsp; John wondered if he could have been that cool at 18. &nbsp;</p>
