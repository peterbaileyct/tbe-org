<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - One of the weirdest sights to see on the CIAC website this year was the bracket line-up for Division I boys basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the bracket came out a short few days ago, the Division I set-up saw all 16 teams in the fray earn a first round bye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since all the state tournament setups are made for thirty-two teams, all the byes were not any type of surprise in Division I.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that meant top ranked East Catholic - last year’s Division I winner - earned a first round bye as well as last rated Westhill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Westhill, by the way, went 0-20 overall and could be the first ever team in Connecticut scholastic history to earn a bye in state tournament play without ever having won a regular season game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re in strange times with the CIAC allowing something like that but the rules state that every team in Division I automatically qualifies for postseason play regardless of record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the limited number of squads, all the programs in Division I earned a couple extra days to get ready for second round competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that includes the boys program over at Bristol Central, ranked 15th in the final Division I standings, after going 6-14 during a grueling regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, did any squad in Connecticut have a more difficult slate of games than the Rams did this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what’s the reward for Central in second round play?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another date against Northwest Catholic, the Division II runner up from one short season ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not exactly the team Central head coach Tim Barrette wanted to battle in the second (or quarterfinal or semifinal) round of postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After only playing Northwest once over his stint as coach at BCHS, his squads have played the Lions four times over the past 26 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That includes last season’s Division II championship tilt, a game the Rams won 56-36, while earning the win in the CCC Tournament title bout over the Lions as well (63-56).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that was last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Rams’ only bout against the Lions this year, Northwest defeated Central by an 80-43 final back on January 24 in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But NWC might be a bit on the angry side, even after compiling an excellent 18-3 record and seizing the second seed in the Division I mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ranked second in the CCC Tournament this year, Northwest was ‘upset’ by Riley Fox and No. 15 Conard by a 57-55 final - an unusually early exit by the Lions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first round matchup between Central and Northwest takes place on Wednesday night, March 8 in West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the tools to hang in against Northwest but it's going to be a tall order as head coach John Mirabello is one of the best mentors in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lions can employ a frontline that boasts giants of 6-foot-9, 6-foot-9 and 6-foot-8 which includes sophomore standout Badara Diakite and junior captain London Jamison.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guards Gianni Mirabello and senior Tanner Ostop will also cause havoc offensively as Northwest is stacked from top to bottom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, after breaking its nine-game losing streak with its 59-52 win at Bristol Eastern to end the regular season, has been preparing for this challenge but the two teams truly know one another very well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Jayeson VanBeveren is extremely familiar with Northwest over his battles against the program, entering the postseason contest with a 12.9 points-per-game scoring average and is always a double-double threat that can and will block shots while dropping in hoops from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore guard Carmelo Thompson (10.1 ppg) can light it up when the offense is flowing and Mikey McMahon (7.3 ppg) - Central’s leading three-point shooter with 28 makes - will provide scoring support as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joey Pikiell (6.2 ppg, 26 threes) is also a three-point threat while pesky Mike Allan (4.4 ppg) will nab his share of steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason Stokes (4.4 ppg) has played some big minutes over the past two years for the Rams and expect a little extra defense out of Aiden Lopez (2.4 ppg) and senior speedster Tre Blair (1.4 ppg).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central can get its vaunted high-low offense in gear at Northwest, the program from Bristol should have some early success in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, that can last all thirty-two minutes against the Lions but that’s asking a lot from Central and every team in the state in that situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lions will be up for this second round showdown and knocking out the defending Division II champs is probably something on Northwest’s bucket list.</p>
