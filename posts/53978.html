<p>The Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services department is gearing up for the 27th Annual Turkey Shoot Basketball Free Throw Contest, an exciting event for children ages 4 to 13. The contest will be held on&nbsp;Saturday, Nov. 23, at the Chippens Hill Middle School gymnasium.</p>

<p>The Turkey Shoot offers young basketball enthusiasts a chance to showcase their shooting skills while participating in a fun, festive family event right before Thanksgiving. Children aged 4-13, paired with an adult of their choice, will attempt 10 foul shots and 3 shots of their choice. The team with the best performance in each age division will win a&nbsp;$25 gift certificate to Price Chopper, which can be used to purchase a turkey for the holiday.</p>

It’s a fun, laid-back way to kick off the holiday season."</p>
