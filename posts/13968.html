<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the Class LL state championship game approaches between the Bristol Central and Southington softball programs, the excitement continues to build.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second ranked Knights and fifth rated Rams have all the tools to be a worthy state champion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the end, there can only be one winner and here’s a quick rundown of both teams:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A quick look at the Knights…</strong>Southington has taken on all comers this year, losing to just once (6-0 loss to Masuk in non-conference play on May 10) and that squad could be the number one team in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So could the Knights for that matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Central, Southington is armed with multiple pitchers who could throw several innings of shutout ball and head coach Davina Hernandez will slot those arms into the circle when needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Sullivan knows how to chuck the ball – helping her squad spin Fairfield Ludlowe (7-3) to advance to the title round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maddie Furniss and Stella Blanchard will pitch out of the bullpen and that spells trouble for opponents when those chuckers approach the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pick a position and Southington boasts talented athletes defensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Centerfielder Ashlyn Desaulniers (CHSCA Class LL All-State), shortstop Sam Rogers (CHSCA Class LL All-State), and catcher Kaitlynn Griffin have gotten the job done on both sides of the ball all season long for the Knights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington hasn’t encountered any problems in scoring runs during postseason play, notching 45 over four tournament games (11.3 runs-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that pitching staff has just allowed over one run a game, looking to keep that average in check versus the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In over half of its games this season, Southington has been able to tally double-figures in runs and can put those on the scoreboard in a flash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can the Knights put this one away quickly against the resilient Rams?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A quick look at the Rams…</strong>Pick a pitcher, any pitcher for the Rams and you’ll never go wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central could turn to Sophia Torreso (CHSCA Class LL All-State) or Alex Sciarretto against the Knights and the Rams would be in great shape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior duo carries ERA’s not worth mentioning and have a tremendous batterymate behind the plate in Lorelei Stancavage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso allowed top-rated Danbury just two hits on Monday and when she’s dealing, opponents start chasing right off the bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scooped up 12 strikeouts to help the Rams advance over the Hatters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense is always played at its highest level when Central takes the field as mistakes are few and far between for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the top of the batting order is a tough hitting crew as leadoff hitter Kaley Laird, Sam Sklenka, Stancavage, and Leah Sklenka are an imposing grouping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But truly, batters 1-9 can generates hits – including that slick pitching combo along with Sam Romano, Adrianna Lubrico&nbsp;and Mya Porrini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams would love to play some small ball, putting down bunts, advancing runners and stealing bases – watching opponents fumble and throw the ball away in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It won’t be that easy as Southington’s tough infield plays a top-notch brand of defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But opponents' mistakes have fueled several of Central’s close wins this season and that’s the plan for Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And maybe there’s a little more to it, frankly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping two games to the Knights this season, being outscored handily by Southington, isn’t time for a little payback?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams know that this will be warfare on the diamond and there’s an awful lot of pride from the softball program over at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central head coach Monica Hayes and her troops are certainly looking forward to the championship tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels rewarding to play for a title and I expect my girls to give maximum effort, accompanied by our fantastic support system we like to call our “ramily” at Bristol Central,” said Hayes. “What a fun way to end such a fantastic scholastic and athletic year at Central!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong>Will the third time be the charm for the Bristol Central softball program against Southington?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have only been beaten by three different teams all season long and in two of those games, Central was one hit away from seizing victory from its opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that third team defeated Central twice – to the tune of a combined 22-1 score over two games – and they will be in the opposing dugout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Southington can’t be too confident because the Rams have been rolling through the postseason and now are on the cusp of something very big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s the final thought here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take the drive down to DeLuca Field in Stratford and find out on Friday at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can smell a little sea air, watch a great game, and maybe see the Rams win its first championship since 1985.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, anything is possible…</p>
