<p>BRISTOL - This past Wednesday, Bristol Central football stud Victor Rosa finally made his collegiate football plans official.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And his decision wasn’t any kind of surprise in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa officially committed to the University of Connecticut and its football program, signing his National Letter of Intent in Central’s Auditorium alongside his family, friends, classmates, teachers, various coaches, and media in attendance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m come a long way throughout my football career, dreaming of those days since I was a little kid,” said Rosa. “There’s a ton of work that goes on behind the scenes that no one sees but there’s also a ton of love and support from my friends that helped me along the way, and I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa had one heck of a year for the Central football program, helping the squad to nine wins, a Class L playoff berth, and was the top-rated public-school talent in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Rosa tallied 2,728 rushing yards, scored 41 rushing touchdowns, made 50 tackles - three for losses - while connecting 59 passes for 850 yards and eight TDs over a busy season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior had other collegiate suitors along the way, even as the UCONN coaching staff turned over, but in the end, he signed the dotted line - staying in the state to compete for the Huskies.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa thanked his parents for their support, his coaches, Bristol Central Principal Wininger, and Stanley ‘Stack’ Williams at Supreme Athlete during his remarks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger recalled a time that the outstanding athlete played for him on the fifth-grade basketball travel team at the Bristol Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger saw significant signs from Rosa about the young man and amazing athlete he would later become.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When he looked at you, not only was he listening, he was remembering,” said Wininger of Rosa. “Every bit of information that he could collect from an adult, an instruction of a strategy, any type of thing like that, was absorbed by Victor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rosa2..jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9938" width="480" height="720"/><figcaption><strong>Wininger reflects on Rosa’s journey (photo by Herve Letendre)</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger remarked that Rosa knew how to put that knowledge to work and still does that to this day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s never changed as a person,” said Wininger. “He’s only bigger, better, stronger, faster and I think a great deal of that is because of the love and support of his family that he’s surrounded by all the time and the by his dedication that he’s put in.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You won’t find anybody who works as hard as Victor does…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Athletic Director Chris Cassin also congratulated Rosa on behalf of the Board of Education - compiling all the amazing accomplishments he’s made this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between the Thanksgiving Day victory over Bristol Eastern, qualifying for the state tournament for the first time since 1987, being announced as the 2021-22 Connecticut Gatorade Football Player of the Year, and All-State honors, Cassin put it all together in three words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not too shabby,” said Cassin with a grin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s your hard work in the classroom, and on the football field, the basketball court, and the track that have brought us here today,” said Cassin. “You’ve proudly represented your family, your teams, Bristol Central, the City of Bristol and most importantly, yourself for the last four years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re confident you’ll continue to do so.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then it was Central football coach Jeff Papazian’s turn to speak about the incredible journey Rosa was on for four years as a member of the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Papazian mentioned how Rosa made all his dreams a reality in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This kid is driven,” said Papazian. “We all know his work ethic, we all know his drive, and what’s helped to get him here….it’s hard to get to that point.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rosa paid his dues, put in the time, listened to his coaches and in the end, saw UCONN as the destination of his choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been blessed with ability and Papazian mentioned that Rosa never threw that ability and talent away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Some kids waste it,” said Papazian. “Some [athletes] just try to rely on their ability to get by and be great but the outcome of those two are predictable. This kid has maximized his ability every day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noting the recruiting process is difficult, what stands out for Papazian is what Rosa has done to get to sign that National Letter of Intent to play for the Huskies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rosa did things the right way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not everybody can do what you did,” said Papazian to Rosa. “Not everyone can be sitting in that chair, and you should be proud of yourself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Papazian also thanked Rosa’s family in trusting the Central coaching football staff to help him get to the next level, even when prep schools and the like came calling for the athlete’s services over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa later brought up winning the CT Gatorade Player of the Year Award, saying that “this award means everything to me, and I can’t be thankful enough to be placed in this category with other prestigious Gatorade Players of the Year is a blessing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I will continue to strive for greatness and continue to represent Bristol, BCHS and most importantly, the Huskies at the next level.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa also thanked the previous football coaching staff at UCONN for being the first school that believed in him and can’t wait to get working with the newly minted head coach, Jim Mora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I would like to thank Coach Mora, [running backs coach E.J.] Barthel, and definitely the rest of the coaching staff for believing in me as well and giving me such a great opportunity to play at a great school,” said Rosa. “I can’t wait to get to work and help turn this program around together. There’s a lot in store in Storrs. Just wait.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Go Huskies!”</p>
