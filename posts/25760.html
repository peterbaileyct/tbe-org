<p>BRISTOL – The winning streak by the girls lacrosse team at Bristol Eastern was halted at seven this week as the Lancers fell to Lewis Mills by a 10-9 final on Monday from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 7-3 overall, swept by the Spartans this season over two extremely close bouts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this one, once Mills had acquired the lead for good, its keep-away and stall-ball tactics did enough to keep the Kingstreeters at bay, and Eastern simply could not knot things up late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury splashed in three goals while Emma Stavens and Sarah Hartley added two scores apiece for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Kenzie Aparo and Kate Patterson each added a goal to the effort, hanging around with Mills until the final horn sounded.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are home for their next four matches, starting with a showdown against Edwin O. Smith on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South encounter is a rematch from April 10 when the Lancers were able to stop the Panthers by a 4-2 final from Farrell Park Field in Mansfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time against E.O. Smith is at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that stinging 11-6 loss to Bristol Eastern on April 25, the girls lacrosse team over at Bristol Central has won three straight matches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams won the day after falling to the Lancers, nabbing a big 14-3 bounce-back triumph over Windsor while spinning Enfield by a 9-4 final on April 27.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then this past Wednesday, Central made it three in a row with its 14-13 nailbiter against the co-op squad from Middletown over another big effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory, from Middletown High School, saw Central junior Katelynn LaPointe drop in four goals to lead the program from Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Lowe and Abby Duval each netted a hat trick, Emma Burciaga posted two goals while Rachel Wygant and Brooke Watson added one score apiece over the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] game winner in the last minutes [came from] Rachel” Wygant said Central coach Kyle Phelan via Twitter. “[Keeper] Amy [Pelletier had] six big saves in the second half.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is now 6-4 overall with all four of its setbacks by five goals or less and two by a single goal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have three big bouts next week, starting with a battle against Windsor on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match takes place on the turf field at BCHS starting at 6 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Central split the season series with Middletown 1-1. On April 10, the Blue Dragons held on for dear life to nip the Rams by an 8-7 final.  </p>
