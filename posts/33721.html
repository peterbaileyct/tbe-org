<p>Earlier as I lay awake, unable to surrender to sleep, I found myself contemplating the upcoming November elections. My mind kept going to Bristol and my oldest daughter, Susan Tyler, and her re-election campaign.<br><br>Susan first ran for the Council seat in District Two, two years ago and was the highest vote getter for Council. This was no surprise to me as she had poured herself into her campaign with the same zeal and passion that she has done with every task in her life, whether as the oldest child in a family of four siblings, or her previous career as a highly commended police officer for 27 years, eventually retiring as a detective.<br><br>Upon retirement she chose to follow her dad, Jim Parent, as a real estate agent only to eclipse him and build her own business as a broker and ultimately hired her dad and sister. She built her business not around the quest for money but the ability to truly work with people and help them fulfill their goals.<br><br>During her first term on the Council she has never subscribed to any party line but has acted and voted to the wants and needs of her constituents in the Second District. As she runs for re-election, our entire nation exists in highly partisan times and Bristol is no exception.&nbsp;One of Susan’s opponents has suggested that the “R” next to her name on the ballot stands for Racist, whether as a noun or an adjective. Observing her track record in life and the last two years on Bristol’s Town Council, you will find that the “R” stands for Responsible and Responsive.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="candidate-rasmussen-tuller">Candidate Rasmussen-Tuller introduces himself to TBE readers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the editor:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My name is Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller and I am running for City Council in Bristol’s First District. If you vote at Edgewood, Mountain View or Northeast, I am one of your Democratic candidates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself to those who may not yet know me. I am a lifelong resident of Bristol, having attended Bristol Public Schools. I now live in the Edgewood neighborhood with my husband, Ken, where we are raising our three beautiful children, Kaidyn (11), Isaiah (6) and Bella (5) who all attend BPS. I am a local business owner, recently relocating my real estate brokerage, AR Tuller Realty, to King Street. I am also a profitability specialist for a grocery store’s corporate office, covering over 150 stores in the tri-state region. I have my Bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management from Post University and am finishing my MBA from Quinnipiac University. I have served as a Commissioner for Bristol’s Economic &amp; Community Development Board since 2019 and was appointed to the subcommittee for downtown development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe that my education and experience make me the perfect candidate for City Council. I have a solid understanding of municipal government and balancing a budget. I have experience writing and educating to policies that ensure the longevity of an organization and mitigating the impact that unexpected expenses can have on the operating budget. I am dedicated to Bristol and ensuring the success of our community, businesses, and residents. I am committed to being your voice at City Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Economic development doesn’t happen overnight and it is also not something we stop working on once downtown looks complete. Economic and community development is the forefront of Bristol’s livelihood. Ensuring Bristol is welcoming to new businesses, and supportive of existing businesses, is vital to our success as a city, and helps reduce the tax burden on our citizens as we enhance our grand list with tax revenue from businesses. Helping the mayor and city leaders continue our development will be a top priority of mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, we need to move Bristol back to a strong sense of inclusivity. This should be a partnership between the city, local businesses and our residents….YOU! We have seen what I feel is steps backward over the past two years and it’s time for that to change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope that you will consider voting for me on Nov. 7 so we can get Bristol Back on Track!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
