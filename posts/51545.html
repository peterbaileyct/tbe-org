<p>When the call arrived, Bristol Fire Chief Richard Hart did not see it coming. Being honored as the grand marshal of the 62nd Mum Festival Parade, just wasn't on his radar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Well, I was embarrassed at first and very humbled," Hart said in a phone conversation earlier today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after sitting with this a while?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Humbled and embarrassed," he said. "That's the thing, I am coming up on three years (as fire chief) and to be bestowed this honor, that's the humbling part. That they would think that much of me to make me grand marshal of the parade is pretty amazing."</p>

<p>Hart will lead the parade on Sunday, Sept. 29, but will also be on hand at the opening ceremonies on Friday evening, Sept. 27, to honor this year's Hometown Heroes, members of the Community Emergency Response Team, and on Saturday, when he will be a judge of the Mum Festival Car Show among other activities. Early on Sunday morning, he will be at the Hometown Heroes Breakfast at the Elks Club.</p>

<p>In the release announcing Hart as this year's Mum Festival grand marshal, Mum Festival chair Jack Ferraro said, “His leadership and service to our community make him a fitting choice to lead our parade. Chief Hart's dedication to public safety and his many contributions to Bristol reflect the very best of our city, and we are proud to have him join us this year.”</p>
