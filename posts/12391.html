<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team had a couple tough bouts over the last three days - playing two very good squads as the Kingstreeters were looking to defend its home turf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the results from last Saturday’s showdown against Rockville and a CCC confrontation against Edwin O. Smith of Storrs on Monday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ROCKVILLE 9, BRISTOL EASTERN 6</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers gave one heck of an effort against Rockville on Saturday afternoon but dropped a tough 9-6 decision from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers fell to 1-1 on the season in the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams were challenged throughout and had to hang on until the final buzzer sounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never took its foot off the gas against Rockville from nearly the onset of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed 2-1 just six minutes in but a few minutes later, it was a 2-2 match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the half, it was a 4-4 stalemate and with about seven minutes to play in regulation, Rockville held a slim one goal lead (5-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three unanswered tallies by Rockville, Vanessa Drury added a goal that made it 9-6 - the final score of the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens led the Eastern offense with four goals while Leah Roy and Drury both scored over the losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Avery Ellis made some big stops along the way and Jayna Hatcher played well on the defensive end, but the Lancers just had trouble keeping up with a squad that was just a bit more of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>EDWIN O. SMITH 12, BRISTOL EASTERN 7</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday’s loss to the Panthers was a tough one as the Lancers dropped a five-goal decision in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one was a winnable contest and trailing by two at 5-3, Eastern made its collective move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury netted a score and when Stavens zipped in a goal as well, it was a 5-5 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith ended the match with a 7-2 burst as Eastern fell to 1-2 overall in the five-goal loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Upcoming showdowns</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern gets right back to work on Thursday, looking to even its ledger at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CCC South challenger Enfield invades Alumni Field on Thursday while the following day, Wethersfield hits the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both matches commence at 3:45 p.m.</p>
