<p>Two Bristol entities were recipients of this summer's Connecticut State Department of Education Mental Health Supports Grants program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The Bristol Boys and Girls Club of Bristol received $135,000 and the Bristol School District received $42,927, respectively, of the more than $4.5 million distributed among 48 school districts and summer camp programs supporting mental health services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement was made by Gov. Ned Lamont and education commissioner Charlene-Russell-Tucker earlier this month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grants for each district and summer camp program range from $12,000 to $50,000 in each of the first two years and are reduced to 70 percent of that amount in year three. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The funding for the competitive grant program is provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). This is the third of three rounds of grants the department is releasing with ARPA funding that address mental health support services for youths in schools. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
