<p><strong>'Coach</strong>'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve had a great time in my life in doing and being a little of this and that. No deep regrets. I would, though, have liked to have been called “coach” at one time or another. There are so many, including sports coaches, A fine example for me is Mike Giovinazzo, former basketball and baseball varsity mentor at my alma mater, Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>I saw his confid</em>ence on the job, and the respect he had from his players. He’s a great role model for so, so many young men. There are other coaches, too, many being a friend.</p>

<p>A fellow who has a great nickname is Jason “Coachie” DeCarolis. </p>

<p>My oldest child, Jana Lombardo, turned 55 the other day. Phew, what does that make me? She has given me five grandkids, and three great grandkids. I’m a lucky fellow. My ex, Dale Giramonsi, and I remain good friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best friends Donovan Clingan and Victor Rosa, former teammates at Bristol Central, were both seen on TV separately on Tuesday. Donovan was at the White House with his former UConn basketball teammates and Victor was on local television in scoring a TD for the school’s gridiron team.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t see Victor but saw Donovan wearing a dark collar-less, sweet sportscoat and a chain around his neck. Quite classy.</p>

<p>Jeff, 67, recently passed away. He was a widower and had his own landscaping business. He had worked for Bristol Parks and had a nice way about him in enjoying his work. I crossed paths with him on many occasions and each time enjoyed a pleasant conversation.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
