<p>BRISTOL - The lowest rated seed remaining in CIAC Class L play in girls hoop this year belongs to a squad from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And No. 19 ranked Bristol Eastern is more than ready for a huge second round challenge on Thursday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s going to take a little extra gas money to arrive at the Kingstreeters’ ultimate destination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers travel to No. 3 Edwin O. Smith in Storrs – with the UConn campus looming as a backdrop – for a confrontation against the double tough Panthers in what’s turned into another CCC state tournament bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third ranked team in the Class L field had little trouble dispatching No. 30 Farmington (56-32) in first round play on Monday and now has its collective sights set on the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith (20-4) has a ton of answers which includes senior Maddy Hughes (15.0 points, 6.0 rebounds-per-game) who will put the locals to the test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (11-11) will counter with Taigan Parent (14.1 ppg, 58 three-pointers) and a hungry crew ready for another upset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers put together a fantastic game against No. 14 South Windsor (52-46) during opening round play on Monday afternoon and hope for a similar finish against Smith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lancers used veterans and first year players to knock out the Bobcats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent dropped in 13 points against South Windsor while Eastern got a big lift from freshman Jayle Evins Mosley (team-high 14 points, six rebounds), dropping season highs in both points and rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between fellow freshmen Autumn Udoh (12 points, six rebounds) and Evins Mosley, the duo combined to shoot 11-of-15 from the field for 26 points while scooping up 12 total rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The future is now for the Eastern program and tonight’s showdown in Storrs is going to be a good one if the Lancers can get its offense into high gear and play a little defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A win by the Lancers would mean a quarterfinal date against either No. 11 Avon or No. 6 St. Joseph – both on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to St. Joseph 46-29 back on December 29 over a non-conference affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
