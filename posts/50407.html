<p>“The committee is taking cues from Federal and State guidelines, which seek to reflect on our nation’s past, honor the contributions of all Americans, and to look toward the future while focusing on shared experiences and the diverse stories of our communities,” stated Lee McFaddan, America250 committee chair for the City of Bristol, in the release.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next two years, the Bristol America250 Committee will work with the community on ways to honor the contributions of all those from Bristol who were part of our country’s history in 1776 when Bristol was known as New Cambridge. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The committee, which has met several times, has created branding and the tagline, “Honoring the Past, Inspiring the Future.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A branding guide is being developed specific to Bristol to assist businesses, nonprofit organizations, civic groups and others in ways that the branding can be incorporated into their events, activities and programs, which is expected to be completed and distributed later this year.</p>

<p>The Committee will create opportunities to engage the community in activities to commemorate the Semiquincentennial along with partnering with the Bristol Public Schools to involve students in educational programs and field trips to learn more about Bristol’s history and its role in the revolution and the formation of our country. according to the release.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
