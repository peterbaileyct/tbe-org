<p>GLASTONBURY - The Bristol Eastern softball team just missed out on hanging a loss against Glastonbury on Monday afternoon, dropping a tough 2-1 decision in a Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional bout on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glastonbury earned a walk off victory in the seventh and final inning, stealing the game away from the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Guardians are 5-1 off the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since dropping a tough 11-2 decision to Southington on April 11, the squad from Glastonbury is on a three-game winning streak, outscoring its competition by a 33-3 margin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern did not make it easy against the Guardians - refusing to make it a run-scoring fest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were in it to win it until the end as the Kingstreeters battled but simply couldn’t put together one final game-winning drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ashley Serafin led the Eastern charge with her second homer on the season, notching the only run of the game for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Brown added a hit to the effort while Gracie Brown played very good defense to aid the Eastern cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss was only the first setback for Eastern since the Lancers fell at Hall (6-2) back on April 4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 2-3 on the campaign but has a few home games to get back into the swing of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Wethersfield comes to King Street for a CCC showdown at 3:45 p.m. and on Friday, Eastern battles Conard (4 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the following Monday, Platt of Meriden travels to Bristol for a CCC South confrontation at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the following seven days or so, they’ll be plenty of chances for Eastern to get to the pay window and move over .500 before hitting the road once again.</p>
