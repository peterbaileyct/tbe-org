<p>As championship day approaches for the Bristol Central softball team, TBE is looking back at the last two squads from the Rams’ program to make it to the championship round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central put together tremendous campaigns over the 2004 and 2005 seasons, led by head coach Phil Pirog – no stranger to championship encounters – along with pitching sensation Breanna Gleason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a certain head coach from Southington was a defensive minded infielder for the Rams over 2004-05, helping the squad to two runner-up finishes in Class LL championship tilts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, the programs from Central and Southington have been part of multiple postseason wars – including the Class LL game in 2004.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will 2022 be the year Central finally gets its revenge against the Knights, a rematch 18 years in the making?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how the last two state title game appearances have gone for the Bristol Central softball program:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class LL Championship – June 12, 2004 (DeLuca Field, Stratford)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No. 2 Southington 2, No. 8 Bristol Central 0</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in 2004, the Knights and Rams battled in the Class LL finals in a very competitive bracket and Southington was able to topple Central by a 2-0 final – moving to a perfect 24-0 to cap a historic season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights allowed just two total runs that year which tied a national record as Southington ended up winning its 14th state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natalie Volpe struck out 10 to earn MVP honors against the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central shortstop Davina Hernandez played excellent defense that day as Southington scored both its runs via RBI groundouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason earned a tough luck loss off the two-run, eight hitter for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central managed to tally just three total hits against the talented Volpe but put some pressure on the pitcher from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jamie Matesky had a first inning hit for Central as the squad had two runners on early but Volpe and her defense wiggled out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended its season with a sterling 20-5 record and managed to get to the state title game the following year as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class LL Championship – June 11, 2005 (DeLuca Field, Stratford)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>No. 1 Amity 2, No. 7 Bristol Central 0</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After finally toppling Southington (1-0) in the semifinal round, the Rams battled top ranked Amity – another undefeated program (27-0) in the final round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the semis that season, Gleason allowed just two hits, Kristen Rinas tallied the game-winning hit while Hernandez played more amazing defense at shortstop to earn another shot at the Class LL crown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was a chance for the locals to final tally that one elusive Class LL title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Spartans were undefeated for a reason that year as freshman pitcher Lauren Bespuda got the best of Gleason that day – zipping up a no-hitter – to propel Amity to a 2-0 championship victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gleason was sharp, allowing just four hits and had a tremendous season, as the Rams ended the year at 22-3 and were 44-8 over the 2004 and 2005 seasons combined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the dish, Sarah Clavette worked well with Gleason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Championship Tilts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has played in five championship games in its history, going 1-4 over those contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lone victory came in 1985 when top-seeded Central defeated Windham (3-2) to capture the Class L title from Falcon Field in Meriden on June 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kim Corbin (seven Ks, no walks) threw a two-hitter to capture the win for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the bases loaded in the top of the third, Laura Fortier had the hit of the game as she drilled a two-RBI single to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central added a run in the sixth to secure a 3-0 push and held off the Whippets in the bottom of the seventh to propel the Rams to its only championship in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went 20-2 that season while Windham (20-1) lost for the first time (of note, Southington won the Class LL championship that day, defeating rival Cheshire 2-1 for its sixth title overall and the first of four straight).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1982, the Rams made it to the Class L finals but dropped a tough 3-2 decision to Lyman Hall and in 2001, No. 6 Central had its first state final contest against No. 12 Amity – dropping a heartbreaking 2-1 decision in 10 innings.</p>
