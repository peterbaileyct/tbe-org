<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – Which team is going to be the first one to knock off the boys track and field program over at Bristol Central?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are stacked this year and simply don’t have an equal in the CCC South.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Central was able to tally a huge win over Maloney, squaring away a 136-14 win from the BCHS track.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals are now 4-0 and outside of the 4x800 relay – the only event the Spartans were able to win – in was all Central from start to finish. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams from Bristol had solid showings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100, the grouping of Cassias Breland, Noah Conrod, Logan Jackson, and future UCONN footballer Victor Rosa won the event in 45.1 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And flipping over to the 4x400 relay, the combo of Cam Tomak, Jackson, Patrick Wininger, and Breland averaged sixty seconds a lap over the 4:00 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa ruled the 100 meters, finishing in 10.9 seconds, and in the javelin, his toss f 129 feet, seven inches was good for first place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Conrod dominated both the 200 (23.6 seconds) and 400 (53 seconds) meters while Frankie Porrini nabbed first place wins in the 800, 1600, and 3200-meters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini’s time of 2:05 won him the 800, he finished the 1600 in just 4:33 and in the 3200, the junior’s time of 10:45 could not be touched that afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jarrett Boxley had a day in both the 110 (16.7 seconds) and 330 (45.4 seconds) hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And more of that same winning treatment took place in the field as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treshawn Blair’s leap of 18 feet, 10.25 inches won him the long jump while basketball champion Aaron Brown took the triple jump (36 feet, nine inches)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the high jump, Central’s Anthony Paulino won the event with a successful make of five feet, two inches, Jude Browning’s make of eight feet, six inches won him the pole vault while Malachi Jones earned the victory in the shot put with a toss of 46 feet, 10 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Dan Lauretti took the discus with a throw of 121 feet, six inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Tuesday, Central will be challenged by Plainville from Tinty Track and Field in a CCC South engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
