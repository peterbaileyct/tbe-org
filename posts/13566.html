<p>MERIDEN - The last thing you want to do is sleep on the girls track and field squad from Bristol Central this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at the CCC South championships this past Tuesday from Platt High School in Meriden, the Rams made an incredible first place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Central and Maloney won the meet, each scoring 124 points to snare a share of the CCC South title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These girls continue to amaze me,” said Central coach Kiara Bonilla via Twitter. “Coming in and competing with the top of the conference and coming in first as a team with a tie to Maloney! We were only supposed to score 75 [points] but came out with 124! That’s grit.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of the city, Bristol Eastern placed seventh with 54 points.</p>

<p><strong>Central rules in the CCC South</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barnes won the high jump with a leap of five feet even while Craft (four feet, eight inches)&nbsp;was the runner up.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Barnes once again as she nabbed the league title with a leap of 16 feet, six-and-one-half inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Craft (15 feet, 11 inches) placed third in the long jump.</p>
