<p>BRISTOL – The race in the Class LL softball standings continues to be a close one because – in part – teams like Bristol Central simply refuse to lose.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have put together a tremendous winning streak, now at eight straight games, and is a sterling 15-2 overall with three huge showdowns left to go in the regular season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s the old adage, win the week,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “So we’ve already won the week. But we’re not satisfied.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been an incredible run to date but not a surprising one with the likes of pitching aces Alex Sciarretto and Sophia Torreso – two junior sensations – leading the squad over a tough six-pack of games this week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it’s leadoff hitter Kaley Laird belting a single to open the game, Sam or Leah Sklenka leading the charge in the outfield, or crafty Lorelei Stancavage tagging players out at the dish or collecting five RBI like she did against Wolcott, this squad is one of the top CCC programs the conference has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been like that over the entire campaign for the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proficient on both sides of the ball, Central’s two losses have been by one run – defeats at Plainville (3-2) to open the season and a 2-1 setback to Hall (April 28) that saw the Rams fall short by just one hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But since that point, it’s been all Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if the program was going to stumble sometime this season, this would have been the week to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it never happened over a string of tremendous wins.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with an 8-0 victory over Edwin O. Smith on Monday to Central’s stellar eight-run triumph over CCC South foe Middletown on Saturday, it was a clean sweep by the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That included a huge 6-1 victory over Wolcott on Thursday which was followed by an outstanding 3-2 triumph against CCC South foe Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had two games that were definitely postseason type games,” said Hayes. “I told the players to have energy and be ready to bring their ‘A’ game. And we did that [versus Wolcott]. It was a pretty solid performance.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that led a 15-2 ledger, fourth place overall in the Class LL standings and a real chance to catch the likes of Fairfield Ludlowe and Southington (both 15-1) ahead of Central in the CIAC standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Southington, Central takes its shot against the Knights on Wednesday in a prime time bout at 4:45 p.m. in Southington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights also have a couple pitching studs and a win by the Rams over Southington would vault the locals into third place in the Class LL race.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a huge game for both outstanding programs come Wednesday. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re just prepping for the [postseason] tournament,” said Hayes. “Every time we step on the field, we’re in a tournament mindset. We want to make the CCC Tournament like last year. So we have to take care of business.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The week that was for the Bristol Central softball program&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six games in six days is nightmarish for any scholastic program – no matter what the sport.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central’s softball program just simply smashed all the competition, outscoring opponents 50-4, despite not getting any rest or a chance for practice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the results from Central’s unofficial ‘Week of Doom’ which was, uniquely, all played from home at BCHS:&nbsp;</p>
