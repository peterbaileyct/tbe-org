<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have been babysitting for the 21-month-old for the second day while his mom preps for one of those certification tests that are habitually required for people in her profession.</p>

<p>Driving down Rt. 8 we will have noticed that most of the leaves have come down around our part of the state, but that that is not the case just a few miles away and certainly not closer to the Sound. This is something the 21-month-old informed us of from the car seat while we headed to a local park, where we were meeting his 23-month-old cousin and her dad, our No. 1 son.</p>

<p>“Look at all the leaves on the trees,” 21-month-old said, looking up through the glass roof of the vehicle we are driving in. “Up in the sky. All the leaves.” The cousins played together for a while on the playground stations, tried the slides, tried the swings, and stretched their short legs on a walk along one of the paths that we all shared with joggers, walkers, families—including one celebrating a <em>quinceañera</em>, and dogs and their owners.</p>

<p>Good times!</p>

<p>And at night for bedtime, Mary and I sat on the floor listening to the 21-month-old mimic his mom as she read favorite books and sometimes anticipating what would happen next.</p>

<p>And before that a long week at school, with Thanksgiving around the corner, and some students already heading out for a vacation with their families. We do live in interesting times, at least when it comes to school and routines. But, I have to admit, school never gets dull—there is always something happening (Last week was spirit week!) and then there are the students themselves, whom I never underestimate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, this week, I got talking to one—we were on a mask break—and we got chatting about his grandfather, who it turns out taught himself English in 7<sup>th</sup> grade. I had pulled out my decades old copy of Modern Rhetoric by Brooks and Warren to show them what kind of books students were learning from years ago. The student then caught up to me and said that book reminded him of the ones his grandfather had back in India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The student told me that when he was a child he used to open the cabinet doors with the books inside and just look at them. Then, he told me how his grandfather taught himself English, and how his writing was strong and purposeful. The grandfather spoke five languages fluently, and the student himself spoke four, but could only write in three. The class prior to this one the student and his classmates were extolling the virtues of good pens and writing paper. When they talked good pens, they included fountain pens and a brand of pen that is not available in United States but apparently makes for effortless and clean writing.</p>

<p>Never boring! Always something new to discover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of discovery, this week’s listening/reading is from a new blog called Press Run—I am certain I mentioned it in the past. The writers behind the blog are critics of the press and always present a new angle to how the media covers the news.

<p>And a last bit of information, of interest to our readers, our local state senator and one of our state representative are  holding an informational meeting in the Plymouth Town Hall this Tuesday a 6:30 p.m. to  discuss Covanta and its plans for burning medical waste.</p>

<p><em>“Come Sunday morning” is intended to be a weekly review, a recounting of the past week and an anticipation of week to come. Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism.
