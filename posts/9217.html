<p>Merely one day after being sworn in, Mayor Jeff Caggiano and the new city council presided over November’s council meeting very smoothly, relying on the experienced hand of Therese Pac, the City Clerk. When the mayor was unsure what the proper procedure was during the meeting, he turned to Ms. Pac, who knew exactly what was needed.</p>

<p>The opening ceremonies consisted of the new council members introducing themselves. Sebastian Panioto, Sue Tyler, Cheryl Thibeault, Andrew Howe, and Jacqueline Olsen attended the meeting in person, while Joleen Lusitani sat in via zoom. </p>

<p>The first item on the agenda was public participation, and when Laura Minor stepped up to the microphone, the new mayor and his council were reminded that they were now subject to public disapproval, as former Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu experienced so often.</p>

<p>Ms. Minor expressed her extreme disappointment at the choice of Liberty Baptist Church as the site of the previous night’s inauguration ceremony. She stated that she understood the rationale that many people did not want to wear a mask could be the reason for not using a public school auditorium for the ceremony, but said “the fact that the location was moved to a church which does not welcome as members our LGBTQ citizens, one… that has not participated….anywhere that interfaith services are accepted…” was very upsetting. Minor asked hypothetically what the reaction would be if another administration held the inauguration in a mosque or a temple.</p>

<p>She continued, “I hope that while you hold power in this office, you recognize that you have the power to decide who will be respected and how. I hope truly that this was an error of judgement and isn’t an indication of what we will see in the future.” She finished by saying, “I pray that you will truly be the elected officials for all the people of Bristol.”</p>

<p>In response to Laura Minor’s comments, Laura Vernaglia spoke in positive terms of the inauguration, saying that, as a gay married person, she attended the ceremony and did not feel uncomfortable or threatened at all. She went on to say that in multiple conversations with candidate Caggiano, she always felt respected and comfortable with his attitude toward all Bristolites.</p>

<p>Two notable appointments announced at the meeting were:</p>

<ol><li>The hiring of Richard Hart as the new chief of the Fire Department..</li><li>The appointment of Edward Krawiecki Jr. as the city’s Corporation Counsel.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several resolutions and contracts were voted on and passed without discussion or dissent. The lone exception was a proposal to approve the purchase and sale agreement between the city and Wheeler Clinic for Parcel 3 in Centre Square. Councilperson Thibeault requested the item be tabled until December’s meeting to give the members of the Council an opportunity to review the particulars. She stated that she had some hesitation in agreeing to a contract for such an important parcel with a non-profit, and whether such an agreement would place an undue burden on Bristol’s taxpayers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thibeault’s request was approved unanimously.</p>
