<p>The following actions are implemented while Connecticut’s extreme hot weather protocol is enacted:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection’s Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security uses its WebEOC communications network, which is an internet-based system that enables local, regional, and state emergency management officials and first responders to share up-to-date information about a variety of situations and conditions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Municipalities and other partners submit information on the opening of cooling centers into the WebEOC, providing a real-time database on the availability of these locations statewide. United Way 2-1-1 uses the system to act as a clearinghouse to assist residents in locating a cooling center.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Regional coordinators from the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security monitor WebEOC in order to respond to any requests from municipalities for state assistance.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The energy utility companies provide the state with regular updates regarding the impact of the weather conditions on their respective utilities throughout the duration of the protocol.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although anyone can suffer from heat-related illness, some people are at greater risk than others:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Infants and young children are sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and rely on others to regulate their environments and provide adequate liquids.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>People 65 years of age or older may not compensate for heat stress efficiently and are less likely to sense and respond to change in temperature.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>People who are overweight may be prone to heat sickness because of their tendency to retain more body heat.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>People who overexert during work or exercise may become dehydrated and susceptible to heat sickness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>People who are physically ill, especially those with heart disease or high blood pressure, or who take certain medications, such as for depression, insomnia, or poor circulation, may be affected by extreme heat.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some prevention tips to stay safe in extreme heat include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Keep your body temperature cool to avoid heat-related illness.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Stay in air-conditioned buildings as much as possible. If you must be outdoors, try to limit your outdoor activity to the morning and evening. Try to rest often in shady areas so that your body has a chance to cool off.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Find an air-conditioned shelter. (Call 2-1-1 for a list of cooling centers.) Do not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Avoid direct sunlight.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take cool showers or baths.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Check on those most at-risk several times a day.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Pets that cannot be brought indoors should be provided ready access to water and shade to keep them cool.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Never leave pets inside of parked vehicles because temperatures can soar to life-threatening levels within minutes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
