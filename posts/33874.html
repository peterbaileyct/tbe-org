<p>The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team is finally hitting the turf and takes on Plainville on the road tonight at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the debut match for both programs from the CCC South.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, looking to rebound from a tough 1-12-3 campaign from last year, know that there’s opportunity this season and nowhere to go but up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has returning talent - some that played through a rough 2022 but gained invaluable experience along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior captain Emma Stavens should have a big year as she helps lead the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South is loaded once again and here’s who to look for and what to expect from the Kingstreeters this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern Girls Soccer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach:&nbsp;</strong>Scott Redman</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record:&nbsp;</strong>1-12-3</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Emma Stavens, senior captain&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Megan Krok, senior captain</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Maggie Kozikowski, junior&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Shannon Philippon, soph&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Kate Patterson, soph&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Alaina Joy, frosh&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Maria Perrone, junior</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grouping is one the longtime coach will be employing offensively this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s still some mixing and matching to do position-wise but things will sort themselves out in short order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It’s a] core that has some experience,” said Redman. “Learning to play together and in different spots will be critical. I’m still figuring out where they’ll play but they will see significant time in the middle of the field.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the backline will be led by junior keeper Hailey Beebe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at the remainder of Eastern’s roster:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Hailey Beebe, junior GK</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Gabby Piendak, junior defender&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Corinne Sutula, soph defender&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Mya McCallop, senior midfielder</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Selina Kielb, senior&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Cara Lusitani, frosh defender/midfielder&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy, who tore her ACL, will not be playing this year but Beebe is up to the challenge in the goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every game in the CCC is going to be a dogfight and girls soccer won’t be any different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman is hoping his squad can pull out a postseason berth, but everyone has to be on the same page to accomplish that lofty goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With a softer tier schedule, the tournament isn’t out of the question, but it will take some dedication and commitment from all players,” said Redman.&nbsp;</p>
