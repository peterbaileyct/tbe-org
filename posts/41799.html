<p>Bristol Eastern knew they had their work cut out for them when they faced Windsor Saturday night. The Warriors were the #2 seed in the CCC tournament, and just a short time earlier had defeated #1 seed East Catholic. The scouting report probably read, Windsor is too good, too quick, too big, shoots too well, and plays great defense as well.</p>

<p>The scouts didn’t lie. The Lancers ran into a buzzsaw and never really were in the game. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor jumped out ahead 8-0 in the first two minutes before a hoop by Brady Bell at the 5:40 mark gave BE their first points.&nbsp; Windsor then went on to outscore the Lancers, 25-11 in the quarter, highlighted by three three's in a row by the Warriors’ Kaiden James late in the period.</p>

<p>Windsor then kept the pedal to the floor, outscoring Eastern 25-8 in the second quarter to take a commanding 50-19 lead at the half.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor shot 62% in the first half (21 of 34 from the floor), including 5 for 11 on three's (Windsor connected on 12 three's for the game).</p>

<p>Windsor kept it up in the third period, outscoring Eastern by a 25-16 count and leading by 40 points going into the final stanza.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had their best output in the fourth quarter, outscoring Windsor 24-10, but the final outcome was never in doubt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brayden Dauphinais led the Lancers with 21 points for BE, 19 in the second half.&nbsp; Zaveyn Tate also played a strong game, scoring 13.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
