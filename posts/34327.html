<p>Two incidents on the same day, happening on opposite sides of the city, brought attention back to the city’s response to racism and white supremacy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“While we don’t know who was to blame for the recent destruction of property that was tainted with racial slurs and symbols, what I do know is this community deserves better from our leader,” said Scott Rosado, Democratic mayoral candidate who will face incumbent Republican Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano in November.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, a post appeared on Facebook with a photo of the racial slur written in chalk across a sidewalk in the parking area at Rockwell Park. Later in the day, two swastikas appeared on street signs around Northeast Middle School, according to a report from the Bristol Police Dept. announcing the crimes and seeking assistance from residents to help identify suspects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor posted on the Mayor’s Office Facebook page the following: “As recently stated at our last City Council Meeting, ‘there is no room for hate in the City of Bristol.’” He asked residents to be vigilant and to report any questionable behavior to the Bristol Police Dept.&nbsp;He included the official police statement with his statement.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A stance against racism and white supremacy clearly tells your constituents where you stand, and we can’t get that from him (the mayor),” said District 2 Democratic challenger Morris “Rippy” Patton.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now we are left to wonder ‘why’ we have the uptick in racist activity and a mayor that refuses to condemn it at the same time.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past year and a half there have been three incidents involving racist and white supremacist activities in Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In mid-June, 2022, white supremacist leaflets with dropped on lawns in a northeast neighborhood. Earlier this summer in late June and early July, signs promoting white supremacism appeared on telephone poles Farmington Avenue.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A small group of white supremacists rallied on the corner of Todd Street and Pine Street in late August. The participants wore masks and held up a sign reading, “Keep CT White.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout, when pressed, the mayor has condemned this activity but has refused to use the terms racism or white supremacy, referring rather to hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“These do not represent the majority of Bristol, the All-Heart City. Bristol can and will do better, and it starts with leadership,” said DTC chair Ken Rasmussen-Tuller.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TBE reached out to both Republican incumbents and their Democratic opponents through the town committee chairs, respectively, for comments on the latest developments. TBE reached out to the mayor directly. He did not respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Republican incumbent in District 1 Sebastian Panioto, said he agreed with the mayor in saying there is no room for hate in Bristol. Panioto added, "whether it’s racism or anti-Semitism or otherwise." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We don’t know who did it at this point but it’s disgusting and it’s not who we are as a city,” he said. “We’re better than this.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sue Tyler, Republican incumbent in District 2, said on her Facebook page, “We do not condone hate, racism, bigotry, bullying, intimidation, verbal and/or physical violence, vandalism and the destruction of property or any kind of behavior that is alarming and a nuisance to our community.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local Democrats held a press conference on Aug. 21 addressing the mayor’s response to racist and white supremacist activity in the city. At the same time, they revealed posts from the personal Facebook page of the then-manager of the Bristol Farmers Market. The posts contained racist, vile language. The manager has since resigned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller, Democratic candidate for the District 1, said, “I am troubled to learn of the swastika symbol found outside of a Bristol public school yesterday, and as a father, this troubles me deeply.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark Dickau, Democratic candidate for a District 3 seat, said, “I stand in solidarity with Jewish people, people of color and all marginalized people targeted by such graffiti. This needs to be taken seriously and is a very urgent matter, that can’t be handled lightly.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Liza Salgado, Democratic candidate for District 2, said, “I am deeply disappointed by our mayor and current city council members for their lack of action for condemning racism.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maria Simmons, a Democrat candidate for the Board of Education, said, school and elected leaders must take&nbsp;action. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The entire community would be best served knowing how they will respond to the explicit acts of racism and antisemitism found in our community and schools," she said. "If Bristol is truly 'All Heart,' and we are 'Better Together,' we must see it to believe it."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A statement from the Bristol Public Schools posted to parentssquare.com, the communication venue for the Board of Education, notified parents of the vandalism that included the swastika, and assured the parents that the public school system is taking the situation seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parents with questions or concerns, are asked to contact Principal Dan Sonstrom.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a statement released on Tuesday morning, the Bristol Police Department said it is investigating the incidents. They are asking for the public’s assistance in identifying suspects, including providing reviewing cameras in the area for suspicious activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
