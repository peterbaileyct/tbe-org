<p>The final twelve Thanksgiving Day football games between Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern have been decided by several split decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that stretch, the Lancers won its first five games over Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon after, in 2015, the first Central win of the decade led to seven straight victories - a streak that continues to this very day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It started with Eastern’s Dylan Ouellette running for 200 yards in the 2010 classic but by the start of the 2020s, Central’s Victor Rosa and Tre Blair changed those fortunes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams only won two of those seven games via blowout as five of those contests since 2015 were decided by one possession or less.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the year before the pandemic, there was even an overtime game between the programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To conclude this series, let’s take a look at the final 12 games between BC/BE, starting with Eastern’s shutout victory in 2010:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Rosa ended the day with 31 rushes for 171 yards and five touchdowns – tied for the most TDs scored in a Thanksgiving Day game along with Washington (2000). Eastern’s Elijah Gagliardo made a Thanksgiving Day-tying eight receptions while Alex Marshall had 37 carries for 159 yards.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
