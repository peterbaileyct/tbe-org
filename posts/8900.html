<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you have done well that justifies your reelection? What are you specifically going to do to ensure that&nbsp;progress continues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The decent and hardworking people of Bristol deserve responsive representation and that has been my focus while serving on the Council. Early in the pandemic I exemplified this by working with the mayor’s office and the Bristol-Burlington Health District to both deliver PPE to small businesses and keep the public safe and informed.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Numerous projects have recently been completed and many others are commencing soon. Twenty new businesses have opened during the pandemic and downtown is percolating with planned projects as all but one Centre Square lot has been sold. Ground will soon be broken on a $25+ million assisted living facility on North Main. The Wheeler Clinic’s headquarters are moving to Centre Square, bringing over 100 jobs to downtown. A 90-unit apartment building with ground floor commercial use is being constructed across from City Hall. A multi-tiered municipal parking garage is being built behind the police station. The Memorial Boulevard Magnet School and Rockwell Theater project is ahead of schedule, below budget, and will bring a vibrant artistic and economic boost to downtown. Lastly, on Middle Street all parcels in Industrial Park are under contract and a&nbsp;$30+ million event center is under construction by the Hilton Doubletree.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In closing, I&nbsp;would like to commend the creation of the American Rescue Fund Task Force, an all-star committee established by the mayor and unanimously approved by the Council. This bipartisan task force is comprised of fifteen members: seven Republicans, six Democrats, and two independents. The group has begun and will continue to make transformative decisions regarding how $28 million in federal funds will be used to support Bristol for years to come. Continue to watch for the dynamic changes these funds will usher with the guidance of some of our city's most keen, intuitive, and financially astute people.</strong></p>

<p>2.     What work have you done to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol?  Is there more that needs to be done?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I treat all people with respect and dignity regardless of their race, religion, or sexual orientation. I believe that our actions and the ways we treat all people defines our character. I am fortunate to have been surrounded by a diverse circle of friends and associates that have enriched my life by exposing me to different cultures and orientations. These associations have made me more rounded and culturally conscious. I have attended workshops and community conversations regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion in town and I believe it is vital for our community to continue exploring how Bristol can continue striving to be an inclusive and open community to all.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are taxes in Bristol too high or fair as they are? If you think taxes are too high, what specific cuts would you recommend to bring them down and how would you deal with the impact on services and programs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol taxes are not too high when compared to similarly sized towns in Connecticut. We need to continue our unprecedented economic development to prevent taxes from increasing, and hopefully decrease rates for homeowners. Based on the track record of the Zoppo-Sassu administration and the City Council over the past four years, I believe the latter is achievable. The City of Bristol has experienced its biggest grand list growth in over 12 years. It is imperative that we continue moving in this direction while monitoring budgeted expenditures to ensure that city services are being delivered efficiently.</strong><br></p>

<p><strong>As a retired teacher, I know how important a quality educational system is and how it ties back to our property values. Teaching high school at Pomperaug Regional High School in Middlebury/ Southbury for 38 years, I would bring a skill set that would transition and benefit the Bristol public school system and its residents. Bristol, like every town, needs to continue to progress and remain competitive in the 21st-century with its schools and students. An exemplary educational school district is the backbone of any successful community.</strong></p>

I was a teacher, a dean and a head coach for several sports at Pomperaug High School for 38 years. I am a member of Saint Francis DeSales parish in Bristol.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think the Democrat City Council has done that justifies their election? What are you specifically going to do to ensure that&nbsp;progress continues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This is my first opportunity running for Bristol City Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lived in Bristol for almost 50 years and have developed an understanding and awareness of where Bristol has been and where it is heading presently in its economic development.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I have a network of friends and business associates that are keenly interested in Bristol’s economic development. I will use that network and my experience in manufacturing and education to assist our city administration and leaders achieve their economic goals and see that Bristol remains a vibrant, competitive city.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I will always have an open door policy where I will listen and bring with me honesty, integrity, and great character to the Bristol councilman’s position and ultimately to the residents of Bristol. Bristol residents can be confident I will support them and help provide resources to allow them to prosper and be successful in our great city of Bristol.</strong></p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What work have you done to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in Bristol?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there more that needs to be done?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><li><strong>&nbsp;As a teacher school Dean, and head coach at my high school, I truly understood the importance, relevance, and necessity to instill certain values into my students that I taught and athletes that I coached.Treating all people with respect and dignity was a constant in our school community!</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol has developed a council that addresses diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Bristol community. The purpose is to engage with the Bristol community and city departments to create awareness, access and opportunities that will support an inclusive environment for all Bristol residents and Bristol and business owners. This council gives the residents and business owners of Bristol a chance to connect and voice their concerns and personal experiences.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The council also coordinates with city departments and staff on justice, equity, diversity and inclusion best practices. When making decisions, they must identify inequities in city policies and procedures and coordinate with city leaders to dismantle systematic barriers, create opportunities for cultural awareness, and bring the community together together to celebrate diversity.</strong></p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are taxes in Bristol too high or fair as they are? If you think taxes are too high, what specific cuts would you recommend to bring them down and how would you deal with the impact on services and programs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><li><strong>As a fiscal conservative I want to know where my tax dollars are going. Nobody likes to pay taxes! Nobody will say taxes are too low! People want to know their politicians are fiscally responsible and smart and where their hard earned dollars are being spent.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>There is a zero tax increase for the city of Bristol this year. That’s a great statement for the taxpayers of Bristol. As somebody who is a fiscal conservative whose life experiences afforded me the ability to look at financial questions carefully, I will make sure we make smart business decisions and always keep the balance between making sure the city advances but always keep the taxpayers in mind.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I am pleased to hear there are numerous economic development projects in place to help the taxpayers of Bristol reside in a cohesive, vibrant, and pedestrian friendly community. Taxpayers will benefit from this economic development and continue its vision into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century led by our mayor Ellen and her outstanding town council. I hope to be elected to the Bristol City Council on November 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;and hope I can count on your support and vote.&nbsp;</strong><br></p>
