<p>NEW HAVEN – Are you ready for the CIAC boys Division II Championship game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the crew over at Bristol Central sure is and as of Wednesday night, the time and date for the championship tilt against No. 2 Northwest Catholic has been revealed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the title bout, the most anticipated championship showdown in the state of Connecticut winter, will be the final event from the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville on Saturday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Division II boys championship has been slated for March 19 at 8:15 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a long day of scholastic basketball play, was there any other way to cap off night one from Uncasville?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central enters the showdown with a perfect 27-0 ledger while the Lions (25-2) aren’t far off that mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest’s two losses this season have come against Wilbur Cross (72-68) on December 18 and against Central (63-56) in the title game of the Central Connecticut Conference finals back on March 3 (63-56).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, this championship showdown is a no-miss event and hopefully, the city of Bristol makes its presence known in Uncasville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll focus a little more on what Central should expect against Northwest over the next couple days in The Bristol Edition.</p>

<h3><strong>This Weekend’s Big Games…</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Central/Northwest contest is slated as the main event on Saturday, the final game of the tournament on Sunday will feature the boys Division I title bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some way, somehow, East Catholic is back in the championship fray after a grueling regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 8 East Catholic takes its shot at No. 2 Notre Dame-West Haven in what should be a very good game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other boys title bouts in boys play, top-rated Kolbe Cathedral is in the finals in Division III, taking on third ranked Daniel Hand at 3 p.m. on Saturday and in Division IV, it’s a bit of a surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 4 Granby and No. 6 Bloomfield made it to the championship round (Sunday, 12:30 p.m.) and Sports and Medical Sciences Academy (ranked second) is in its first ever title showdown and drew No. 8 Windham in what should be a competitive title contest in Division V.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Division V showdown will be the first title game played in Uncasville on Saturday, starting at 10 a.m.</p>
