<p>BRISTOL - The first game for the Bristol Blues in the 2022 New England Collegiate Baseball League playoffs did not go according to plan against a very good program from Marthas Vineyard on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues, earning a bye into semifinal round action, led 2-0 though three innings before allowing nine straight runs, falling by a 10-3 final to the Sharks from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the best-of-three series and the Blues must win two straight games, including its second contest tonight on the road at the Shark Tank, in order to earn a spot in the NECBL finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol starter Jagger Duquette threw the ball well for the locals, allowing just one hit over 3.2 innings of work.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He gave up one earn run and two walks while fanning four over his no decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Smith (two hits, two earned runs) lost the game in relief for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sharks’ starter Case Matter was excellent in his four frames of work, posting ten strikeouts, walking three, and allowing just two hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also did not factor into the decision but J.D. McCracken did, winning the showdown in middle relief (3 IP, 0 ER, 6 Ks).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was outhit 10-8 but Joseph Rios was able to go 1-for-3 with a walk and two RBI to lead the Blues at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marthas Vineyard pitching racked up 17 strikeouts that night but had to battle from the plate to eventually steal the game away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Smith started the first inning for the Blues with a single while Derek Tenney and Griffin Arnone both walked to load the bases with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Rios dropped in a single - scoring two - as the Blues snared an immediate 2-0 push from through one completed stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the locals got into trouble in the top of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol made three pitching substitutions over the fourth inning as the Sharks took control of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors tied the game at 2-2 early in the fourth and after Marthas Vineyard loaded the bases, Bristol’s Jackson Vanesko subbed in for Thomas Benincaso with Logan Chambers up to bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chambers ended up slapping the ball out of the park as his grand slam made it a 6-2 contest with the Sharks on top.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marthas scored three more times in the fifth to secure an imposing 9-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down by seven runs entering the final frame, a sacrifice fly from Bristol’s Jack Lynch scored Zach Stephenson to trim the deficit to 10-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Blues ended up stranding 12 runners by the end of the game, falling by seven runs over its first semifinal contest of 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
