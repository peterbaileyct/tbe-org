<p>Sunday morning around 9 a.m. (Sammy!), the GMB staff came into contact with this heap of a mess in Forestville on East Main Street near the Plainville town line.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On this date, 1970</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democratic Town Committee held a meeting at the American Legion Hall on Hooker Court. The purpose of the meeting was to plan a primary campaign for the endorsed candidate for the U.S. Senate, Al Donahue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry Hershman, the town committee chairman, said, “Al Donahue presents a fresh new face in politics. He presents himself for what he is, a concerned successful businessman.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donahue lost in a primary to Joseph Duffey, who lost to Lowell Weicker who lost to Joe Lieberman, who retired in 2012 because no one liked him. Okay, that is not true, but it certainly seemed that way. &nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Movie review: 'Oppenheimer'</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Bristol does not have a movie theatre, the GMB staff ventured to Plainville (gasp!) to see "Oppenheimer." Is it a masterpiece as it has been portrayed? Tough call, only time will tell. However, it is good, damn good, and worth another watch. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How about them apples?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That does it for today. Be skeptical, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
