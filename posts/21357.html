<p>Patricia (Frechette) Santilli, 87 of Bristol, widow of Oswald “Ozzie” Santilli, died peacefully on Monday, Dec. 26. She was comforted at the hour of her death by prayers of her deep Catholic faith offered aloud by her children and grandchildren and her nephew Father Rick Frechette on the phone from Haiti.  </p>

<p>Pat was born May 28, 1935, in Hartford, one of five children of the late Leo and Hazel (Bartlett) Frechette. She graduated from Hartford Public High School where she met Ozzie who held her hand on that first date and never let go until his death after 57 cherished years of marriage. After living in Alaska while Ozzie was in the Army, they returned to Hartford and eventually moved to Bristol where they raised five children.</p>

<p>Although Pat was employed by SNET, Cigna, several local Banks and even worked at St. Paul High School to help pay the tuition in the 1970s, she mainly excelled at being a wife, mom and grandmother, cooking Sunday pasta for weekly family gatherings.  Her children’s friends were regarded as family and were made to feel that our home was theirs as well. </p>

<p>She remained close to many dear friends, near and far, as well as several neighbors from Ivy Drive where life was sweet and precious. She amassed a lifetime of memories vacationing and day-tripping with her brother Tom, his wife Pat and their 11 children combined.</p>

<p>Pat leaves behind twin sons-James Santilli, John Santilli and his wife Kim; two daughters Cyndy Valentine and her husband Richard, Beth Lincoln and her husband Robert; She also leaves her five grandchildren who could never get enough of her right to the very end of her life holding her hand and kissing her face during her final days--Jim Santilli, Rachel (Keith) Beaulieu, David Kendall and fiancé Samira Mostofi, Melissa (Joe) Lincoln-Fortier and Jared Lincoln. All of whom highly regarded her life as a model to “love” by. Additionally, she was Gigi to four great-granddaughters Aubrey, Brynn, and twins Juliana and Olivia. </p>

<p>She leaves her brother Tom whose relationship grew deeper with each passing year and was a treasure for all of her life.  With indescribable grief, she was pre-deceased by her son Bruce in 2010 as well as brothers Leo, Richard and Ken. Throughout all of her life, she smiled and laughed easily during sunny days and handled life’s most challenging hardships with grace and strength. She was always aware of fleeting time. She was a sweet, beautiful soul.  </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
