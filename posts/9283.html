<p>The following is a news release from the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Department:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City of Bristol Department of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services (BPRYCS) is excited to continue their Annual Holiday Gift Giving program. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an effort to support as many families as possible, BPRYCS is seeking individuals, families, organizations, businesses, and community members to sponsor a youth or family. Participating community members and sponsors will receive a youth/family profile with the Bristol youth’s clothing size and 3-4 items of interests that can assist with gift suggestions.<br></p>

<p>The Holiday Gift Giving program is crucial in supporting the critical local connections that the Youth and Community Services division works to build and strengthen year round. Last year, BPRYCS proudly supported over 325 Bristol youth. The program also serves as a great project for families, office groups, organizations, clubs, and schools.<br><br>Kyana Anderson, a Youth and Family Coordinator with the Youth and Community Services division, expressed her gratitude and excitement for the program’s return, "We’re already seeing a higher number of local youth and families looking for support than previous years so I’m excited to be offering this program again. I’ve been coordinating this program for three years now and it’s always amazing to see the community come together during the holiday season. Our sponsors and donors make this program happen and I'm constantly impressed by their eagerness to give." Anderson continued by noting, “We had 34 sponsors in 2019 and almost doubled that to 66 sponsors in 2020. Our goal this year is to have at least 100 sponsors.”<br></p>

<p>The program is thankful for the many generous sponsors and donors that have generously donated their time and resources to help to raise monetary contributions, toys, clothing, and program awareness in the past.<br>“In 2020 our department serviced over 150 families and we expect to see the number of need increase again this year. Our Youth and Community Services team is committed to working with our generous community partners to ensure every child is taken care of this holiday season” remarked. Joshua Medeiros, Superintendent of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services.<br></p>
