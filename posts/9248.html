<p>Established five years ago, the Men &amp; Boys’ Fund seeks to&nbsp;help&nbsp;men and boys improve the quality of their lives, increase self-sufficiency&nbsp;and&nbsp;make&nbsp;a positive&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;their communities.&nbsp;In the fall each year, the Fund provides grants to programs that align with the Fund’s mission. In addition, throughout the year, the Men &amp; Boys’ Immediate Response Fund supports grants of up to $250 for men and boys who may be in need of immediate assistance due to a particular life situation or unexpected financial hardship.&nbsp;</p>
