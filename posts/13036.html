<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – Maybe the Bristol Central baseball team has finally found its stride after a bit of tomfoolery early in the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that uplifting play seems to be just in time for the Rams to make their playoff run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After absorbing a tough 2-7 start, which included two three-game losing streaks and more headaches than a usual program should endure over a full season, Central has made a little run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program has rebounded nicely with three straights wins while not allowing the opposition any runs on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That stretch has put the locals back in the state tournament hunt as the program rebounded nicely off a grueling stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the team isn’t satisfied in the least – even off this slick winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m just going to try to keep playing,” said Central coach Bunty Ray. “We’ve had some things happen with injuries and some other things over the course of the season. We’re just trying to play our best baseball.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And we still even haven’t done that yet.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After losing at home to Platt by a 7-1 final on Wednesday, April 27, Central has been a tough out ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams defeated Plainville 6-0 last Saturday, the program’s first of three straight shutouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Oscar Kuzinar, one of the squad’s sophomore sensations, pitched the shutout for the Rams that day and repeated the feat several days later in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Golden Hurricanes, Central’s offense sprang to life as the team scored a 10-0 win on Thursday – earning Kuzinar another shoutout victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzinar, gaining all sorts of confidence, threw a one hitter that included four strikeouts and minimal baserunners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a huge back-to-back showing by Kuzinar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve got a tough schedule ahead of us,” said Ray. “It’s the next man up scenario. Oscar’s got to give us another performance [along with] Jake Voisine, and Nick Krompegal. It just can’t be a couple pitchers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[But] our pitchers have been our strength.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That includes sophomore stud Nate Pirog who has won two games already this season and is certainly coming around – helping to fuel the defense as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams made minimal mistakes against Plainville, Bristol Eastern, and New Britain – each performance leading to something bigger and better in the following game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s infield has the likes of Christian Stafford, JT Clark, Frankie Spirito, Mike Allen and catcher Ryan Ring all playing extremely well right now as Central is looking to make a splash past the midseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our defense is getting better,” said Ray. “You can see it. We’re starting to play with that little bit of passion you need.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the offense sprang to life, nearly notching 10 hits against the Hurricanes, as the locals have outscored the competition 17-0 over its last three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Included in that three-game winning steak was a 1-0 triumph against crosstown rival Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central tallied five hits against the Lancers, getting two from Frank Spirito, and then the junior shutout the Lancers the rest of the way over his relief appearance on the mound (two hits, six Ks) from beautiful Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m going to be happy with the win [over Eastern] but there’s a lot of things we’re going to have to clean up in order to make the tournament,” said Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting a healthy Clark back has been a big deal and this team needs his veteran presence, leadership, and playing abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is still a bit on the youthful side with freshman Aiden Lopez and sophomore Anthony Santilli manning key positions on the field along with junior shortstop Mike Allan and centerfielder Zach Vanasse.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting this program additional reps at the plate will be critical to the team’s success over the rest of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three games before Central’s offensive explosion, and the ensuing three-game winning streak, saw the Rams post just 12 runs over its previous five contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems as if the offense and defense are starting to gel just a bit as Central is looking to make its regular season run this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Offensively, I know it’s a work-in-progress but some guys were out of sorts today,” said Ray of the Eastern game. “It’s a very emotional game so guys are maybe a bit anxious. It’s a very young team out there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But I’m looking forward to see what these guys can do down the stretch.”</p>
