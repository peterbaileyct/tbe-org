<p>World War II veteran, Joe Caminiti is doing well after surgery to repair a broken hip that he sustained in a fall earlier this week, reports by American Legion historian, Neal Supranovich, who spoke with permission from Caminiti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caminiti, who is 99-years-old, will be honored at the annual Bristol Elks Flag Day event tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. at the lodge on South Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caminiti, who was awake during the operation on Wednesday, which involved inserting a plate and screws, said he watched the procedure, listened to the doctor explain what was happening, and never felt a thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was walking the same day and was scheduled to return home on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that if he feels good Saturday night he will be at the Flag Day event, which he looks forward to as he hopes to see friends there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Caminiti thanked those who called him after hearing about the fall, including the mayor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caminiti's fall follows a similar incident by his wife, who fell a few weeks ago and broke her pelvis. She was recuperating in a nursing home and returned home on Thursday, according to Supranovich.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two have been married 77 years--a marriage that has been blessed by the pope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well-wishers can send cards in his name to American Legion Post 2, 22 Hooker Ct., Bristol, CT 06010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Correction: The original article stated that Caminiti is 100-years old. He will turn 100 years old in October.</em></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
