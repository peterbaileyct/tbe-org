<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to Tuesday. However, please be advised: watch your step, stay off the grass and do not enter. Pardon our appearance, beware of the dog and, caution, wet floor. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely today. In fact, this afternoon, there could be strong thunderstorms.</p>

<p>Tonight, Bristolâ€™s klieg lights will be on the city council meeting. For no reason other than it is a city council meeting, and you never know what will happen.</p>

<p>Attention sky watchers: Venus will be visible (if the weather cooperates) in the predawn sky of Wednesday Sept. 14. It will appear quite close to the sliver of what will be a crescent moon.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
