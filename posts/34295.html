<p>“As a Bristolite, it has been frightening in the past few months to hear about White supremacists' flyers, signs and banners appearing in my city, in addition to those despicable events, homophobic graffitii and a message with the 'n' word and now a swastika have been found.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are the words of Laura Slesinger Minor in reaction to the latest display of racism and hate in the city.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, Sept.18, swastikas were discovered spray painted on a "No Smoking" sign located by the Felice Road entrance to Northeast Middle School and a stop sign located at Deer Park and Shagbark roads. The antisemitic symbols&nbsp;were found during the holiest week in the Jewish year. On that same day, a racial slur written in chalk along the sidewalk appeared in Rockwell Park. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to these indictments and&nbsp;other recent instances of racist propaganda, Bristol residents have had their fill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joseph Grieco, president of the board of directors at the Church of Enteral Light, told the TBE that this is another sad day that has befallen the city of Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“It is never something to be taken lightly nor swept under,” he said. “Those who spread and embrace these hateful ideologies must be informed that their radical beliefs are not welcome here.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because she has been on the front lines of this issue by organizing rallies, the TBE reached out to Melina Floyd-Torres. Floyd-Torres puts the blame at the feet of the city’s leaders. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We can all see this is a direct result of the inactive and inadequate leadership that enables anyone who does these cowardly hateful acts around our city.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Antar, who has been active&nbsp;in the community through the Bristol Anti-Racism Brigade, stated that there is a national surge in white supremacy, and that our&nbsp;administration must take action. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Other municipalities throughout the nation have been able to make economic and education programs to address these problems,” said Antar. “It’s time we become national leaders in creating solutions, rather than retrospectively dealing with the fallout. Working people of all colors are tired of having to pick up the pieces.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antar's father, Ali, also weighed in on the discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He wrote in an email, "It is very shocking to hear this. These activities in Bristol must be condemned."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The elder Antar, who is a physics professor at Central Connecticut University, added, "We have to speak out with one voice condemning this as a coalition."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said community leaders, especially elected ones, should not shy away from taking a stand against racims and white supremacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol's Interfaith Coalition, which is comprised of multiple faiths and backgrounds, released a statement in which it stated that it was appalled and saddened to hear of the latest "manifestations of hate" in the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They stated that they stand in solidarity with Bristol's residents and other in the country as a whole against hatred and bigotry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It is imperative that we and other leaders, as well as every resident of Bristol do not remain silent in the face of incidents like these, lest they continue to grow," the coalition statement reads. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the perpetrators of the latest incidents are unknown, Minor said she feels that&nbsp;minority&nbsp;groups in Bristol have been marginalized in&nbsp;recent&nbsp;years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“From the 2021 inauguration being held in a Christian church which doesn’t accept gay congregants, to an ordinance that stopped the Pride flag from being flown on City properties and no Pride Month recognized by the city," she said, "to a lack of attendance or a message on the interfaith National Day of Prayer event, to a lack of a mayoral/City Council message for Hispanic Heritage month, we have not seen the inclusive, proactive and supportive messages that would help to discourage these kinds of acts.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These most recent acts, especially one involving a swastika, Minor pointed out, occur during the holiest days in the year for Jews--the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"To hear of of a swastika painted where children could see it at a Bristol school tears at my heart," she said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"How can we teach about Americans fighting wars against Nazis and other who hate those who are different from them and then have our children see those signs of hate here in our city?"</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
