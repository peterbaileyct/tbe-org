<p>It is with deep sorrow and much love that we announce the passing of Al Simmons, 75, of Marathon, Fla.&nbsp;Al died unexpectedly on Sunday, Nov. 6, at the finish line of the IronMan competition in Panama City, Fla.</p>

<p>Born Oct. 25, 1947, in New Haven, Conn., Allen was the son of Alvin and Lucile (McPherson) Simmons.&nbsp;Raised in Southington, Conn., Al received his Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of New Haven.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Al founded Mustang Motorcycle Products in Terryville and built it into the largest aftermarket motorcycle seat manufacturing company in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From an early age, Al lived life to the fullest in every sense. Starting as a young boy, his first and true love was aviation, earning his pilot’s license as a teenager.&nbsp;Over the next decades he continued achieving by earning his instrument rating, his multi-engine rating for both land and sea, his seaplane rating for both single and multiengine, his glider rating, B-25 second in command rating, and had recently begun helicopter lessons.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Al was highly intelligent and inquisitive, with insatiable curiosity; he never turned down a trip to a museum!&nbsp;With a passion for travel, Al was always excited to share pictures and talk about what he had learned on his latest adventures to more than 75 countries around the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was indomitable, always demanding extraordinary physical discipline from himself.&nbsp;No challenge was too difficult for him to take on and he enjoyed a variety of activities including SCUBA diving, fishing, snowboarding and kiteboarding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting with motorcycling events in his teens, he later competed and excelled in windsurfing, stand-up paddleboarding, glider soaring, marathons, and triathlons, ending at the finish line of the Panama City, Fla., IronMan on Nov. 6.&nbsp;Al left us the way he lived life, crossing the finish line.</p>
