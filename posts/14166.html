<p>SIMSBURY - After a tough 5-3 setback to Meriden the previous day, the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team scooped up a big 11-7 victory over Simsbury from Memorial Park on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 improved to 3-2 overall and 2-2 in Zone 1 action as Bristol won its first road game of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a good bounce-back after last night” against Meriden said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of the Simsbury win. “[Against Meriden], we didn’t play well and had a couple tough hits right at people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol drilled the ball all over the field against Simsbury, scoring four runs in the second inning, three in the fourth and another four in the fifth to make it an 11-2 game - cruising to the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To come out here and put up 11 runs, I thought we did a really good job with guys in scoring position,” said LaPenta. "We put the ball in play and got some big hits when we needed it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of cruising, Roberto Cruz moved to 2-0 on the season, throwing into the seventh against an aggressive Simsbury attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz allowed seven runs on nine hits but did enough to keep Simsbury at bay until running out of pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Roberto did a good job,” said LaPenta. “He did not have his good stuff today. He did not have command, he was up a lot on his breaking ball, but I told him that’s what pitchers do and you’re not always going to have your best stuff when you pitch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He battled through it and got the win and I was pleased with that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Churchill mopped up in the seventh, picking up a strikeout to end the contest before Post 84 could get the tying runner to the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jayden came in and threw strikes,” said LaPenta of Churchill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury had a busy first inning as the first three batters reached base, producing a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jacob Williams singled on, stole second and came home when JJ Fagnant slipped a base hit by first base as the lead runner scored to make it 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Stickles walked with one away and Tyler Martin was then hit by a pitch to put two on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Woodsome grounded out to third but the ball was bungled as all three runners were safe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chris Osuch then tagged a double down the line in left, plating two, giving Bristol the lead for good at 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as Woodsome was sliding into third base, he appeared to be interfered with, and hurt his troublesome shoulder as he attempted to slide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Woody popped out his shoulder again,” said LaPenta though Woodsome managed to pop it back into place as the M.A.S.H. units flying over field during game play were not required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Beaucar ended up pinch-running for Woodsome at third and with two on, Elliot Norris grounded out to shortstop but the throw home did not get Beaucar as Post 2 scooped up a 3-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Churchill unleashed a fly ball to center for the second out but Osuch sprinted home to score as the sacrifice fly gave Bristol a fourth run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing 4-1 in the bottom of the second, Simsbury’s Matt Fagnant walked, Drew Anastasio singled to left-center, and Jacob Cohen went to first on a base-on-balls - loading things up with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owen Murphy later sent a ball to Beaucar in right for an out but Matt Fagnant was off from third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beaucar’s throw in was nearly on the money to the plate and Osuch’s tag looked good but Murphy was called safe - chopping the deficit to 4-2 through two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a quiet third, Norris tallied his first hit in the fourth, a single up the middle, then stole second, and Churchill advanced him to third on his groundout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Adam Caron slapped an RBI single into right, making it a 5-2 game in Bristol’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Fradette joined the hit parade with a single to left and with two away, Bristol had runners on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta then went for the ‘Bristol pickle’ and as Dillion Hudson - reaching on a fielder’s choice - stole second, baiting a throw, as Caron sprinted home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The throw in from second base was in time but the ball was dropped at the dish as Caron scored to make it 6-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moments later, Tyler Stickles slipped a base hit into short left, Hudson never slowed down after pouncing on third base - easily scoring - as the RBI tally propelled Post 2 to a 7-2 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s fifth started with zest as Beaucar and Osuch drew eight straight balls, putting two out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris then dropped a picture-perfect bunt down the third base line with no chance for Simsbury to get the speedster, loading things up.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron and Fradette then induced back-to-back RBI walks, plating Osuch and Norris, as Bristol squared up an 9-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A ground-out to first by Hudson allowed Churchill to score and Stickles snuck out an infield hit to third - plating one final runner - as Bristol led 11-2 in the middle of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury got a couple back in the bottom of the stanza when JJ Fagnant flipped out an RBI double to left-center and the runner went home on a wild pitch - making it 11-4 through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was sent down in order in the sixth while Simsbury’s Luke Guyer slipped a two-out double to right - scoring on a Bristol error at first base - to trim the deficit to 11-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Beaucar made a spectacular diving catch in right to end the frame as Bristol’s edge going into the seventh was at six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury made it interesting in the bottom of the seventh as the first two batters reached base, ending Cruz’s night on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill took over from there with runners on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 scored two runs on an error and an RBI groundout - making it 11-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Churchill shut the door on any possible comeback with a strikeout as Bristol snared a four-run win to get back to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s nice now we’re back to .500” in the zone said LaPenta. “Tomorrow is a big game [against Torrington]. If we can finish this week and be over .500, I’ll be happy.”</p>
