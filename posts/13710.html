<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern baseball team took it to Maloney halfway through its first round Class L, first round showdown on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But tenth rated Maloney ended up scoring six runs in the bottom of the fourth inning to beat No. 23 Bristol Eastern by a 9-4 final in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans (13-8) moved onto second round play to battle No. 7 Wilcox Tech on Wednesday while the Lancers ended the season with a 9-12 record.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final contest for Eastern seniors Cole Latko, Elliot Norris, Conor McCormick, and captain Jaydon Churchill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Churchill went down swinging, nabbing two hits (double, single), Preston Guarda added two of his own and two RBI while Rio Fernandez had a run scoring triple to highlight the offense for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing early, Eastern scored a run in the top of the fourth to knot the showdown at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Maloney attacked with those six runs in the bottom of the tilt to make it academic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless first frame for the Lancers, Maloney nabbed a quick 2-0 lead in the bottom of the stanza.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a single by Tyler Duffy and a walk, Jesus Arraez drilled a two-out, two-run double to right-centerfield to put the Lancers on the defense immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern earned one of those runs back in the third, trimming the deficit to 2-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A two-out walk to Connor Cyr, a wild pitch, and Guarda's single between short and third trimmed the deficit in half (2-1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, in the top of the fourth, Eastern’s Ryan Maglio opened the inning with a single to center and scored on Fernandez's triple to right-center and it was a brand new game at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was all downhill for Eastern from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s Joziah Gonzalez opened the inning with an infield single to shortstop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Gonzalez stole second and went to third on a Mike Roalf wild pitch, Kyle Valentine walked and stole second to put two runners in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Fitzgerald then singled to center for two runs and ended Roalf's day on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill came on in relief of Roalf with Eastern trailing 4-2.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After generating two outs, Churchill issued a base-on-balls and then Raf Rodriquez hit a three-run homer to left - propelling Maloney to a 7-2 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning pitcher Ryan Killeen followed with a single,&nbsp;pinch runner Ryan Pirruccio stole second and notched Maloney’s eighth run on Arraez's single to center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans added a run in the fifth to nab a 9-2 cushion before the Lancers netted two in the top of the sixth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris singled to center with one out, stole second and when pinch hitter Jose Feliciano walked, Maloney turned to Sam Giacco on the hill.&nbsp; Churchill singled to center to load the bases and Cyr walked to force in Eastern’s third run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Guarda's sacrifice fly made it a 9-4 game but time was running out on Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giacco then retired the Lancers in order in the seventh to seal the 9-4 win and ended another solid campaign by the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Also in first round play in Class L, No. 22 Bristol Central hung in against No. 11 Woodstock Academy but fell by a 4-2 final to finish the season up at 9-12. It was the second consecutive season that Woodstock (13-8) had to battle a squad from Bristol in first round play…Last year, Eastern fell at Woodstock (3-1).</p>
