<p>"It was great to see us put pressure on Platt early and finish our shots," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "We didn't allow Platt to get into their passing game and we put ourselves in good position to score.&nbsp; The deep four backs, Szynal, Landon Gawel, Drew Viens, Sam LaMar, and two central midfielders, John Saraceno&nbsp; and Eli Emmert, cut off Platt's attack."</p>
