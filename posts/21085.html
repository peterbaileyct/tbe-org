<p>William L. “Bill” O’Neil, of Bristol, beloved husband of Jeannine (Gervais) O’Neil, died unexpectedly on Friday, Dec. 16, at John Dempsey Hospital. Bill was born on Dec. 7, 1936, in Bristol and was the only child of the late William J. and Helen (Zipp) O’Neil. </p>

<p>He was a lifelong Bristol resident and graduated from Bristol High School. He attended the Morse School of Business and served in the Connecticut Army National Guard. He enjoyed a 40-year career at Pratt and Whitney Aircraft before retiring. Bill was an avid skier until the age of 84, his favorite place being Mt. Snow. He also enjoyed playing racquetball, playing his last match on Dec. 15, the day before his passing. </p>

<p>His love of good food resulted in him becoming a grill-master. His friends and family requested his famous chicken wings and his grilled chickens. He made his own rubs for the meats that needed them. He loved cooking for others and took great pride in his final product. His love of family was his greatest treasure.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
