<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls tennis team battled Berlin on Friday afternoon, dropping a tough 7-0 decision from the tennis courts at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South confrontation saw the Lancers battle extremely well over doubles play while freshman Vanessa Cyr held her own in singles action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin improved to 3-5 overall while Eastern fell to 0-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In number one singles, Berlin’s Klaudia Fidyk defeated Brooke Treannie in straight sets (6-1, 6-0) while at No. 2, Eastern’s Adrianna Reay gave Olivia Salina a run over the second set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay fell by 6-1 and 6-4 finals while the Redcoats’ Tamarah Al Mozani beat Eastern’s No. 3, Andrea Martir-Perez, by 6-1 and 6-2 scores.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Cyr forced Berlin’s Nadia Kukla into a little first set ‘overtime’ before finally shaking the Kingstreeter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kukla had to sweat out a 7-5 first set before cruising 6-0 over the second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doubles play, Berlin’s top team of Abby Cutler and Lara Hodas defeated the combination of Olivia Dossias and Ava Gesner by duplicate 6-4 scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was the same result in No. 2 doubles, seeing Berlin’s combination of Kaya Rutkowski and Sara Rogan beat Trish Mohan and Kiana Ouellette (6-4, 6-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the third and final doubles match, Eastern’s team of Maria Perrone and Samantha Rivard pushed the Redcoats’ duo of Olivia Robertson and Emily Kubus to the brink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin’s twosome won the first set 6-3, dropped the second 4-6, and had to rebound over the tiebreaker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoat duo secured a 10-4 win in that third set - earning the sweep in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the month of May, Eastern has a real chance to scoop up it first victory of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are home for a CCC South entanglement against Lewis Mills - currently 0-7 - and also looking for victory number one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As always, match time commences at 3:45 p.m.</p>
