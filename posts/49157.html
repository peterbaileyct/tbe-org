<p>Two days this week one of the city's automated trash trucks broke down and the city had to rely on a more traditional approach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We used a conventional rear loader truck with an employee working on the back to dump the barrels," said Josh Corey, superintendent of solid waste with Bristol Public Works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"These trucks are normally used for special collections, such as bulk pick up, leaf bags and Christmas trees," he added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue with the truck was unanticipated, Corey said. The truck had two bad air canisters that were replaced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The fleet department had the air canisters on hand in inventory," Corey said. "All the work was done in house by our mechanics."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the truck was in the fleet shop being repaired by mechanics, he said, it was given a full brake inspection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was no disruption in the regular collection schedule, he said. All residential barrels were collected on their normal scheduled days.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
