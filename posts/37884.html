<p>STORRS – The UConn men’s basketball team continues to make history, remaining undefeated seven games into the 2023-24 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday night, the Huskies moved to 7-0 with their 84-64 triumph over old rival New Hampshire from Gampel Pavilion in Storrs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wildcats (4-3 overall) were simply overwhelmed by Bristol’s Donovan Clingan and the Huskies who established a new national record off the victorious effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn earned its 24th straight victory over a non-conference opponent by double-figures – a new national record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies came into the game against the Wildcats tied with North Carolina who held the previous record at 23 straight games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan was simply on fire versus New Hampshire as he drained 12-of-13 attempts from the field and nailed five-of-seven free throws.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That scoring effort led Clingan to a career-high 29 points to go along with seven rebounds, a blocked shot and a steal over just 21 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made his first 10 field goals while the team shot just under 46-percent from the field overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan’s 29-point effort once again showed the program’s versatility on offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, four different Huskies have hit the 20-point barrier with Clingan the most recent player to accomplish that feat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown against the Wildcats was tied early but a game-changing 16-0 run gave the Huskies the edge for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn steps up this Friday and squares off against one of the top teams in the nation over a special attraction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies tangle with No. 5 Kansas in a BIG EAST-Big 12 Battle on the road. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, from the Allen Fieldhouse, starts at 9 p.m. (ESPN2) and is another big test for Coach Dan Hurley, Clingan and the Huskies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 7-foot-2 Center</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan has seen his playing time increase by about six minutes this season and his output has matched that extended play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 19.3 minutes-per-game, he’s third on the squad in points with 15.0 points-per-game, collecting 6.0 rebounds while just blocking under two shots a night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan is hitting 67.7-percent of his field goals and has done a little something to help the squad stay undefeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He blocked three shots against Northern Arizona, grabbed nine rebounds versus Indiana and has hit 22 of his last 28 shots from the field (78.6-percent).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prorated statistics see Clingan’s scoring numbers climb through the roof.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If played the entire forty minutes, he would average 31.1 points-per-game, numbers he routinely hit as a senior on the Bristol Central boys basketball team in 2021-22 when the Rams went 28-0 and won the CIAC Division II championship.</p>

<p><strong>AP Top 25</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The AP Top 25 poll (from Monday, November 27, 2023) was just released and the Huskies have risen to No. 4 in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That ranking will be challenged against No. 4 Kansas on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how the top five teams shape out this week in the NCAA’s most recent Men’s Division I AP poll:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
