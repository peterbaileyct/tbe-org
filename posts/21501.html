<p>Carol L. (Bradley) Kelley, 80, of Bristol, beloved wife of James D. Kelley died on Saturday, Dec. 31, 2022. at Bristol Hospital. Carol was born on April 20, 1942, in New Britain to Amelia (Naples) and Edward Bradley. Her mother remarried to Michael J. Marchese who helped raise her. The family resided in Plainville until her early teens when they moved to Bristol. </p>

<p>Carol led an adventurous life as she traveled with her husband throughout his 20-year Air Force career allowing her to spend time in Europe, the Middle and Far East, affording her a capability to absorb the cultures of those countries. While stationed in the United States he lived in Texas, New York, Florida, and Virginia for various amounts of time. As a military spouse, Carol was a member of social wives’ clubs at every base. While in Okinawa she was emotionally challenged when their club assisted the hundreds of political refugees of Cambodia.</p>

<p>When her husband retired from the Air Force they returned home to Connecticut where both their families lived. Carol worked at Torrant House residential facility in Plainville as an assistant manager for three years, then moved on to the assistant manager's job at DeLorenzo Towers in Bristol. Shortly after, she accepted the position as manager of the facility. She retired after working 20 years for EHDOC. The residents often described her as a conscientious, friendly, and a more than capable manager, and was missed upon her retirement. </p>

<p>Carol enjoyed her work with the residents and was missed upon her retirement. She maintained ties to many of them during her retirement. Retirement allowed her to spend more time with her family and grow her circle of friends. She was very sociable and looked forward to going out for long lunches to visit and chat. Carol was often referred to as a beautiful, sophisticated, and empathetic person. She was the person people would visit for advice and encouragement. Her experiences helped guide many people through challenging times.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
