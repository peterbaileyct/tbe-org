<p>For St. Paul pitcher Logan Rembish, the game got off to a rough start. Torrington lead off man Dom Dibecelle hit a routine grounder on the first pitch, but the throw to 1st was wild for a two base error. Shortstop Dean Busso followed with a single driving in Dibecelle, and Torrington had a quick 1-0 lead. Busso advanced to 2nd on a passed ball, and then attempted to steal 3rd. On the play, the throw to 3rd was wild and got past the third baseman allowing Busso to score and make it 2-0.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From that point on, Rembish took over the game and began dominating the Torrington hitters. Rembish retired the next twelve Torrington batters in order, striking out eight of them to earn his 4th win on the year. </p>

<p>The Falcon offense scored early and often erasing the early two run deficit. In the bottom of the 1st, Jamie Leggett singled and Devin Kulas walked to put two men on. Cal Chance followed with an RBI single to cut Torrington's early lead in half. Cole Raymond hit an infield single to load the bases, and Ryan Kilpatrick had an RBI single to tie the score 2-2. Jonathan Remillard singled to give St Paul a 3-2 lead, and an errant throw allowed Raymond to score and make it 4-2. </p>

<p>In the bottom of the 2nd, Leggett walked, stole 2nd, and advanced to 3rd on Kulas's single. A balk allowed Kulas to go to 2nd and Leggett to score making it 5-2. Chance walked and Raymond doubled to make it 6-2. Chance scored on Kilpatrick's RBI groundout, and Raymond scored on Remillard's RBI single. A single by AJ Corrado and a walk to Keaton Kroll loaded the bases. Rembish then drove in 2 with a single, and St. Paul led 10-2.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 3rd, the Falcons took advantage of three Torrington errors to score four unearned runs. In the bottom of the 4th, a double by Leggett and a SAC  fly by Raymond made it 15-2.</p>

<p>Torrington mounted a rally off reliever Tyler Kiluk in the top of the 5th. Kiluk had control problems, and Torrington took advantage of a single by Matt Liefert, two walks, and three hit batters to score three and make it 15-5. But Torrington was unable to get one more run to avoid the mercy rule, and the game ended 15-5. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
