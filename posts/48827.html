<p>The second block party in as many months will be held at Yellow King Brews from 12 noon to 7 p.m. today, Saturday, July 27.</p>

<p>“It was a good turn-out for the first one,” co-owner Shama Khan said, but she acknowledged that she is looking for a better turnout, especially since the party is on the same day at the Bristol Farmers Market.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was pretty good,” she said, even though “It was a slow start.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either way, she said she is excited about today's event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The block party will feature New Haven Underground Jazz outside and DJ LoveJoy playing inside, Khan said. In addition, the event will have food trucks, live music, vendors, and Espresso Martini specials. Yellow Kings is located at the Bristol Bazaar on 67 Race St.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
