<p>Ann’s interest in the hospitality industry sprouted from a longtime passion for travel and world culture. Watching TV shows, such as The Amazing Race<em>,</em>&nbsp;and learning about the vast cultures and lifestyles unique to many regions of the world gave her big dreams at a young age. With a desire to spend her life traveling and making people smile through her work, Ann began cooking when she was 12, and her passion has only continued to grow since then.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
