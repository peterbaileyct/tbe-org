<p>NEW HAVEN - At the 2023 CCC Indoor Track &amp; Field Conference Championships from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven this past Saturday, the boys from Bristol Eastern were in rare form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And couple school records were broken that day at the league’s premier indoor track event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the boys 4x200 relay, the combination of Preston Poirier, Rayshon Andrews, Damien Colon and Jack Mulcunry established a new Lancers’ standard with a finish of one minute, 36.8 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That time was good enough for third place overall at the event from New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that team wasn’t the only grouping that breached an Eastern record on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys Sprint Medley Relay team saw most of that same group smash another Eastern record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with cross country standout Dominic Tartarelli, Poirier, Andrews and Mulcunry finished the race with a new school ledger of 3:46.52 as the Lancers did very well on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the grand scheme of things, the time gave the Eastern crew third place overall at the ultra competitive meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also that day, Andrews placed ninth in the preliminaries of the 55 meter dash, seizing ninth overall with a time of 6.75 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mulcunry ran an efficient 600 meter race, snaring third place overall in 1:26.52 which wasn’t far off the winning mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall’s Jon York won the 600 meter event with a time of 1:24.04 to seize the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 1000 meters, Tartarelli made an eighth place finish in a time of 2:43.31 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern performed well in the 4x800 meter relay as the grouping of Dom and Aidan Tartarelli, along with Cole Beland and Aidan Gezelman, earned seventh place, clocking in at 8:56.73.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Kingstreeters placed 11th - right in the middle of the pack - as Eastern collected 19 total points - tied with Wethersfield and just three points away from eighth place East Hartford (22 points).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of the finish in the CCC South, the Lancers ended up with 61 points for a fourth place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls side from Eastern, the squad placed fourth in the CCC South&nbsp;&nbsp;standings - notching 42 points for fourth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ 1600 Sprint Medley crew had a good finish, nabbing ninth place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team of Julia Armington, Darlissa McElroy, Kate Patterson and speedster Kaelyn Gonzalez finished with a time of 4:42.78.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls high jump saw Ryan Braccia seize eleventh place as she made a completion of four feet, eight inches to keep pace with the field.</p>
