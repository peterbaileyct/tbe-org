<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Central girls basketball squad is on a bit of a hot streak as the calendar year has turned to 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams went 1-2 over their first three games, but off a very spirited showing at Simsbury on Dec. 20, it’s been all down hill for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a stretch of eight days, Central has posted victories against Maloney (69-38), Platt (69-25) and won the BC Holiday Classic last Friday via a 57-54 final against Canton.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the game at Simsbury, a contest Central was down just a couple possessions in during fourth period play, looked to be the squad’s tipping point to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The game that turned us around was the game in Simsbury,” said Central coach Steve Gaudet. “That’s one of the better teams in the entire state and it was a six-point game in the fourth quarter. I had freshmen, sophomores and a bunch of young kids out there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the BC Holiday Classic saw his program enter tournament play at .500, earned the championship with triumphs over Wolcott Tech and Gilbert, and then went on to win six straight games overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those victories helped to establish a ton of chemistry for the team and Gaudet sees those same kind of similarities this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s about getting more court time as a group and putting the finished product on the hardwood each and every outing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re starting to play a little more together,” said Gaudet. “[They’re] a little more mature and they’re getting experience. It’s showing.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>She’s (almost) back…</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In&nbsp;a couple weeks, a familiar face will be ready to return to varsity action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior standout Brook Watson has been a big part of the program’s success over the years and her return is going to bolster the backcourt -- in a major way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, Watson played in 22 of the squad’s 24 games (Central went 17-7 overall) and, frankly, the guard is a nifty shooter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program drained over 30 three-pointers last year and Watson was responsible for nearly half of that total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watson was also the team-leader in free throws made (46) and came in third place in total points (195).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She averaged 8.9 points-per-game while her 22-point effort last season was the most points any player at Central scored in a single game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her experience will be critical over second half play as will her shooting and playmaking abilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Watson sits and recovers from that broken collarbone, Central’s younger core, including the likes of freshmen Laylani Cespedes and Olivia Louis have been getting plenty of court time and earning big fourth quarter minutes that will only help the program in the long run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re biding our time until we get Brooke back,” said Gaudet of Watson. “The young kids are taking advantage of that opportunity. We’re getting better and in the long run, it’s going to help us.” &nbsp;</p>
