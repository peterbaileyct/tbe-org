<p>WEST HARTFORD - Participants from fifty programs took part of the 2022 CIAC Boys Swimming Open on March 19, including the excellent team from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Bristol Coop did an incredible job - placing in the top-15 - and had more than a couple standouts in the pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the day in 14th place, notching 127 points which was 9.5 points better than Oxford (15th place, 117.5 points).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an individual front, Bristol’s Mikel Palaj swam well over a couple different events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 50-yard freestyle, Palaj won the race, finishing in 21.13 seconds to earn his squad 30 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palaj then placed third in the 100-yard butterfly over another excellent display.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Palaj wasn’t far off the winning mark as Greenwich’s Ryan Jee earned the win with a time of 49.29 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palaj’s third place time was clocked at 50.06 seconds as the senior had a very good showing in the pool from West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the 100-yard breaststroke, Bristol’s Nathan Stellmach placed fifth overall in 58.73 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Bristol, the combination of Aiden Collins, Stellmach, Palaj, and Davis Kroll finished 12th in the 200-yard medley relay (1:40.26) while and in the 200-yard IM, Stellmach placed 22nd (2:01.02).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 400-yard freestyle relay, the foursome of Palaj, Noah Taylor, Kroll, and Stellmach tagged the wall in 3:20.36 for 18th place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Greenwich won the Open - collecting 611 points and easily topped runner-up Pomperaug (367 points).</p>
