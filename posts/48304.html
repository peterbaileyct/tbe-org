<p>I’ve mentioned the Hartford Circus Fire of July 6, 1944 here, and have more to share on this disaster regarding local and neighboring folks. First is the fact that two individuals died in or from the fire. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Registered nurse Marion Rose (Blanchard) LeVasseur, 32, died that tragic day while under the trapping tent. A resident of 761 Burlington Ave., she had attended the circus with her son, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gerald, 6, and other survivors, Marge Eustice, Marion Linxwiler and her daughter, Mary Ann. Mrs. LeVasseur is buried in St. Joseph Cemetery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s second victim was Mrs. Anne (Doyle) Thompson of East Road. She attended the circus with her husband Joe and daughter, Judith. Anne died from her injuries at Hartford Hospital a year later on July 11, 1945.</p>

<p>Some of those who didn’t survive from neighboring towns were higher in numbers. Plainville had casualties: Ann Berube (5), Mrs. George Brooks, and children, Dorothy, George and James; Nellie Hart (69); Walter and Hortense Murphy, and son, Charles; and Eleanor and Oliver Snelgrove.</p>

<p>Congratulations to a high school classmate of mine, Noreen Zurell who takes over the presidential reins at the Bristol Historical Society. Interesting to note that position has been held by a number of 1962 and 1963 graduates from Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Saman and Tom Dickau were classmates in 1962 and Noreen and myself from 1963. Lidia Jasinski, another classmate was a longtime v.p. when the late Jeanne DiPietro presided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our late high school principal George Perry was the founding president of the organization. Not a history buff in high school, Mr. Perry is probably looking down and shaking his head at me as I write this. You never know!</p>

<p><strong>Jack Denehy - Mike Thomas</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, where would be without the late Jack Denehy. Thanks to him we have the Memorial Military Museum of Bristol, and the Jack Denedy Gallery. Since opening decades ago, folks from all over have donated precious photos and items regarding military Bristol, which is housed at the Bristol Historical Society.&nbsp; What is seen on the main floor of the building is only a sample of what is housed on the second floor Scads of priceless goodies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now for Mr. Thomas, the president. Years ago, he told Jack that he would help him with the museum when he retired from teaching. Well, he has in stepping up in helping to lead the organization. I don’t know if visitors there know all the time and effort he puts in. I’ve seen it firsthand.<br><br><strong>Shout out to Brian Johnson</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was writing for The Bristol Press, one of my favorite people there was Brian Johnson. I’m glad he’s still there, because he does such a fine job for Bristol news.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mark Monnerat, Sr.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before closing out this week, I just got word that Mark Monnerat, Sr., former Catholic school educator, principal and coach died on July 2, in Florida. He leaves a loving family and many friends. He was special!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
