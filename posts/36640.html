<p>For District 2, voters have the choice between incumbents Sue Tyler (R) and Jacqueline Olsen (R) and challengers Morris "Rippy" Patton (D) and Liza Salgado-Sirko (D). Responses to TBE questions from Tyler and Patton are listed below. Olsen did not respond. Salgado-Sirko did respond after the article appeared to say that she did not receive the questions. It appears the TBE misspelled the email address. We regret the error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answers to the questions appear just as the candidate stated, with the exception of minor copy editing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Questions for incumbents are slightly different from those of challengers.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do you consider to be your major accomplishments during your term? And why? Not all but the most significant ones, please.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my accomplishments in my first term was “re-branding” the position of city councilor. I aimed to have all constituents know my name, have my contact information, and to be accessible to all. I worked hard to be a leader with an open-door policy and held many community discussions on different issues. I encouraged all constituents to be community partners in addressing the issues that are present in our neighborhoods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another accomplishment was my work as the chair of the Ordinance Committee. All new ordinances were thoroughly researched, debated, subject to public input, and most importantly were fair and equitable to all in their application. There were a handful of contentious items and sensitive topics, where I can say without doubt that the ordinance committee went to great lengths to create these new laws with care for all in our community. We also cleaned up many old, antiquated ordinances. We had a fair share of proposals that we passed on if it was determined that the ordinance process wasn’t the best avenue to take.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An accomplishment that I am very passionate about is my work as a Code Enforcement Liaison. Having an effective well run Code Enforcement program is essential to the desirability factor of attracting/retaining those who want to live, work and play in our city. In addition to working on complaints with the other team members, I have assisted in improving the systems and the partnerships of the Code Enforcement members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And lastly, perhaps my top accomplishment is my work with local businesses. Being a business owner myself, I know the importance of promoting and marketing local businesses and creating an environment to encourage shopping &amp; eating local. I have worked with many of our businesses and connect them with resources and assist them in forming partnerships with other businesses and organizations. I am a proud Central CT Chamber of Commerce member, member of the Midstate Association of Realtors, and am involved with various business networking groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do you consider to be the most critical or significant moments over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our most critical moments became our most critical months. Bristol’s biggest heartbreak of my lifetime was the horrific loss of our two police officers. Each of us has different versions of how our hearts broke that night. For me personally it hit on several different levels; City Councilwoman, Police Commissioner, Retired Farmington Police Officer and a Bristol resident. For our community it ran deep from devastating grief &amp; sadness to a sense of fear and loss of security. The one saving grace that got us through this challenging time was the outpouring of love for our PD and for each other. This community stepped up in a way that only Team Bristol could. I am proud of the role that we as City leaders played in supporting our police officers, their families, and this community behind the scenes making crucial decisions to do our part in getting everyone through a dark time. I pray that no administration ever has to deal with such an event again.</p>

<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as a result of your experience over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to November 2021: 35+ years of public service, Alternate on Zoning Commission, Board of Directors of St. Vincent De Paul Mission of Bristol, Member of the Midstate Association of Realtors Grievance Committee.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>November 2021-Current: Chairwoman of Ordinance, Chairwoman of Real Estate, Salary, Police Commission, Code Enforcement Committee, and the Police Memorial Subcommittee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I view the City as moving in a positive direction with improvements in the economic growth and marketability of Bristol. Revitalization can be seen in the vast majority of our neighborhoods and with many of our businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my capacity as City Councilor, as well as being a real estate professional, the feedback and shared thoughts of what is going on in Bristol is overwhelmingly positive and is confirmation on my views of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if reelected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think one of Bristol’s biggest challenges in the next two years will be addressing the housing crisis. Our homeless population is increasing, with the largest sector being senior citizens. The rental market and the housing market are not only difficult but traumatizing for most. Extremely low inventory and high interest rates has made securing housing impossible for many. I am not sure how this will play out over the next two years, since we are reacting to directions and decisions made three years ago, but I am fairly confident that in the short term we need to recognize the problem and get creative on how everyone has the opportunity to fulfill a basic human need, shelter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Continue my work on a personal and professional level. Educate our community on what the real problems are and how this will affect all of us. Work with the Mayor to form an action group to address this public health crisis of homelessness, specifically on the local level.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For myself, I'm anxious to&nbsp;see Bristol get back to the momentum&nbsp;we had prior to this current administration. Many of my favorite local businesses have closed since this administration took office and they have offered no vision or value for the tax dollars we spend. I want to see Bristol make the news for the good people and effort they give.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I&nbsp;live in the second&nbsp;district which houses&nbsp;a large percentage&nbsp;of people struggling on a day to day basis. The prior administration worked tooth and nail to get Bristol an incredible resource like Wheeler Clinic to move their&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;headquarters to our city. A few years ago, Bristol was close to the top of the list in terms of opioid&nbsp;overdoses in&nbsp;Connecticut. We need them here. Last year alone, Wheeler treated just under 40,000 people statewide struggling with substance&nbsp;abuse issues. The deal was done, and our all-Republican administration told them "No". It&nbsp;took the will&nbsp;of the people to demand they fix that mistake and represent us, not&nbsp;themselves. Even when they went back to the table and voted again, Susan Tyler and Jaqueline Olsen voted "no" on bringing mental health and substance abuse services to Bristol. Jeff Caggiano attributed their votes to the stigma that exists on mental health and substance abuse. That should be unacceptable going forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies you for office?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I&nbsp;have served Bristol as the Vice Chair and then Chairman of the Democratic Town Committee under the guidance and leadership of Dean Kilbourne who has been an incredible mentor. I've also served as a Vice President with the NAACP and sat on the boards of many of our critical non-profit organizations. In my opinion, political credentials are directly tied to how you've served people in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are a&nbsp;work&nbsp;in progress and just need the right people in the right positions. As a stakeholder in Bristol, I'm incredibly disappointed that we have the mayor and city council we currently have, but I'm inspired every day by the work of our volunteer community, the current bipartisan Board of Education and hard-working city employees.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first time I ever spoke to our&nbsp;current mayor he called me to chastise me for calling out some of the online racism that was coming from a person who claimed to be associated with Bristol's Republican Town Committee. His words were deeply offensive,&nbsp;and I told him that. That was seven years ago to the day. Two months ago, we had to have a press conference in Bristol that made national news about racism. We have to make progress, not regress or stay stagnant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before Mayor Caggiano was mayor and sat on the Board of Education, he stood staunchly against the community conversations on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. I was a facilitator&nbsp;at the first two and was there when he took the microphone and spoke about how productive those conversations were for him. Then he became Mayor and cancelled them. That sends a loud message to a percentage of Bristol that I'm proud to be included in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also need to start talking about what the vision is for Bristol. If we open 10 more vape shops, 10 more liquor stores and 5 more Dollar Generals, technically that's&nbsp;economic development. But is it the economic development that we the people as stakeholders want?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if elected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If elected I open the doors to City Hall to people that right now feel that they are closed to them. The most consistent feedback that I receive while door knocking is that under this administration, people feel excluded and left out. They aren't comfortable going to a city council meeting and talking to council. I have a young neighbor that works at ESPN and recently had his driveway wash away. If elected, he can come knock on my door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply being available makes all of the difference. I'm outside in Bristol all of the time. The first time I saw one of my city council representatives in public was last Saturday. Two years after her election. I want to listen, learn and act for everyone and the only way to that is by being available and transparent.</p>
