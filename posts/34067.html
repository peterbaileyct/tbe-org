<p>The Bulldogs wasted no time, initiating an early passing attack that saw them complete several breathtaking deep throws. The highlight of this aerial display was Bryce Brewer's stunning reception of a 35-yard bomb, piercing through the speedy Monroe defense. This impressive play set the stage for Rienaldo Soto's explosive 30-yard rushing touchdown.</p>

<p> Anchored by a formidable offensive line, Bristol dominated with a total of five touchdowns, where Quincy Stewart Roman's commanding presence on the line even included two successful extra point conversions. Mario Walker took advantage of his dominant line and moved the ball with multiple good rushes between the tackles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite Monroe's valiant efforts to stay in the game, Bristol's unrelenting defense proved insurmountable. The relentless pressure applied by Noah Vargas and Jathaniel Rosado consistently disrupted Monroe's quarterback, with numerous tackles made in the backfield. Building on his exceptional performance from the previous week, Jojo Koch added two more interceptions to his record, while Peyton Bip contributed with multiple deflections, forcing Monroe to rely more on their less favored ground game.</p>

<p>A late-game twist left Monroe perplexed and dazed. Peyton Bip executed a clever reverse to Rienaldo Soto, who dashed down the sideline for a jaw-dropping 60-yard touchdown run, marking his second score of the game.</p>

<p>Monroe, however, refused to go quietly. They managed to recover three onside kicks and leveled the playing field at 30-30 in the waning moments of the fourth quarter. With the game hanging in the balance, a Monroe runner appeared poised to break free towards the sideline, threatening Bristol's grasp on victory. In a moment of sheer heroics, the lightning-fast Soto stripped the ball and sprinted down the sideline. With just one defender left to beat, his co-captain and friend, DJ Smith, delivered a crucial block, allowing Soto to cruise into the endzone, securing his third touchdown and ultimately, the Bristol Bulldogs' thrilling triumph. The Bulldogs won 36-30, with a record of 2-0. Their next game is Sunday, September 24th in Wallingford.&nbsp;</p>
