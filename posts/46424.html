<p><strong>Good Times </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My youngest daughter, Jessica Colangelo, posted three photos on FACEBOOK the other day of three former Bristol Press stalwarts, Peter Maronn, Bob Harrington and me. I was surprised by it all, but not wanting to push my photo onto others. Either way, this brought back a lot of fond memories for me of The Press.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never met Bob but did run into Peter when he photographed me at the main library, that of dusting bookshelves. His wording under the photo was: "Dust To Dust,” and boy I was teased about that one. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My time at the library and newspaper were simply wonderful for me. Met many fine folks.</p>

<p><strong>Frederick G. Schaffrick (95)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see that Fred died recently. He probably had no idea that I knew who he was, but I did. His Lewis Street Auto Body was on my way home for years, and I often saw&nbsp; him or his son, Glenn, when I passed by the shop. This went on for years and I always thought they were two gentlemen, although we rarely spoke to one another.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fred was a WWII veteran who served in Germany during WWII. Thank you for your service!</p>

<p><strong>Falls Brook</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mentioned this brook and road recently, and believe I found its origin. It began in Sessions Woods as (N-Word) Hill Falls, or something like that. Of course, we understand why this name was changed. If you recall when I wrote about it&nbsp; I mentioned I would look into its origin. Mission completed.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ebert Road, while on the subject of names, was constructed in 1957 and named after a family which had owned Ebert Electric. Ebert Drive was also named for that family.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Donovan Clingan</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My thoughts on him with regards to the NBA Draft. I have read many articles on him, and one listed him as No. 1 in the draft. I’ve also seen him higher ranked. My predictions as of today is No. 7?</p>

<p><strong>Shoutouts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go to Marty Hurwitz, one of my favorites, Bernie O’Keefe once again, Gary Palladino, Malcolm Merriman, a basketball teammate of Gary’s at Greene-Hills School during the late 1960’s and to the family of the late E. Bartlett Barnes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Barnes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking about Bart, he was one of Bristol’s key leaders during the last century. He was involved in so many key activities to better Bristol. He’d be an interesting subject for a paperback biography.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m thinking that Malcolm Huckaby may have been the most talented of all of Bristol’s hoop stalwarts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
