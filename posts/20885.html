<p>BRISTOL – Due to all sorts of lovely mathematical formulas the CIAC uses to determine how to sort its sports teams for postseason play, the boys basketball program over at Bristol Central – the defending Division II champions – won’t be playing in that division anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams got booted up to Division I play which has some of the best programs the state of Connecticut has to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A perk of being shipped up to Division I is automatic playoff qualification and Central will certainly take it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it’s certainly a plus, it also means that a team could play in the postseason despite a record of less than eight wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season in Division I play, 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;ranked Glastonbury finished the season at 4-16 overall but still managed to give No. 11 Manchester a run in first round play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Hawks won 63-57 over a close encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Central coach Tim Barrette believes this squad could end up with a couple more victories than people would expect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I keep telling the players no one has any expectations for us,” said Barrette. “So let’s prove everyone wrong and that’s kind of the us against the world mentality. Last year, we had that approach because everyone wanted us to lose and fail. This year, we’re just going to go the opposite way with it. No one expects us to win now.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So it’s us against the world. We have to play for each other.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the complete list of the CIAC’s Division I programs in 2022-23:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Central&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Danbury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Wilbur Cross<br>*Wilton&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of these squads fell to Central last season as the program was on a quest to win a state title.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While that mission was accomplished in 2021-22, how will the current squad over at Central fare against this lot in Division I?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll certainly find out over the nextf few months.   </p>
