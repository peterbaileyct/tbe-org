<p>Mickey is the dedicated and loving husband of Patricia (Moore) Dragon for 44 years. Mickey worked for the State of Connecticut at UConn Medical Center for 29 years. Many friends referred to Mickey as Rapstar. He looked forward to family parties, having a cookout, and spending time waving to neighbors and friends as he relaxed in his favorite hang-out spot, his garage. </p>

<p>Mickey loved a good comedy movie, all kinds of music, especially oldies, had an eye for classic cars, and woodwork. He was a life-long fan of the Boston Red Sox and the Green Bay Packers. His family knows that he is in heaven playing catch with his two beloved Boston Terriers, Max and Rocky. Spending time with his grandchildren brought him so much joy.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
