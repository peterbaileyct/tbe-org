<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central football team has hit the season running, carrying a 1-3 ledger after four games – playing several tough teams that help make up the CCC’s challenging Tier II division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Jeff Papazian has his hands full against some truly talented competition, but the long-time mentor has been there, done that and will continue to put all the right pieces into play for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central managed to score its lone victory of the season in a Connecticut Football Alliance showdown against Fairfield Warde – posting a 42-13 victory, getting that first all-important win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Jack Hartley has been running the offense for Central and the former All-Conference standout from Bristol Eastern has more than earned his keep.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The athlete leads the program in rushes (96), yardage (344), rushing touchdowns (3), passes made and attempted, yardage thrown (43) and touchdowns (1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He averages 3.6 yards-per-carry and truly does a little of everything for the team at Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley, at 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds is a certifiable bulldog on the field and will continue to put up numbers as the season progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He might not be Victor Rosa or Tre Blair, but Hartley certainly packs a punch out on the field, crashing into opposing defenses off those direct snaps.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley was a big factor in Central getting off the snide against Fairfield Warde but he’s not the only player churning out offense for the Rams to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper cashed in on 29 carries for 100 yards (3.4 yards-per-carry) for a touchdown while back Tristian Toussaint (22 carries, 145 yards, 6.6 yards-per- carry, two TDs) has been extremely productive this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Paulino (eight rushes, 131 yards, two TDs) also provided a spark while Cassias Breland, Donato Salzillo, Ty Chasse and Aidan Lamarre all making rushes for the Central team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quincy Lawson (five catches, 37 yards, TD) and Breland (two catches, 25 yards) have helped move the chains via receptions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Defense</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After four games, senior standout Jack Jones is leading the squad in tackles (11.3-per-game) and tackles for losses (seven).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Ryan (7.3 tackles-per-game) has been getting things done defensively as has Lamarre (6.3, two tackles for losses).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tim Sample and Lawson each average nearly four tackles-per-game while Julieen Lopez, Lawson and Lamarre have all managed to pick off a pass this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of defense, Central allowed 37 total points over first half play but yielded 60 points over third and fourth period action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central hopes to continue to improve upon that defense but must contend with several heavy hitters from Tier II over the next several games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>One game left before the bye week</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a tough task to tackle this Thursday as Berlin (3-1) travels to Bristol for a CCC Tier II event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After being shutout against Wilton, the Redcoats have won three straight – averaging 38.0 points-per-game over that stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It certainly would be a feather in Central’s cap to knock Berlin off the friendly confines of the turf field at BCHS. Game time is 6:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
