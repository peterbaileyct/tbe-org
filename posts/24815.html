<p>Bristol Central’s girls lacrosse team went back and forth against a feisty coop squad from Middletown/Coginchaug on Monday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for the second time over a six-day period, the Middletown contingent was able to hang a loss on a squad from Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After defeating Bristol Eastern by a 12-11 push on April 4, Middletown was able to just sneak by the Rams over an 8-7 final from the turf field at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown improved to 2-0 overall while Central fell to 1-1 on the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tough loss at home to Middletown tonight,” said Central coach Kyle Phelan via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaylynn LaPointe led the scoring charge for Central with four goals while Rachel Wygant added two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Lowe also netted a score for the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defense hung in as Central allowed just eight goals in the contest, giving the offense chances over match play to keep pace.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] defense and Amy [Pelletier] played tough!” said Phelan. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams look to get back in the win column on Thursday in a CCC South confrontation against Lewis Mills.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is set for noon from the turf field at Bristol Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Central’s match against Wolcott on Friday is going to be changed to 2:30 p.m. instead of its original time of 6 p.m.….Keep Tuesday April 25 open as Central and Eastern battle it out at 7 p.m. from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS in a city series explosion.&nbsp;</p>
