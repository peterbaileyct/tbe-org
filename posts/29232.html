<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harvest Bakery announced on its Facebook page that it will be back to normal beginning this morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are back!" the post reads. "Starting Wednesday morning we will be back to normal operations, and we are better than ever!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An earlier post asks for patience after the bakery's 60-year-old oven malfunctioned, resulting in some challenges with parts and labor to get it up and running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We sincerely apologize to anyone who was inconvenienced by our shutdown," the post continues. "We have issued refunds to everyone who pre-paid with a credit card, and for those who paid with cash, please stop by any time this week when we're open and we are happy to give you your money back."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Bristol institution, over almost eight decades, Harvest has provided not just fresh bakery items for individuals over the counter but also baked goods for many businesses in the area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Thank you to all who have stood by us through this and helped spread the word about what we have been going through!" the post ends. "Not everyone uses social media and sometimes rumors are spread, so thank you for all of your help getting the word out."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
