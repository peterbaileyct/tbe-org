<p>The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team has rolled out to a perfect 4-0 record this season, picking up its most recent victory on Thursday night. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program from Platt came to town for a CCC South encounter and after just a few minutes, the game was already out of reach for the Panthers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern blitzed Platt for 27 straight points to open the game as the Kingstreeters zipped up a 47-13 victory from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt fell to 0-4 off the losing effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers got contributions from every player that evening as Amanda Noel cashed in with a career-high 18 points and added 12 rebounds, good for another double-double.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also blocked three shots and had six steals to lead the charge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cassie Sward got the start and cashed in a season best 11 points and four steals while Autumn Udoh wrapped up eight points, six rebounds and a couple steals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Drury nabbed six points, three rebounds, a team-high five assists and three steals while sister Savannah Drury tallied three points and two assists.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natalia Vye added a fourth quarter hoop while Lauren Ayotte nearly had a single-double again, this time in steals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied a career-high eight steals as Eastern forced Platt into 47 turnovers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alaina Joy, Emily Zurowski, Jennah Azab and Rabiatu Bah all hit the court for the Kingstreeters that evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No player from Platt scored more than three points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point of the contest, Eastern led 27-0 with under a minute to play at the half before the Panthers scored on three free throws, trailing by 24 going into the break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern opened the third period with an 9-0 burst as Vanessa Drury put in a lay-up, Noel canned two free throws, Sward made a conventional three-point play and when Drury added yet another high-percentage hoop, the home team led 38-3 with 3:59 remaining in the tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through three completed periods, it was a 40-8 game in favor of the Lancers and even with the reserves mopping up in the end, Eastern never lost its edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters finished the final quarter by outscoring the Panthers 7-5 to rope up a 47-13 victory to remain undefeated on the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>This showdown against the Panthers won’t be the only time Eastern will see Platt this season. The squads meet in a rematch on Friday, February 2 from Orville H. Platt High School in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
