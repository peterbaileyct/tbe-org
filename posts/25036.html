<p>Scholastic records are made to be broken, especially in the world of track &amp; field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over the years at Bristol Eastern, most of those amazing standards have stood the test of time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at the recent 2023 Lady Hawks Track &amp; Field Invitational this past weekend, history was made at the event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of that record breaking was done by Rayshon Andrews as the football standout was simply tremendous over two short but challenging sprints.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrews established new standards at Eastern in the 100 and 200 meter events, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 100, Andrews made it to the finish line in 11.24 seconds for second place, just off the 11.21 winning time by Windsor’s Taeshawn Berry.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 11.24 seconds was a record setter for the Lancers but the athlete was not done yet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 200 meter race, Andrews won it - finishing the event in 22.22 seconds for another Lancers’ record.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrews broke both records established by speedster Joe Hardin in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hardin’s 100 meter ledger of 11.44 seconds and 200 time of 22.8 are now the old records at the high school over on King Street.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tremendous day for Andrews but it wasn’t just all about the quick sprinting events.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Mulcunry broke the 800 meter record with a time of 2:00.62 from the same event, another big finish for the Eastern program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former soccer standout Patrick Plourde was the holder of the old record, finishing the twice around the track race in 2:02.85 back in 2010.&nbsp;</p>
