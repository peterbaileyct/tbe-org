<p>BRISTOL - After a recent three game losing streak by the Bristol Central boys basketball team, veteran coach Tim Barrette tweaked his lineup a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette was going to senior Harry Ross at forward/center and the front court player was producing for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a little more energy was added to the starting unit when sophomore Quincy Lawson was swapped in for Ross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He plays hard. It’s just hard to keep him off the floor,” said Barrette of Lawson. “He’s been earning that spot. Nothing against Harry. I need Harry to play a ton still. He’ll still play his minutes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The switch is a good one because now Ross can come off the pine to rebound, block shots and put in a couple misses to lead the second unit while Lawson - like the Energizer Bunny - seemingly has a motor that doesn’t quit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 2-7 overall this year, Barrette was hoping that the athletic Lawson would move the needle against an equally positioned program such as Platt (2-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawson averages 6.4 points-per-game, third on the team, but his lay-ups and put-backs are just part of the equation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can rebound over anyone, he’ll hit the hardwood without a thought and those hustle points are mentally tracked by Barrette and his staff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Platt last Thursday, Lawson posted seven points, grabbing two early offensive rebounds and the baskets off those misses gave Central a 23-12 edge over Platt with 5:38 to go in the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His hustle and guile made a big difference over the first half of play before Central eventually fell to Platt 59-57.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just thought with the way Platt goes after the ball, I needed a different spark,” said Barrette. “With Quincy’s energy, I thought that was the best move for tonight to try to get off to a good start and honestly, we did.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That move definitely paid off tonight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the fall, everyone saw what Lawson brought to Central’s football program for head coach Jeff Papazian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That ability helped him achieve on the football field and in hoop from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can score as his team-leading 11 points against Bristol Eastern during the BC Holiday Invitational nearly got the job accomplished against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s not a ball out of his reach or an open player he can’t get to defensively when the sophomore is in the area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Lawson might just be scratching the surface in Barrette’s offensive and defensive schemes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The one thing I know is that he’s going to literally leave everything he has on the floor, good or bad,” said Barrette.</p>
