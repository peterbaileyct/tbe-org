<p>Hundreds of Bristol residents gathered on Memorial Boulevard on Monday to honor fallen heroes and commemorate the completion of long-awaited projects. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Memorial Day events began with a short procession from Hope Street to the Memorial Boulevard bridge. Community members lined the sidewalks to salute passing veterans and listen to patriotic performances from the Bristol Eastern Marching Band.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immediately following the procession, representatives from local veteran organizations and city officials participated in a ceremony to honor all of the Bristol veterans who died in service to their country. The ceremony began with the national anthem played by the Bristol Eastern Marching band, followed by an opening prayer and the POW/MIAs ceremony. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The names of every Bristol soldier who died in World War I, World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam were read aloud so that their sacrifices may never be forgotten, and Boy Scout and Cub Scout troops laid wreaths on the monuments honoring fallen soldiers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ceremony closed with final military honors as American Legion Post 2 fired an honorary three-round volley while taps was by a bugle player from Bristol Eastern High School. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As we look to the men and women from the past and the present, the veterans who have given the supreme sacrifice, we can never say thank you enough," said guest speaker Command Sgt. Major Edward Litherland.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bridge dedication</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The completion of the Veterans Memorial Boulevard bridge was commemorated with speeches by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano, Director of Public Works Ray Rogozinski, and Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Superintendent Dr. Joshua Medeiros. Obelisks, plaques and monuments were constructed on the east entry of the Memorial Boulevard in honor of veterans from all branches of the military.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The Bridge is designed to make a statement," said Rogozinski, "each of the corners has a plaque that represents one of the branches of the military."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Urban Garden unveiled </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A ribbon cutting ceremony was held to commemorate the completion of the Urban Garden on Memorial Boulevard. Located near the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School, the tranquil garden features professionally landscaped plants and trees, and Medeiros, Bristol Parks System Deputy Superintendent Sarah Larson and City Councilor Andrew Howe were joined by community members for the ceremonial unveiling. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The Urban Garden was the result of a 2022 Urban Forest Initiative grant the department received, which allowed us to remove the blighted tennis courts and replace them with over 26,000 square feet of tree canopy," said Medeiros.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bench dedication ceremony</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members of TEAM Bristol dedicated a granite memorial bench by the Memorial Boulevard pond in memory of all of the fallen Bristol veterans. In the upcoming months a plaque will be added underneath the bench to honor former Bristol Mayor Art Ward who was very supportive of the Memorial Boulevard project. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We're very particular with what goes on the Boulevard," said TEAM Bristol member Bob Barnett, "and we're proud of this bench." </p>
