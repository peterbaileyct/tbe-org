<p><strong>The O’Keefes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stopped by last week to visit with Bernie and Jean Sue O’ Keefe, and learned a little more about this former teacher and coach. Bernie, who has many friends, taught some kind of creative writing class years ago at Bristol Central and one of his students was Adrian Wojnarowski, who is ESPN’s NBA basketball “Insider.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was getting to my car to leave the O’Keefes, their daughter, Paul O’Keefe, and son-in-law, Michael Cavalieri, pulled up next to my car and got out. With them was their daughter, Kazimiera “Emma” Cavalieri, a sophomore who competes in cross country, and both indoor and outdoor track at Bristol Central. Hello, Emma, it was nice to meet you!</p>

<p><strong>Tom Shopay</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I received a phone call from Tom Shopay the other day, and we enjoyed a great conversation. We plan to do this more often. Tom was a classmate of mine at Stafford School and Bristol Eastern.</p>

<p>Tom keeps busy with his kids and grandchildren who are in driving distance from him in the Sunshine State. He walks about four miles a day, and that includes stopping at a gym for 45 minutes of exercise. For those who don’t know, Tom played Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles.</p>

<p><strong>Another Bristol connection with UConn hoop</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just found out that Cam Spencer, a UConn men’s basketball senior, played for Steve Pikiell, who coaches the Rutgers men’s team. He is UConn’s second leading scorer this season, while tying for first for the Scarlet Knight last year with 13.2 per outing. Rutgers plays in the Big Ten Conference and the last time I looked they had a winning percentage of just over 50. Steve, by the way, was a two-time captain for UConn.</p>

<p><strong>New Street</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to research by Bob Adamczyk of the Bristol Historical Society, this street was named as such because it was a new street in the area at one time. First through Sixth Streets line up to New Street, and when it was developed, I’m thinking no one wanted to name it Seventh Street</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this in mind, and because a number of streets could be named New, I thought that I’d change the names of some roadways for your entertainment: First of all, I don’t like driving on Farmington Avenue and Middle Street. Middle Street could easily be called Race Street. Race Street could then be named something else. I have to work on Farmington Avenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goodwin Street could be named after “Music Man” Al and Jane Goodwin, Bernie Avenue could be for our Mr. O’Keefe who was talked about at the start of this column, and Bird Street could be named after the folks who operated the former Bristol Nurseries. Carol Denehy gets my nod for Carol Drive and the late Ronnie Davis fits well for Davis Drive. I’m working on a new name for Duncan Street even though there’s no Dunkin Donuts there.</p>

<p><strong>Bluebirds</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my friend Carolyn Perkins’ interests is bluebirds. While visiting Carolyn and her husband, Tim, last week I found out more about this feather-winged fowl. Carolyn has a camera set up and observes these birds daily. There are five bluebirds who come onto the outside deck in the back of their house on a daily basis. This is feeding time for them as Carolyn opens her sliding door and puts seed out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I found interesting was the fact that this pack hangs out together in colder weather when food isn’t readily available to them -- worms and other underground goodies aren’t popping their heads out in the cold. When the weather warms up, the one male and female couple among the five birds no longer hang out with their cold weather friends. They then keep to themselves.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
