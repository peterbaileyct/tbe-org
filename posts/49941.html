<p>One of Bristol High’s most talented athletes in the early 1950s was the late George Hemond, who would later coach scholastic football in Florida. George Redman, also deceased, knew George well in also being a standout “jock” at the Boulevard school, said "George is the best high school football coach in Florida.”</p>

<p>The family’s athletic traits also fell on Hemond’s son, Scott, who was a member of Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s in the late 1980s. Unfortunately, young Hemond picked up bad habits which led to a short professional career.</p>

<p>Former Bristol Press editor Bob Brown reminds me of the bearded white panelist of the daily ESPN sports show entitled, “Speak." Bob is older than the ESPN celebrity but looks somewhat like him. Both are intelligent and interesting to listen to. </p>

<p>Dave Helman is the fellow who reminds me of Bob Brown.</p>

<p>There are many thoughts as to who should be on the list of famous people from Bristol, Conn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would add Barbara H. Franklin, the 29th U.S. Secretary of Commerce. She is the widow of our beloved and late Wally Barnes and has resided here for decades. Who else has held such a prominent position? She is a friend.</p>

<p><strong>Burliington record</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until last week, Burlington, Conn., held the 24-hour rainfall total of 12.77 inches, the best in the state since records have been taken. The storm last weekend broke the 69-year-old mark set during the Flood of ‘55.</p>

<p><strong>LLWS -- Mary Lake</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two former Bristol residents that I know of now reside in Lake Mary, Fla., a team playing in the Little League World Series, and they are Liz and Dave Miceli. It must feel interesting for them to see the games at their former hometown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was thinking of all the changes here in past decades. Remember the water tanks near the boulevard? How we had pay telephones on walls. More grammar schools. More kids walking to school, not driving themselves or driving themselves. Respect for cops. Three channels for TV. The military air raid drills in the 1950’s. </p>

<p>At least we didn’t have to deal with COVID 19.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
