<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team opens the 2022 campaign on Saturday when Post 2 squares off against Tri-County in an exhibition contest from Muzzy Field at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the first of four straight games from home for the Bristol program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday, Post 2 squares off against Meriden to commence Zone 1 play - starting at 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Monday, it’s a third consecutive contest from Muzzy with Zone 1 foe West Hartford (5:45 p.m.) coming to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the home stand, it’s another showdown against Meriden - this time on Thursday at 5:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Expecting big things in 2022</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is not just looking for a Zone 1 title this season but a state championship by the completion of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2021 Connecticut champions, Avon, won’t be fielding a team in 2022 and a new squad will earn that crown this year - advancing to the Northeast Regional with a chance to qualify for the American Legion World Series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven teams currently make up Zone 1 this year, including Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is joined by Meriden, Naugatuck, Newington, Simsbury, and West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rejoining the Zone 1 fold on the Senior front is Torrington while the Avon team disbanded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>94 years and counting</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program is in its 94th season of American Legion baseball and is a multiple winner of Zone 1, Connecticut and Northeast Regional Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 won state championships in 1948 through 1951, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1974, 1983-84, 1997, 1997, 2004, and 2006 - looking to add to that impressive tally this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program tallied Northeast Regional titles in 1974, 1984, 1997, and 2008 - earning trips to the World Series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players from Bristol and surrounding towns were eligible to tryout for the squad from Post 2 this season as places such as Plainville and Farmington have not fielded Senior teams over the past few years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The areas Post 2 were able to draw from in 2022 included the towns of Wolcott, Thomaston, Terryville, Plymouth, Plainville and Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The state of Connecticut has five zones this season as several teams outside of Zone 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 linked up to form bigger and more competitive leagues around the state.</p>
