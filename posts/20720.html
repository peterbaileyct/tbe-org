<p>BRISTOL - Lorelei Stancavage, the tremendous catcher for the Bristol Central softball program, is one of the unsung players of the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The catcher’s position isn’t an easy one to play but when you find that special individual, half the battery on your team is already in good hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Stancavage gets to catch for two of the states best pitchers in the form of Sophia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto - two All-State pitchers who will be competing for NCAA Division I programs by the completion of the 2023 spring scholastic campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Stancavage has her collegiate future all mapped out as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She is going to an excellent Division II school to continue her softball education and on November 9, she signed the dotted line to take her talents to Southern Connecticut State University in a ceremony from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium - one of four players from the 2022 Class LL runner-up to sign her National Letter of Intent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That in itself is an amazing accomplishment for just one program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Owls are one of the teams that make up the Northeast-10 - a very competitive group of collegiate programs that will challenge Stancavage and the squad from Southern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Owls, who?” joked Wininger who was nearly booed out of the gymnasium for his ‘quick’ whit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Stancavage and her play is no joking matter as the senior is one of those quiet leaders who just simply grinds and grinds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s interesting to thing about Lorelei’s progression,” said Wininger. “If you’re not paying attention, she’s so quiet that you forget she’s doing her job every single day. And her job, arguably, is the toughest job on the diamond. The leadership that’s required of a catcher on a regular basis is incredibly important to the success of the team and Lorelei does it with some calm demeanor. She never gets rattled.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s always in control when she hits and it’s fun to watch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, Stancavage finally earned CCC South All-Conference honors as a junior and don’t surprised if the athlete earns the award over back-to-back campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Monica Hayes knows what it entails to be a talented catcher and Stancavage embodies all those characteristics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Catching is definitely one of the hardest things you can possibly do in any sport,” said Hayes. “Southern Connecticut is getting someone who is always working on her craft. And you’re always going to find her on a softball field or in a gym, in a batting cage, working to get better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s evident she’s put the time in to date as Stancavage is the perfect complement to her Division I duo in the circle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, in terms of actually catching, there isn’t much that slips by the senior standout in terms of wild pitches or passed balls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on the flip side at the plate, Stancavage continues to improve with the bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Central’s 6-1 triumph over Wolcott back on May 12, Stancavage was a slick 3-of-4 from the plate with five RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her bat can be a lethal weapon when the right pitch comes her way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s always, always working on her swing,” said Hayes. “She’s perfecting it, analyzing it, asking questions. She’s wants to stay at hitting stations more than others do and that’s not something you see every day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And she’s always asking questions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You always know what you’re going to get when Stancavage is behind the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a position Hayes doesn’t have to worry about with that seasoned pro is catching or belting out hits from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s consistent,” said Hayes of Stancavage. “You always know what you’re going to get and that’s one of the main themes of what I can say about her. Teammates know what they’re getting from her. You’re always on time, you stay after [practice], you help others on your team. You’re very honest and there’s no surprise in her performance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also spends time with the Connecticut Lightning 18U softball program and on the field, the senior can also play second base and man the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Hayes thinks of Stancavage of more than just a catcher or any ordinary softball player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget about the classroom component as Stancavage carries around a 4.00 Grade Point Average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She is a tremendous student athlete from Bristol Central that mirrors the best of what the school has to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s nobody that I’ve ever coached, nobody in this program like Lorelei,” said Hayes. “She’s different, she’s her own person and she has embraced that more and more.”</p>
