<p>The Bristol Eastern girls soccer squad scooped up a huge 0-0 tie against Berlin on Tuesday night in a CCC South engagement from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stalemate left the Kingstreeters at 0-1-1 on the season but the home-opening contest saw the locals put up a tremendous defensive fight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin moved to 1-0-1 overall and the program has yet to yield a goal this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keeper Abigale Pelletier did not allow the Redcoats to score, nabbing 13 saves while under fire for the full eighty minutes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This was a great result for Eastern,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Berlin had a slight advantage in the first half but were clearly frustrated by the way [we] came out and pressured them.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats took 28 shots overall but could not find pay dirt in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors did a quality job offensively over the second half and even with late corner kicks, Berlin could not put a dent on the scoreboard in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Berlin controlled most of the second half with many chances, but Pelletier played sensationally for the Lancers turning away countless chances,” said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Redcoats were awarded eight corner kicks with the Eastern defense - a tough senior crew - snuffing all those drives out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mother Nature had some input in the match, causing two delays that gave the showdown a late 7:05 p.m. start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t matter as Eastern, though tired and under pressure from two corner kicks that clanked off the crossbar over the final 10 minutes of play, held the fort to the end - snaring a huge tie against Berlin which could help the Lancers’ playoff chances down the road.</p>

<p>“We were gassed by the end of it,” said Redman. “Cecelia [Gilbert] played amazing at center back, bailing us out time and time again. [Taigan] Parent, [Julia] Armington, and Emily Piendak solidified the back line with Cece. The midfield [of Leah] Roy, [Emma] Stavens, [and Megan] Krok was gassed but up against talented players all night.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was really a great result for us and hopefully something we can build off.</p>

<p>The Lancers’ home stand continues on Thursday with a 6 p.m. CCC Interdivisional showdown against undefeated Tolland (2-0).</p>
