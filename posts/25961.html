<p>BRISTOL – Before the varsity baseball squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern commenced play on Friday night from Muzzy Field, the undercard was equally impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The JV squads from both schools went to work over a very entertaining affair and going into the seventh and final inning, the showdown was all knotted up at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took game-winning heroics by the Rams to seize ultimate victory, notching a run in the top of the seventh stanza, to seize a 3-2 win over the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams improved to 7-3 overall while the Lancers fell to 5-3 off the losing effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a very well-played affair, coming down to the wire while featuring tremendous pitching from both sides.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central's Jake Montana and Eastern's Jonny Montgomery each could have won the game, but the Rams were able to hold on late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montana earned a no-decision in the end while reliever Gavin Colvin, who came into pitch during the sixth inning, earned the victory for Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery took home the tough luck loss for the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central scored twice in the top of the first frame while Eastern answered with a couple runs during sixth inning play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams took over from the start as Alex Kuzniar led the first frame off with a single up the middle.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield error followed on a grounder off the bat of Mason Allan, putting runners on first and second.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocco Spirito then drove in both runners with a double to left center to propel Central to a 2-0 push.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Montgomery pitched extremely well over the next five frames, allowing just two singles to keep Central’s hot bats at bay.&nbsp;<br>On the flip side, Montana did not allow a hit over the first three frames, gave up singles in both the fourth and fifth but no further damage was done to keep Central ahead by a 2-0 push.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth inning, the Eastern offense started showing signs of life as Declan Schenck drilled a single but a grounder up the middle from Randy DeNoto turned into a 6-6-3 double play to erase the runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the fifth frame, it was more of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a single by Montgomery, a 6-4-3 double play stopped the Kingstreeters in their tracks and the 2-0 cushion was still being enjoyed by the Rams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But things changed quickly during sixth inning play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s&nbsp;Jason Rivard opened the stanza with a single up the middle and Jose Burgos followed with a double to left, putting runners on second and third with no one out.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off a strikeout, Adoni Fernandez singled up the middle to score both Eastern runners – tying the game at 2-2 with one inning left to play in regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central scored the final run of the affair during the fateful seventh stanza.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Montgomery still dealing from the mound, Central’s Adam Newton opened the seventh with an infield single and a pop-fly single to short right center by Kuzniar put runners on first and second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Newton scored the winning run on an infield error to help the Rams secure a 3-2 push.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery soon reached the pitch limit and was relieved by Anthony Nocera who generated the final out of the frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central reliever Gavin Colvin, who had come on during the sixth inning, struck out the Eastern side in the bottom of the seventh to secure the win for the Rams - winning the showdown by a 3-2 final.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
