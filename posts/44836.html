<p>Henryk lived a life filled with warmth, simplicity, and profound faith. He was a skilled butcher by trade, dedicating years of his life to the craft. After retiring from Atlantic Ventilation, Henryk embarked on countless adventures around the world alongside his beloved wife. They often traveled to Poland, mainly his hometown of Mieroszow and the town of Elk where they settled and started a family. Henryk was a man of simple pleasures. He found solace in the quiet tranquility of fishing, the thrill of mushroom gathering, and the beauty of bird watching.</p>

<p>One of Henryk's greatest joys in life was being surrounded by his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He loved telling them stories of his childhood and adventures. Their laughter filled his heart with warmth, and he cherished every moment spent with them. He always put his family first and worked tirelessly to ensure their well-being. </p>

<p>A true romantic at heart, Henryk loved nothing more than getting dressed up and dancing the night away with his beloved wife. Their love story was one of devotion and companionship. Though Henryk may no longer be with us in body, his spirit lives on in the memories we hold dear. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who had the privilege of knowing him.</p>
