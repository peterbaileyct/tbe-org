<p>Is there any slowing down the Bristol Central boys basketball program?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Probably not this year as the team won at Hartford Public, zipping up an 85-71 victory in Hartford to one to a perfect 12-0 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be tricked by the score as the final deficit was just 14 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was a laugher after three completed frames as the starters - including All-State talent Donovan Clingan - were on the bench, taking in the triumph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But here’s my problem with the showdown and games like it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public kept its starters in the entire contest, pressing, and trapping and cutting a huge deficit to 14 points in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do I have a problem with the defensive tactics?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, because you do what you must do at the end of a blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But why in the heck are these same programs keeping starters out on the floor long after these games are over?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a silly tactic, completely irresponsible and doing things like that will burn a team in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just ask the New England Patriots that when they left Rob Gronkowski out on the field during a 59-24 blowout against the Indianapolis Colts in 2012.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gronkowski ended up braking his left forearm blocking on a meaningless, fourth quarter extra point - derailing the Patriots postseason aspirations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why Central coach Tim Barrette pulls his starters once the game becomes out of reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Injuries are a real thing and Central has bigger plans in store than blowing Hartford Public out by fifty points - or more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette could do that, leave his prime-time players like Damion Glasper, Carson Rivoira, Steven Alseph, Victor Rosa, and Clingan on the court for 28-30 minutes-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Honestly, Clingan would average 40 points, 30 rebounds and 20 blocked shots a game if he went the distance - but the risk of a foolish, late game injury is too great.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But other programs around the state continue to use such tactics, pumping up the stats of players loooooong after games are out of reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s an easy way for a star player to get hurt and wreck the season in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For crying out loud, get your starters out when you can, develop your younger players, build your bench, and get the team to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good program can accomplish all those goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a bunch of Central Connecticut Conference coaches, among others,&nbsp; are doing the opposite and it makes little sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I guess you have to do what you have to do to push a player by inflating his (or her - this isn’t just a boys thing) statistics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In two of the Bristol Eastern’s boys last three games, opposing coaches have left starters in the game - long after the contest was decided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the program at Bloomfield was still pressing up fifty points with at least one starter still in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warhawks had just four players on the bench so that decision - and the tomfoolery that ensued - was made well before the jump-ball was even tossed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay, do what you have to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you think Lewis Mills head coach Ryan Raponey did the same in the Spartans 58-34 win over Eastern last Wednesday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, because Raponey is a good coach and a big picture guy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He would never even think of leaving starters in the game deep into a fourth quarter of a 24-point game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Platt did the opposite the other night at BE.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And let’s be frank: Coaches don’t forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you’re going to beat up on someone, and play ‘games’ like that, expect a receipt in the near future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What goes around comes around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I’m more concerned about our athletes and putting some of that talent in situations like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It isn’t a good idea on any level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Believe me, if a player is good enough, his play will get noticed by collegiate scouts.</p>
