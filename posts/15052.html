<p>The Bristol Blues of the New England Collegiate Baseball League have been the talk of the Western Division this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues were a sterling 24-8 overall entering its doubleheader in Massachusetts on Saturday afternoon and the only team with a winning record in the West plays over at Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second place Valley Blue Sox (15-19 overall) are 10 games in back of Bristol and the only other program with a better record than the locals in the league play is Vermont.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vermont Mountaineers carries an overall ledger of 26-6 but just posted a loss to the Blues on Friday night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been a busy stretch for Bristol over the past week and here’s a quick recap of all the action this week, starting with the Blues’ 6-1 triumph over Valley this past Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AJ Gaich walked three times for Bristol.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monday, July 11 – Bristol Blues 6, Upper Valley Nighthawks 5&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Errors fueled the final run as Ryan Wilson scored off a Derek Tenney single and a couple miscues in the field.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
