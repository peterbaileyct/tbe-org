<p>Bristol Central boys track and field stud Frankie Porrini, a tremendous athlete, absolutely destroyed the competition at the Nike Outdoor Nationals from the University of Oregon on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ending his junior year, Porrini placed fifth in the 2000 meter steeplechase - earning All-American status with a top-five finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a big deal and a tremendous accomplishment as one of Bristol’s own put themselves on the national map.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Francis Porrini III is an All-American!” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “He placed fifth in the 2k steeplechase at Nike Outdoor Nationals. The meet was at historic Hayward Field at the University of Oregon! The World Championships will be run here next month!”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini made the top finish of any athlete from the New England area in the challenge and was able to topple some serious competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended the race with a time of 6:03.42 - topping Ben Saelens from North Seattle, Washington by just 0.06 of a second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s an amazing ending to a historic day for Porrini and the program from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie ran an outstanding and smart race,” said Stafford-Kirk. “He was patient and it paid off. Our Bristol Central Track and Field family and the entire BC Ramily is so very proud of him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Benjamin Balazs of Portland, Oregon won the event from the Nike Outdoor Nationals with a finish of 5:47.14 while William Carlton (Decatur, Georgia) was the runner-up in 5:51.40.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In third place, Marcelo Parra (Texas) finished in 5:51.68 and Patrick Gibbons (North Carolina) took fourth in 5:58.38 before Porrini crossed the finish line.</p>

<p>“Bristol Central track and field, your coach is at a loss for words,” said Stafford-Kirk via Twitter. “Francis Porrini III is an All-American steeplechaser. He destroyed the school record, running [a] 6:03.42. This is an accomplishment we are all proud of. His team and village is always behind him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the season will continue for the talented Porrini along with Tre Blair this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie will run the 800 meters [on Sunday] here in Eugene,” said Stafford-Kirk. “Blair will triple jump at New Balance Outdoor National [on Sunday] morning.”</p>
