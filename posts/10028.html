<p>HARTFORD - I think I’m out of touch, folks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officially.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll explain myself with a specific example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sixth Annual GHPA High School Boys Basketball Classic last Saturday from Trinity College in Hartford proved that very fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I started to witness such a transformation about thirty years ago in the same city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was in high school, as my senior year at Bristol Eastern was about to begin, Hartford was awarded a basketball team in the Continental Basketball Association (since Hartford couldn’t land a real professional team) which was coined the Hartford Hellcats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The semi-pro team ended up playing its games at the Hartford Civic Center, once drawing the largest crowd in league history in the Hellcats’ 1993-94 opener.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team moved from Albany, New York and when the Hellcats came to Hartford, the squad was a popular draw - at first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magic Johnson even brought his traveling ‘All-Star’ team to the venue (I was in a Hellcats’ commercial high-fiving Magic as he came back to the bench) and for $6, you could get a good seat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But something strange happened when the jump-ball went up and was controlled by one of the teams: the music never stopped playing!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was wondering when the music was going to be shut off and when it never did, I was a bit annoyed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why was the music being played during the game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while I taped the Nationally Televised CBA games during that season - using a device called a Video Cassette Recorder - it was the same thing with the music and the like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just couldn’t get behind it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then fast-forward to the Doc Hurley Classic (a.k.a. the Sixth Annual GHPA High School Basketball Classic), last weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was ready to watch a good game between top-ranked Bristol Central and Southington from Trinity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the jump ball, when Central’s Donovan Clingan <em>easily </em>won the tap and the Rams controlled things, I noticed the DJ in the gymnasium playing music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the music never stopped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is nearly thirty years later, and the CBA model is being used at the high school level!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the announcer at the scorer’s table at Trinity, who did a very good job by the way, was commentating the game!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What tomfoolery was this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do we really need additional play-by-play watching Central’s Victor Rosa chucking the ball towards the rim for a Clingan alley-oop slam?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t the first time I saw this kind of set-up at the scholastic level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time I saw same situation, it was at an AAU all-star game at Trinity about five years ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was completely annoyed that day because Eastern’s Rod Jenkins - a very talented senior that scored over 400 points for the Lancers that season - was playing on one of the teams and when it was time to introduce him, no one knew his name or where he played.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I was already in a bit of a crazed state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was the music, a guy on the mic doing play-by-play and a ton of chatter between the baskets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just have to say, I can’t get behind this evolution of basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the question bears repeating: Am I out of touch?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does it mean I should call it a career, disappear into the night, and go do something else?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe I am the dinosaur here and it’s all my fault.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this the evolution of high school sports with an AAU flare?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcer from Trinity had some good one-liners when Central battled Southington:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Going up against a mountain” when a Southington player tried to body All-World center Donovan Clingan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You have to pay attention” after a turnover by Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He put jelly on that” on a good-looking reverse lay-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear lord, can’t I just watch the game in peace?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does the audience need to have every turnover spelled out?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do I need to stop shaking my fists and yelling at the clouds?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that last submission spelled everything out perfectly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when I go cover scholastic games, I use the same tools for nearly 25-something years when writing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I bring an oversized clipboard to every game, compile the stats, never carry a computer to write the event up (except for baseball), and I always physically score the game whether it’s football, basketball, or baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The art of traditional scorekeeping has also gone digital - breaking my heart in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see devices that will tally all the basketball statistics, on-line baseball journals, and advanced football stats tablets that do practically everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those devices make things easier but what’s the fun in that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give me a clipboard, a pencil, and just start the game - it’s as simple and easy as it gets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, I’ll just admit my fate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all that, I guess I am way out of touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just do me a favor…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If someone can run to their nearest pay phone or can leave Bradlees, Woolworth, or Caldor to help me, can I please have the phone number of the Video Galaxy on Stafford Ave? I need to catch up with that exciting, first season of the new TV show called ALF.</p>
