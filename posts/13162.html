<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central girls track and field team took care of business on Tuesday afternoon, dropping pesky Lewis Mills by an 83.3-65.7 final from BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final regular season home meet of the campaign for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Huge team effort today to defeat Lewis Mills,” said Central coach Kiara Bonilla-Jusino via Twitter. “So many personal records today but what was better was that competitive edge we displayed.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had wins up and down the line-up from the high jump to the 4x800 relay, won by the Rams in 11:38.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Agnerick Coreano did well in the field, taking both the shot put and discus events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coreano’s toss of 24 feet, five inches won her the shot put event while in the discus, her throw of 70 feet, five inches made her a dual victor on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 110 hurdles, Central’s Emily Blanchette earned first place in 18.5 seconds while Sophia Stark won a couple events along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stark was the victor in the 800 meters with a finish of 2:34 and in the mile challenge – the 1600 meters – she earned the victory in 6:02.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 3200 meters,&nbsp;Maura Waters won in 13:26 and in the triple jump, Destinee Craft’s leap of 35 feet was the winning mark.</p>

<p>To end the regular season, the Rams will travel across town to Alumni Field next Tuesday to battle Bristol Eastern.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is set for 3:45 p.m. and should be a very competitive bout against the Lancers.</p>
