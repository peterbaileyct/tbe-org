<p>Dozens of concertgoers filled Crystal Bees in Southington on Saturday night for the third annual Brian’s Angels summer fundraiser event, “Angelfest.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I started Brian’s Angels when I saw a young couple sleeping on a park bench on the boulevard,” said Executive Director Pat Stebbins. “I would walk around with my dog, and there were four feet sticking out of the park bench every morning. I was not thinking of my son at the time. I was not thinking of anything more than ‘How can I help them.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At the time, Bristol Talks was doing a little thing where everybody was paying it forward at Dunkin’ Donuts,” continued Stebbins. "I figured if someone was in line at Dunkin’ Donuts they had money to get coffee; and I had people who couldn’t afford to buy a bottle of water. So, I did a post on Bristol Talks and said, ‘Who wants to help pass out cold water?’ 54 people responded, and that was the beginning.”</p>

<p>The event opened with stand-up comedy from comedian Linda Belt followed by a high-energy musical performance from local favorites Someone You Can Xray and Jeff Summa and the Roasters. Both bands performed at the previous Brian’s Angels benefit in December 2022, and fans returned to hear their rock n’ roll sounds.</p>

<p>“I saw a flyer for this show a couple of weeks ago and recognized the Roasters and Xray from Bleachers,” said Greg Newsome. “Those guys were good and it’s important to support a good cause like Brian’s Angels.”</p>

<p>Throughout the evening, guests swayed to the up-tempo rhythm of the music and enjoyed food and beverages. Intricately decorated baskets and gift cards donated by local organizations were raffled off to patrons.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amongst the lively crowd of concertgoers was former Brian’s Angels client and 2019 Bristol Boys and Girls Club Youth of the Year Stanley Cardona.</p>

<p>“Pat was there in my time of need; she’s done so much for me,” said Cardona. “I grew up in New York City, and I spent years in and out of homeless shelters. When my family came to Bristol in 2015, Pat and Brian’s Angels gave us warm meals, water, a place to cool off in summer, warm up in winter, whatever we needed to get through the day. When I first met Pat, I was a sophomore in high school, and I just graduated from Trinity College with a degree in economics. I’m going back there in the spring to get my masters.”</p>

<p>The evening closed with a set from nationally renowned guitarist Jeff Pevar, who has toured the world with numerous musicians, including David Crosby, Joe Cocker and Phil Lesh and Friends. The 2016 NY Blues Hall of Fame inductee captivated the audience with his unique blend of R&amp;B, Pop, Funk, Blues and Rock.</p>

<p>“I’m having a blast,” said Stebbins. “Everyone has been great. I’m so thankful for all of the acts who took the time to help us out, thankful for all our volunteers and everyone who came here tonight. We couldn’t do this without their support.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
