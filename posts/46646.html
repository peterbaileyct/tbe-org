<p>To the editor,</p>

<p>Once again, I'm asking those who can to be generous. We are #BristolAllHeart. Each year, I write the "zucchini letter." It's been close to 30 years since I was made aware of the needs of our shelters, food pantries and soup kitchens during the summertime. If you have a garden, you can bring extra produce to the places listed below as they suggest. If you don't have extra produce in your garden, you can buy some and drop it off OR see the lists below with other suggestions for paper goods, gift cards, etc. If you know someone else who can help, please pass this on! </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
