<p>All residents of the state will be eligible to receive savings on certain prescription drugs when the state's prescription drug discount card program begins on Oct. 2. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program, established by a provision of Gov. Ned Lamont’s <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2023/06-2023/Governor-Lamont-Signs-Legislation-on-Health-Care-Affordability">health care affordability bill</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Public+Act&amp;which_year=2023&amp;bill_num=171" target="_blank">Public Act 23-171</a>) approved by the General Assembly and signed into law in June, is administered by the Office of the State Comptroller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut residents who want to receive an ArrayRx discount card can fill out the form that is available online at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arrayrxcard.com/" target="_blank">arrayrxcard.com</a>. A valid physical Connecticut address and e-mail address are required to enroll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The card will be provided to consumers digitally via e-mail and can be downloaded to smartphone wallets. It is anticipated that the card can be used at approximately 98 percent of pharmacies in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rising costs make accessing health coverage a barrier for far too many people, and entering Connecticut into this multi-state consortium is a way to provide the residents of our state some savings on the medications they need to stay healthy,” Lamont said in a release from his office announcing the launch. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the direction of Comptroller Sean Scanlon, Connecticut has entered into the multi-state consortium known as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://arrayrxcard.com/" target="_blank">ArrayRx</a>, which also operates in Nevada, Oregon and Washington. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Connecticut, the discount card is available for free. When purchasing prescription drugs, residents present the card at their pharmacy and they can receive savings of up to 80 percent on certain medications. All FDA-approved drugs are eligible for a discount.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some examples of savings using the ArrayRx discount card on commonly filled prescription drugs in participating states include:</p>
