<p>BRISTOL - After an excellent second-half finish by the Bristol Eastern baseball team in 2021, the program is back to work this year - having graduated nearly a dozen seniors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second year coach Steve Gaudet is ready for more but will have to go into battle with several pitchers lean on varsity experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers are looking for another state tournament berth this season and here’s how Eastern shapes up in 2022:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Steve Gaudet (2nd season, 7-14 overall) &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 season</strong>: Earned the 29th seed in the Class L fray and gave No. 4 Woodstock a heck of scare. Woodstock snuck by the Lancers, 3-1, in first round play. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key</strong> <strong>Losses</strong>: Dylan Woodsome (OF), Tyler Martin (2B/P), Andrew Lozier (P/INF), Brayden Moore (P), Ryan Fradette (OF), Trevor Nohilly (OF), Tyler Stickles (INF), Logan Schenck (P), Nate Ouellette (1B/C), Alexander Canzellarini (P). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Roster</strong>: Rio Fernandez (so, C), Jose Feliciano (jr, 1B), Isaac Roberge (1B), Owen Myers (fr, 1B), Elliot Norris (sr, 2B/P), Cole Latko (sr, SS), Ryan Maglio (jr, 3B/P), Anthony Nocera (fr, 3B/P),&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben D’Amato (so, LF/P), Jaydon Churchill (sr, CF/P), Conor Cyr (jr, CF), Connor McCormick (sr, RF/P), Mike Roalf (jr, P), Caleb Molinsky (so, P), Noah Gatti (fr, P), Kyle Babin (jr), Preston Guarda (so, INF).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Season Outlook</strong>: Eastern lost a core group of seniors and the pitching rotation took a bit of a hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means spots all over the field are going to be filled by a youthful group of players eager to earn a little varsity time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group should be able to put the ball into play on a nightly basis, playing well in preseason with that young crew.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have very limited experience, but I love what I have seen at the plate and in the field this preseason,” said Gaudet. “[A] majority of the lineup will be playing varsity for the first time this year.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has several pitching arms at its disposal but, just like the rest of the squad, is looking to get experience as the season pushes on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Jaydon Churchill (centerfield) returns to the hill, throwing just short of 37 innings in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 2-3 overall and carried a solid 3.44 ERA, co-leading the squad in strikeouts with 23.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a couple of those losses came due to the lack of run support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill will be joined on the mound by seniors Elliot Norris (second base) and Conor McCormick (right field), juniors Ryan Maglio (third base) and Mike Roalf, who each spent a little time on the hill last season, sophomores Caleb Molinsky, Ben D’Amato (left field), and Noah Gatti, and freshman Anthony Nocera (third base). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, the group will be getting experience on the fly.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Our] pitching is very inexperienced,” said Gaudet, “but will improve as they gain experience and confidence.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the plate, Churchill was second on the Lancers in at-bats, posting a .242 average which included 15 hits, three RBI, and seven walks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He led the squad with 14 stolen bases and was hit by a pitch a team-leading six times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato, who plays in the outfield, saw plenty of time at the plate last season - posting a .232 batting average to go along with 13 hits, nine walks and 13 RBI.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And senior shortstop Cole Latko nearly had 30 at-bats last season and managed to scoop up five hits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Churchill, Latko, and D'Amato are the only true varsity returners,” said Gaudet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others that will contribute this season include sophomore Rio Fernandez (catcher), junior Jose Feliciano (first base), junior Isaac Roberge (first base), freshman Owen Myers (first base), and junior Conor Cyr, who will play centerfield when Churchill is on the mound. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Kyle Babin could also see time on the field as will sophomore Preston Guarda (third base) who is still dealing with an injury sustained during the winter sports season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s certainly a different take after last year’s senior-filled roster but Gaudet should have enough to make a postseason appearance by the time the end of May rolls around.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CCC South Outlook: </strong>The Lancers will be challenged by the squad across the city over at Bristol Central while Maloney always brings a tough team to the diamond.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin will also be a top contender to tangle with once again after a deep state tournament run in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In the CCC South, Bristol Central has a ton of big arms and has one of the best players in the state in JT Clark,” said Gaudet. “Berlin and Maloney are very talented and will be at the top with Bristol Central.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule: </strong>Eastern starts the season on the road Wednesday against Plainville (3:45 p.m., weather permitting) and then travels to Lewis Mills in Burlington on Friday, also at 3:45 p.m., before finally getting a chance to play at game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers open its home portion of the 2022 campaign against Berlin (3:45 p.m.) from Clem J. Roy Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next four games are on the road before ending the month of April with a little home cooking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney comes to town on April 27, Northwest Catholic follows up on Friday (April 29) and then to open May, it’s Eastern/Central Part One (May 2).&nbsp;</p>
