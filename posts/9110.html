<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SIMSBURY - The Bristol Eastern volleyball team is your 2021 Central Connecticut Conference Volleyball Tournament champions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the No. 7 ranked Lancers earned every accolade along the way, securing the title in a 3-1 victory over No. 9 Simsbury on Saturday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores from the contest played at Simsbury high school were 24-26, 25-17, 25-20, and 25-18 as Eastern (18-5) plowed through all the competition, going 4-0 over a whirlwind week of matches to snare the title against the best squads in all the CCC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels so amazing,” said Eastern’s Alex Shorette of the title win. “Like I’m speechless right now. It’s such an unexplainable feeling. There’s so many tears of joy.&nbsp; This team, we just worked so hard and deserve this win. It just so amazing to be able to say that we did it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hannah Webber was the star of the show once again, kicking in 33&nbsp;kills and two digs to lead her squad to the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not a one player show at Eastern and it wasn’t on Saturday either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Bender notched one her of slick double-doubles (15&nbsp;kills, 13&nbsp;digs) over another huge winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette, a jack of all trades athlete, ramped up 16&nbsp;digs, four&nbsp;aces, two kills, three assists as she filled the stat sheet with a little bit of everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Adorno’s serving caused problems again with four&nbsp;aces to go along with seven digs while Sarah Lacouture bumped up&nbsp;eight digs. Abby Jones had a tremendous showing as Eastern’s floor general with 42&nbsp;assists while Jayna Hatcher, Lilli Lowe and Adrianna Reay all contributed over the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But freshman Emily Valentine’s serving over the last two sets changed the course of the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She flashed in four aces when Eastern needed it the most.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She did exactly what I asked her to do,” said Reay of Valentine. “She’s just a freshman. I mean, she stepped in there and took over for Hannah’s serves and she didn’t just hit it over and in. She was a force.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She did a fantastic job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury nabbed an early 6-3 edge in set one and eventually pushed it to 9-5 via a clean ace by Simsbury’s Cara Hodgson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern went on a 10-3 burst to snare a 15-12 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the set, Webber unleashed a kill that dropped in right on the sideline and when a Shorette swing grazed the net and fell over cleanly, it was an 18-13 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, an 8-2 Trojans run was fueled by Eastern miscues as the visitors led 21-20 late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers stormed back to nab a two-point lead (23-21) but Simsbury closed out game via a 5-1 run - winning 26-24 to take its only set of the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[Simsbury] played some fantastic defense,” said Reay. “They had some great swings. And the girls just took a couple deep breaths and [we] played our game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In set two, the Trojans ran out to an early lead but a sweet ace by Shorette, which skimmed the net and fell in, posted the Kingstreeters to an 11-8 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That lead ballooned to 18-12 when Webber slipped in another sideline kill and then blocked a shot for a point as the Lancers were starting to run away with the set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three straight aces by Jones and a slick play from Lilli Lowe eventually made it a double-figure affair.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury refused to yield, netting five straight points to trim the deficit to 22-17 as the Lancers called for time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber then made it academic moments later as her ace, coupled with a Trojans’ hitting error, saw Eastern take the second set 25-17, squaring the contest up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next game started with the Lancers in front 4-2 off a crushed rebound by Webber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 7-1 burst by Trojans run made it a 9-5 game and off the power of serves by Shorette, Eastern eventually made its run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers built up a 15-12 edge, lost all of it via an 8-2 Simsbury burst and it was a 19-18 game - in the Trojans’ favor - before Valentine took over the serving duties for Webber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the match came to a screeching halt for Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valentine flipped in ace after ace and by the time the Trojans finally tallied a point, the Lancers were about to close things out - leading 24-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She was put in, she did her job, and she did it so well,” said Shorette of Valentine. “I’m so proud of her. She’s a freshman and she did her job completely well, no nerves. I mean we just couldn’t ask anything more of her. She did just a great job between getting the aces and getting a pass in to get a kill or something like that. She just did amazing.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when one final Simsbury serve crashed into the net, the Lancers won set three, 25-20 - going in front two games to one in match play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set four saw Eastern slowly build its advantage and when a Webber kill was tipped by Simsbury on its way out of bounds, the squad was in charge at 11-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Trojans chopped the deficit to two, Adorno hit the service line, flipped in a few aces, as the Kingstreeters were running away with it at 17-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lead was 21-12 late but Simsbury made one last push, getting a couple net aces to trim the deficit to 23-18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Webber ended the event with consecutive kills as Eastern ramped up a 25-18 victory to take the match, 3-1, as the Lancers earned the 2021 CCC volleyball tournament championship.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And going into the Class L state tournament play this coming week, the Lancers got to play some prime time programs and are enjoying a wave of momentum heading into the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We fought against some fantastic opponents and it’s been some really great volleyball,” said Reay. “Tonight is absolutely no exception. And the girls and I always talk about the fact that every match and every practice, we’re looking to improve just a little bit and this was a great opportunity to do just that.”</p>
