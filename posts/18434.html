<p>The outpouring of love was evident as hundreds of people joined Bristol police, firefighters and emergency responders along with police cruisers representing many of the towns in the state, who showed up to pay their respects for their fallen brothers, at the Friday night's vigil on North Main Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A police cruiser showered with flowers, cards, balloons, letters and candles stood silently by a memorial to the late Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte, 35, and the late Officer Alex Hamzy, 34, as well as Officer Alec Iurato, 26, who was severely injured and still recovering.</p>

<p>Local resident Jamie Perchiano, 49, organized the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I gave back what's been given to me which is another chance at life,” said Perchiano. “I'm a recovering alcoholic and Sgt. Demonte helped me get sober, and ever since I've gotten sober, I wanted to give back to the community.”</p>

<p>Toward that end, Perchiano has become a volunteer for many concerns, especially, helping the homeless, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm happy that I was able to do this kind of organization just for the support of the officers and their families,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The media presence was represented by all the national and local news organizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officers in their cruisers, a fire engine with its ladder carrying the American flag along with emergency responders paraded one by one, pass the those gathered in front of the Police Department and down the street.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening, individuals and groups of people stood in front of the memorial cruiser, paying their respects. There were no speeches during the vigil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People from all walks of life with their families and pets gathered to show support for the fallen officers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were tears, hugs and quiet conversations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One family donned clothing with the U.S. Navy logos as a show of solidarity between those in the armed forces and the police on our streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dave Higgins, 61, spent all his deployments in the Middle East, Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Iraqi Liberation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s to support our community, U.S. veterans, we supported the country,” said Higgins as his voice broke. “We're all brothers and sisters in a way and this was just senseless to happen to two of our brothers in a community like this. It's unthinkable.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He talked about his interactions with Officer Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He's been to the house a couple of times on some routine calls that we would call them on and just be the nicest people,” he said. “For them to have their life cut short and their family, I can’t image.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the crowd dispersed, Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano shared a final remembrance with me about Officer Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Officer Hamzy helped carry the torch for the Special Olympics,” said Cagginao. “It’s something not many people know about him.”</p>

<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
