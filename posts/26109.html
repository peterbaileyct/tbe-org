<p>Bristolâ€™s Zoning Commission unanimously approved in a 5-0 vote on Monday a proposal to construct 74 housing units for persons 55 and older on Camp Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Renderings of the project, located on six acres adjacent to the Gloria Dei Church, show considerable landscaping, a boulevard entrance parallel to Overlook Drive on Plainville side of Camp Street, a walking path, a garden, a patio, a rooftop patio area and a gazebo.</p>

<p>The commissioners, along with city engineers and some concerned citizens, raised questions about flooding, traffic, the height of the building and parking, but they were mostly addressed prior to the meeting. Those which were not resolved were left to further review, as part of the process, with an opportunity to be addressed on an as needed basis.</p>

<p>The development by Eastwood Meadows, which is owned and operated by Joseph Naples III, will be three stories and have 82 total parking spaces, which includes eight for guest parking.</p>

<p>Some neighbors in the Mountain View and Sherman Park area who initially were against the project eventually came to support it. Thirty-seven letters, many conforming to a form letter in support of the development, signed by residents in the area adjacent to and surrounding the project, were provided by Timothy W. Furey, the Eastwood Meadows attorney. </p>

<p>To accommodate the development, slightly more than six acres of forest, the last of that size on that end of town, will be removed.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
