<p>Two individuals running a suspected prostitution operation out of a Farmington Avenue address in Bristol have been arrested.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vincent Whiteley and David Henderson, the individuals controlling the business, "Aqua After Dark," are each being held on $250,000 surety bonds, according to a release earlier this morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The arrests came yesterday, Wednesday, Oct. 9, when the Bristol Police Department Narcotics Enforcement Team, working with the Statewide Organized Crime Investigative Task Force, located and arrested the individuals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whitely was charged with conspiracy at trafficking persons and conspiracy at promoting prostitution in the second degree. Henderson was charged with conspiracy at promoting prostitution in the second degree, conspiracy at trafficking in persons, permitting prostitution and trafficking in persons.</p>

<p>The investigation began in January, earlier this year, when the Bristol Police Dept. received complaints about the business at 1235 Farmington Ave.</p>

<p>In its release, the Bristol Police Dept. thanks the state's investigative task force and stated its commitment to combat illegal prostitution within the city.</p>

<p>Toward that end, it encouraged citizens to reach out via its voicemail and email systems which ensure anonymity.</p>
