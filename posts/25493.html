<p>St. Paul continued its impressive run through the NVL with a 10-0 whitewash of Wolcott, with senior pitcher Jamie Leggett tossing another gem, leading his team to victory Friday afternoon in Bristol. Leggett pitched the entire game (5 innings) for St. Paul, allowing Wolcott only two infield singles while striking out six.</p>

<p>Starter Nate Yachtis took the loss for Wolcott.</p>

<p>After Leggett retired the side in order to start the game, the St. Paul offense got to work right away in the bottom of the 1st inning. Logan Rembish led off with a double off the left field fence. Rembish advanced to 3rd on a wild pitch, and Leggett singled Rembish home for the first run of the game. Walks to Devin Kulas and Cal Chance loaded the bases with no outs. Cole Raymond singled home Leggett, and Ryan Kilpatrick singled home Kulas and Chance to make it 4-0.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 2nd, Leggett led off with a single. Yachtis had him picked off, but in the ensuing rundown, the ball was thrown away allowing Leggett to reach second base safely. That turned out to be a very costly error. Kulas singled driving in Leggett. And with two outs, Jonathan Remillard doubled home Kulas and Chance. That gave St Paul three unearned runs in the inning, and a 7-0 lead.</p>

<p>St Paul tacked on one more run in the bottom of the 3rd inning without getting a base hit. Leggett led off with a walk, and then advanced ninety feet on each of 3 wild pitches.</p>

<p>Ahead 8-0, St Paul needed two runs in the 5th to take advantage of the ten run mercy rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcottâ€™s Nate Ehmer got a strikeout to retire the first batter, but then hit Kulas with a pitch to put a man on. Back-to-back singles to Chance and Raymond loaded the bases with one out. Kilpatrick delivered an RBI single to make it 9-0. Ehmer won a nine pitch battle to record his second strikeout of the inning. Then AJ Corrado got the walk off RBI in a painful way - he was hit by a pitch, and the game was over.</p>
