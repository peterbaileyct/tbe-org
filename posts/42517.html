<p>The three of them lean in over the cake, which celebrates their years of friendship, beginning shortly after the conclusion of World War II, when they came together for a wedding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There is a picture in the photo album that we brought, and it shows the three of them what they look like when they were 20 years old," said Neal Supranovich, American Legion Post 2 historian and emcee of the Iwo Jima/World War II veterans reunion held at the Bristol Public Library last Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of the three, Joe Caminiti and Dick Fitz, were in the third's, John Fensick's, wedding over 70 years ago.  They were joined last Sunday for the reunion by two other World War II veterans, Jim Cleveland and Tony DeAngelo. The youngest is 98. Caminiti will celebrate his 100th birthday this October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"These three gentlemen here hit off their friendship after World War II," Supranovich said. "They have been friends ever since. They have taken part in many events to honor World War II veterans and other veterans in town."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The occasion brought together five World War II veterans for a ceremony that included an address by Don Scott, who is painting portraits of veterans and a presentation of a complete list of members of C Company 169 comprised of Bristol soldiers who fought in World War II.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from the cake cutting ceremony, the event included the presentation of proclamations from a U.S. Congressman and Bristol's state legislators, a birthday card presentation and reading of Connecticut servicemen who died on Iwo Jima.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Full disclosure," Scott said at the beginning of his talk. "I'm not a historian, don't play one on TV," adding that "I'm just this guy who watches too many World War II documentaries."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His talk covered the contributions of the Navajo Code Talkers, of one whom, Thomas Begay, is the subject to his latest painting. Scott has taken on the task of painting portraits of all remaining World War II veterans. He has painted Caminiti's portrait and has professional grade prints made for display. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prints of Caminiti's portrait are on display at the Memorial Military Museum at its Bristol Historical Society location as well as outside the Bristol History Room at the Bristol Public Library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scott's portrait of Thomas Begay, one of the code talkers who turned 101 last year, was among the portraits on display during the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Code talkers, they were nothing new," he said. "They've been used in World War I. The Choctaw were employed by the U.S. Army."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He covered the significance of Iwo Jima, and its critical position in the Pacific, as a fueling depot for an invasion of Japan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recreating the battle on Iwo Jima, he recounted the strategy of the Japanese forces, which lulled U.S. troops into a false sense of security upon their first assault and estimated that as one point Begay and Caminiti might have crossed paths as they were both in the 10th wave of American forces to storm the beaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After his talk, the cake cutting took place as well as presentations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vietnam veteran John Lodovico spoke about the friendship between his father and Caminiti, both veterans.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>'They were best friends," Lodovico said about his father and Caminiti. "The day I was born Joe went to the hospital with my father."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lodovico donated the funds for the framing of Caminiti's portrait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Looking at these pictures here is walking living history that we have, that we necessarily may lose," Lodovico said, referring to Scott's portraits. 'We'll never lose it in Bristol. Joe's picture is hanging on the second floor by the microfiche machine. And it's going to be there well after I hope another one hundred years or well after we are gone." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chad Layton of the Bristol Elks and Joe Martinez of the Elks Veterans Committee presented Caminiti with a a copy of "The Connecticut Military Heroes: The Battle Iwo Jima," to honor his years of service.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The year of Pearl Harbor," Supranovich said, "a group from Bristol here was federalized and sent to Florida and began training. On Pearl Harbor, they were activated and brought into the actual army. There is no record in the city of Bristol of these individuals because they are listed as active personnel. All the records of them being National Guardsmen Charlie Company 169 of Bristol was erased."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 reduplicated the initial federalization orders and presented the list to the Bristol Public Library for the Bristol Room, Supranovich said.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were displays by the World War II Legacy Foundation and the Memorial Military Museum. Gary and Marianne Roy, of the foundation, presented birthday cards to the veterans. Aaron Elson, an oral historian, was also present. Elson features interviews with veterans on his podcast: <a href="http://myfatherstankbattalion.com.">myfatherstankbattalion.com.</a></p>
