<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern boys track and field team won its third consecutive meet on Tuesday, this time passing the test against Middletown by a 78-71 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After starting the season at 0-2, the Kingstreeters have been putting together a tremendous streak, including hanging a loss on an always competitive Blue Dragon’s program.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of Eastern’s three relay teams won the day as the 4x400 and 4x800 teams performed well.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the 4x800 relay, Brendan Tartarelli, Aidan Gezelman, Carlos Portillo, and Jed Liu were the victors in 11:21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an individual front, the Lancers had first place winners up and down the roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joshua Moore seized the 110 hurdles (18.01 seconds) and long jump (16 feet, 6.75 inches) events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Logan Crowley took the 1600 meters in under five minutes (4:49) and won the 3200 meters in 10:40.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Mulcunry zipped up a time of 53.9 seconds in the 400 meters while teammate Gabriel Nugra placed first in the 300 hurdles (50.32 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with his win in the 4x400 relay, Harris took the 800 meters (2:04.7) and pole vault (10 feet) events and in the triple jump, Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum’s successful make of 38 feet and a half inch was the winning mark.</p>
