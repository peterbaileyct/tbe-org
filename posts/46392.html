<p>Coby Dagata led the St. Paul Falcons to a 3-1 win over the St. Bernard Saints in a second-round game of the Class S Baseball State Tournament in Montville Wednesday afternoon. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dagata pitched the entire game and allowed only one run on four hits while striking out six. Martin Light also pitched a complete game for the Saints scattering nine hits and allowing only two earned runs while striking out 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was evident from the start that this was going to be a pitcher's duel. Both Dagata and Light held the opposition scoreless over the first three innings, each allowing only two singles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul was the first to break through scoring one run in the top of the fourth inning. Catcher Cal Chance led off with a single, and advanced to third base when Dagata singled behind him. Logan Rembish followed with an RBI single scoring Chance, and St. Paul led 1-0.</p>

<p>After Dagata retired the St. Bernard hitters in order in the bottom of the fourth, St. Paul added two more runs in the top of the fifth. With one out Arden Polverari singled to right and was replaced by pinch runner Nate Cravanzola. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keaton Kroll followed with a long single to right, and Cravanzola tried to score. On the play, the ball was thrown away allowing Cravanzola to score and Kroll to advance to third. Then Jay DeRosa got down a perfect bunt to bring home Kroll, and St. Paul led 3-0.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But St. Paul's lead was in jeopardy in the bottom of the fifth. Joey Muscarella led off with a walk. Light followed with a single putting two men on. Then Colin O'Leary singled driving in the first run for St. Bernard, and advanced to second on the throw in from the outfield. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With men on second and third with no outs, things were not looking good for St. Paul. But that's when Dagata bore down and struck out the next three batters to end the threat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the exception of Kevin Poeschl, who reached on an infield error, Dagata retired every batter to face him over the remaining two innings to earn the win.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
