<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew again! Last week’s Heracross event was awesome! I made over 30 new connections with this event, and everyone I met were super cool! Bristol has such a great community for players, and they battle like veterans. Now, let’s talk about the new Pokémon popping up in the gyms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tapu Bulu came out recently, and it’s a Pokemon every trainer should have in their collection. Tapu Bulu does come in as a shiny form, and it’s pretty easy to take down. As a fairy and grass type Pokémon, poison type Pokémon will be able to beat this one with ease. Sludge Bomb is the move of choice here, dealing massive damage during this raid battle. Any of the following types would do well against: fire, flying, ice, poison, and steel. Check out the local spots below to find it:</p>

<p>Community Bellsprout Day is coming this week! It’s starts on April 20. You can catch the Flower Pokémon and the shiny form too! It’s from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. I will be doing this event over in Rockwell Park, so if you are there, you can meet me in person! During this time, you can teach it Magical Leaf, a super effective grass type move for this Pokémon. </p>

<p>The Global GO fest is on July, 13 and 14, and many towns are doing special events to celebrate. There will be an update soon regarding the event I will help put together for the first GO experience here.<br>Be sure to gear up for next week, where we prepare for the next World of Wonders event!

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
