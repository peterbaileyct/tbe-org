<p>Justin Malley, Bristol’s Economic Development director, last Tuesday afternoon provided a brief update on the progress of developments downtown, on Riverside Avenue and on Farmington Avenue. Below is a quick summary of what is and will not be happening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Wheeler building and the first Carrier apartment building at Centre Square are proceeding on schedule. The plans call for four restaurant sites on the first floor of the two Carrier buildings that should help bring traffic to the area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sessions Building on Riverside Avenue recently went through the necessary environmental cleanup that was needed for it to be developed. The city is hoping that a developer will convert the building into apartments that are available as workforce housing, targeting households that earn between 60 percent and 120 percent of the area’s median income.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an RFP (Request for Proposals) for the Sessions building, a significant number of potential developers walked through the structure last weekend, and the city is hoping to receive proposals from some of them soon. (The original developer is no longer involved.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plans are also in place for a significant upgrade of Riverside Avenue itself, making it more attractive and suitable as a gateway to downtown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Rt. 6, the city has been busy marketing the tract of land that used to be Larson’s farm, just beyond Wendy’s heading toward Farmington. One of the snags has been the need for a traffic light for cars that would exit the potential plaza, but the state has jurisdiction over traffic decisions on Rt. 6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The developer has a commitment for a fast-food restaurant (which cannot be named yet) and a car wash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And last, but certainly not least, here is the latest on Dairy Queen. The franchisee who bought the property is still quiet about what is happening (or not happening). </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A more personal take on DQ</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This reporter apologizes to all Dairy Queen lovers who read TBE. I got you excited for a DQ grand opening, a vision of Blizzards dancing in your head- and nothing has happened. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BUT, as long as it sits there empty, the lot still belongs to a Dairy Queen franchisee. Maybe he or she is saving up one dollar at a time to accumulate the cash necessary to get it going.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, to paraphrase Jim Carrey in “Dumb and Dumber,” You’re saying we have a chance? Yes, we still have a chance, boys and girls.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
