<p>The Joint Board meeting starts at 6:45 p.m. The City Council meeting follows immediately.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the items that the City Council will consider is the final report of the Charter Revision Commission.  The draft report came before the council earlier, and the council voted to remove a recommendation that would expand both the city council and the finance board as a way to ensure multiparty representation on the council. Charter Revision Commission recommendations are included on each ballot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The commission in turn voted to leave the recommendation in its final report. The City Council will vote on the final report this evening.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access five (5) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have no limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
