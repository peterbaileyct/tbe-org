<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball team finally made its 2022 debut on Monday and opened against a hungry squad from Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs were looking for its first victory of the campaign and the Redcoats were able to tally that win - posting a 5-0 victory over the Lancers from Clem J. Roy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin improved to 1-3 overall while Eastern fell to 0-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats’ Harrison Lombardi threw a complete game gem for the visiting aggression, earning the seven-inning shutout for his team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just three hits - all of the single variety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ben D’Amato drilled a single to left center, Cole Latko snuck out a swinging bunt single in the fourth, and Elliot Norris followed suit with one in the sixth stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lombardi was tough to solve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He fanned eight while walking three to earn the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers allowed just one run over the first four innings and still trailed by that same score going into the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin notched its run in the top of the first off Eastern starter Mike Roalf. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jamie Palmese opened the contest by blasting a single between third and short, then stole second and third - eventually scoring on a groundout to make it a 1-0 game. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fifth, Roalf was still working hard on the mound, but the Redcoats padded its lead with four runs to take a 5-0 lead. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin’s Ryan Hines opened the inning with a double to right which was followed by a home run from Kasey Ouellette as his drive over the fence in right made it a 3-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Kyle Hyde and Will Gomes dropped in singles and Toby Lavender doubled to left center, scoring Hyde, as the Redcoats led it 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Caleb Molinsky came on to relieve Roalf and Gomes scored the final run on a passed ball as Eastern absorbed a tough 5-0 setback to open the 2021-22 campaign.</p>

<p>Eastern’s wacky schedule sees the squad on the road over its next six games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just under two weeks, the Lancers travel to Tolland (April 13), Plainville (April 15), New Britain (April 20), Northwest Catholic (April 22), Lewis Mills of Burlington (April 23), and Platt (April 25) over a tough slate of games.</p>

<p>Eastern is finally back home at Clem J. Roy Field on Wednesday, April 27 against Maloney.</p>
