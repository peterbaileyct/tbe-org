<p>The Bristol Central girls lacrosse team was in a back-and-forth battle against Wethersfield this past Monday, needing overtime to determine the ultimate winner in a CCC South showdown from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Eagles snared the game-winner late as the Rams fell in the end, 12-11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central dropped to 3-2 overall on the campaign but have won two of their past three matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams made one heck of a comeback, down 11-4 at one point of the bout – scoring seven straight goals to force the extra session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield won for the second time this season.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Central, Kaylynn LaPointe flipped in six goals to lead the offensive onslaught for the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rachel Wygant added two goals while Emily Lowe, Emma Burciaga and Ava Bouchard all tallied a goal over the comeback effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Amy Pelletier made a dozen saves to keep Central in contention until the final goal was tallied by the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is back in action this Friday at 4 p.m. when Edwin O. Smith travels to Bristol for a CCC interdivisional match from the turf field at BCHS.</p>

<p>And next Tuesday, it’s Bristol Central squaring off against Bristol Eastern from Alumni Field at 7 p.m. under the lights.</p>
