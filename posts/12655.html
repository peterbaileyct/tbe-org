<p>BURLINGTON - Trailing by a run going into the bottom of the sixth against Bristol Eastern, the Lewis Mills baseball team scored four times - rallying to defeat the Lancers by a 7-5 final in Burlington on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills moved to 4-3 on the season while Eastern fell to 2-4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth stanza, Eastern was leading 4-3 before the Spartans made its game-ending run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills’ Jayden Longdin opened the inning with an infield single to third off Eastern starter Ryan Maglio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a walk, Cam Fisher reached on another infield single, this one deflecting off the pitching rubber into the air to second baseman Elliot Norris, who cold not make a play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, the bases were loaded.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio walked the next batter to force in a run, tying the showdown at 4-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill came in and relieved Maglio but the Spartans kept the pressure on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An RBI walk, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Noah Moriarty, and a double to left by Alec Varano led to three runs and put Lewis Mills on top, 7-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would be a deficit too much for the Lancers to come back from though the Kingstreeters nearly did so in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio pitched well, giving up two unearned runs in the first and then settled in nicely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Varano hit the first pitch of the game for a single, inside of third base, and promptly stole second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a walk to Thomas O'Connell, Maglio's pick-off attempt at first was wild, rolling down the right field line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Varano scored on the play and a sac fly by Longdin scored O’Connell - making it a 2-0 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following that O’Connell base-on-balls, Maglio retired eleven batters in a row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Maglio cruising, Eastern chipped away at the deficit over the following three innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consecutive singles by Owen Myers, Conor Cyr, and Norris produced a run in the second to chop the deficit in half, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, singles by Cole Latko and Maglio, followed by a walk, loaded the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko scored on a groundout to tie things up and the Lancers then scored twice in the fourth frame to go up by two (4-2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singles from Myers and Cyr started the inning and a sacrifice by Norris had runners on second and third for Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then singled in Myers and Cyr scored on a groundout to give the Lancers a two-run edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills cut the lead to 4-3 in the fifth as Ben Rewenko tripled to left and scored on Moriarty's single to center to trim the deficit to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the fateful sixth came and went as Mills established a three-run cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern threatened in the seventh with one out as Rio Fernandez and Ben D'Amato singled off Fisher - putting the tying run at the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a strikeout for the second out, Myers walked to load the bases as Fisher reached the pitch limit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Austin Ouellette relieved Fisher and allowed Cyr an infield single to short for a run, making it 7-5, and Eastern was one hit away from tying the event up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ouellette generated a strikeout for the final out as Mills won by a couple of runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had thirteen hits for the game, all singles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr etched up three singles while Latko, Fernandez, and Myers each had two hits apiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Varano zipped up two hits for Mills, including a double.</p>
