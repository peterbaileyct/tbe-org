<p>Community members of all ages gathered at the Federal Hill Green on Saturday afternoon to celebrate Bristol’s passion for the arts with the Second Annual Cultural District Festival. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a great way to bring the community together to celebrate art,”&nbsp;BPRYCS Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said.&nbsp;“We wanted to shine a light on local artists, businesses and eateries. It’s also an opportunity for everyone to visit the museums, historical landmarks, businesses and all that the cultural district has to offer.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attendees lounged on sunchairs and blankets listening to the velvety vocals of musician Karina Karina who performed several classic hits, including "Smooth Operator," "Dreams" and "Killing Me Softly." Children of all ages had the opportunity to have their faces painted in colorful designs free of charge and play a game of hopscotch. </p>

<p>Local favorite food trucks Dem Boyz Grill &amp; Catering and Greer’s Chicken served savory dishes of chicken, shrimp and fish to eager patrons, with beverage available from craft coffee company Yellow King.</p>

<p>“I just happened to be driving by and I stopped to see what this festival was,” Michael Green said. “I’m glad that I did because this is the best cold brew I’ve ever had.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the highlights of the day was the new Monster Mural unveiled by the Arts &amp; Culture Commission. Standing six feet tall and 15 feet long, the mural depicts an upbeat festival scene filled with music, food and merriment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We chose this mural because we all liked the themes in it,” City Arts &amp; Culture Commission member Andrea Adams said, “art, community, music. It’s nice to see so many people adding to it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Visitors of all ages lined up along the mural with their favorite color markers to contribute to the community art.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve been practicing for this at the Adult Coloring Club at the Bristol Public Library,” Victor Gottheimer said. “I picked a blue marker for my part of the mural, and I had fun coloring.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
