<p>NEW HAVEN - A little school history was made by the Bristol Central girls and boys indoor track teams from the 39th Yale Track Classic in New Haven over the weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams stormed the facility with zest and on the girls side, the 4x400 relay team put together a new record at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Lynae Lewis, Sophia Stark, Tracie Mills and Kate Tran completed the event in 4:17.96 - a new school record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team finished the race in fourth place in its division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The old school record of 4:20.21 minutes was established at Central 21 years ago by the team of Kayla Sakowski, Alyse Phoenix, Alex Czuchta and Erika Nolting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an exciting day for the girls relay team but on the flip side, the boys also had a great day.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
