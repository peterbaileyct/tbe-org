<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Central volleyball team has started the season at 2-0, ending the first week of scholastic competition with a 3-0 sweep of Maloney on Thursday evening in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 25-13, 25-14 and 25-14 as Central has won all six of its sets to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (2-0) played an excellent defensive game against a traditionally tough CCC South opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the course of three sets, Maloney (1-2) was limited to just eight kills as Central’s defense popped up several point-scoring attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Rams dropped down several balls on the Spartans’ side of the court for points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Higgins led the charge with eight kills and six digs while Lily Kirk contributed five kills and plopped in a couple serves that ultimately would never be returned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several players made contributions for Central including Leah Sklenka (two kills), Isabella Alves (two kills) and Emily Fontaine (two aces).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daigelis Figueroa bumped up eight digs while floor general Alex Rivera (16 assists, five digs, three aces) displayed her usual tremendous all-around game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kate Schilling also saw a little floor time for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s Ava Matias had four kills while Myalis DeJesus chipped in with two aces and eight digs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lance Pepper charges have played well to start the campaign and the Central program has six big matches to end the month of September - including a showdown against crosstown rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams go back-to-back to open the new week - battling New Britain (Monday, 6:30 p.m.) from home before taking a quick bus ride to Berlin (6 p.m.) the following day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, it's a CCC confrontation at Southington (6 p.m.) before earning a little court time from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, September 26 Platt hits Bristol (6:30 p.m.) for a CCC South clash and then on Thursday, September 28, it’s Central/Eastern, Part one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time for that exciting bout is 6:30 p.m. and the contest is going to be another no-miss event.</p>
