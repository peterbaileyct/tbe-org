<p>Come Sunday morning, clocks will have been turned ahead an hour, possibly for the last time, but only if Congress acts. Eliminating the time changes was on the Connecticut legislature’s docket last year, and the proposal was shot down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to see the time changes cease. My preference is to stick to standard time—according to sleep experts this arrangement is better for us, more in tune with our circadian rhythms. I am willing to compromise, however, because adjusting to the time change takes it toll on me, especially in November. I am guessing I am not the only one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday night, Mary and I made it to Hartford Stage and its latest, “The Art of Burning,” by Kate Snodgrass, directed by Melia Bensussen. It's a 90-minute world-wind of a performance, with creative yet minimalist staging and characters who careen through it in varying degrees of passion. </p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, I thought I might have had to get out and clear some snow, but the driveway and walks cleared themselves. More snow in the forecast for this week. We’ll have to see how that goes. </p>

<p>Reading/listening: Since it is Lent in the Christian tradition, and I have been listening to several podcasts from the Center for Action and Contemplation, I thought I might offer this one--”John Dominic Crossan on God &amp; Empire!” from Tripp Fuller’s Theology, Philosophy, and Religion from the Barrel podcast.

<p>Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is all the rage, especially predictions about its effect on teaching. A.I.’s ChatGPT and search engines, sweep the internet to answer questions posed to them and then write out the results, giving the appearance that they are “thinking.” The essays forecast doom. I certainly do not fall into that camp. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By extension, a couple of commentators have written associated the advent of A.I. with the end of English studies. That is another story. The truth is that English as a major has taken a hit at colleges and universities, but that has less to do with A.I. and more to do with our fixation as Americans about education and marketability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for A.I. and what it can and cannot do, I point to a New York Times guest essay co-authored by Ian Roberts, Jeffrey Watumull and Noam Chomsky. It’s titled, “The False Promise of ChatGPT.” I wish I had written it.

<p>Wherever one comes down on the subject of A.I., the consolation for me, as an English teacher and major, is that what we do as human beings is more than just sweeping the internet for answers. We think. I teach my students to think.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it appears A.I. “writes,” implying that it thinks, the reality is much different. Students still need to master the skill of thinking for themselves, and there are few activities better than writing which foster this skill. </p>

<p>And TBE has an announcement. Our own Mike Letendre has written a book about Bristol Central’s championship run last year. “Dream Season” runs over&nbsp;230 pages and includes photos, game summaries and profiles of team members. It will be available for sale in print soon from&nbsp;several online platforms, including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Nobles and others. TBE will post the links as soon we get our copies of the book.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While you are waiting for your copy of Mike’s book to come in, pick up Jia Tolentino’s essay collection, “Trick Mirror.” Hers is a refreshing and fearless new voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>St. Patrick’s Day is coming up Friday, and it appears Democrat Scott Rosado has an announcement of his own to make, following the announcement of Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano earlier in February.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
