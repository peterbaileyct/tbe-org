<p>Lucy is a sweet girl who was rescued by her family, Rich and Joan, over three years ago. She came to her forever home in Bristol from the All Four Paws shelter in Pawley's Island, S.C. Her family affectionately call her their “everything dog” because she has over 12 breeds in her genetic make-up.</p>

<p>In addition to big soulful eyes, Lucy has a big voice that she uses to let her family know when local wildlife stroll into the yard. She has let Rich and Joan know about several animal visitors, including a bear, coyote and bobcat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lucy loves playing games with her family, especially a spin game where she has to uncover hidden morsels of food. Her favorite activities are walks, free runs at dog parks and playing with her favorite stuffed squirrel toy. She is beloved by her family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
