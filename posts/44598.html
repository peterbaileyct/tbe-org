<h2 class="wp-block-heading">May is National Foster Care Month</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Studies show that teens who age out of foster care or who do not have more permanent, loving attachments are at increased risk for homelessness, young parenthood, low educational attainment, high unemployment rates, human trafficking, and other adverse adult outcomes, according to a release by Wheeler Health announcing that May is National Foster Care Month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The annual observance recognizes and supports children, youth, and families in the foster care system. Wheeler does this through its Wheeler’s Foster Care, serving youth and families in Waterbury and eight surrounding towns to provide youth, ages 6 to 17, with stable, safe, caring environments for shorter periods of time or potentially longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“On any given day in Connecticut, there are about 3,100 children in foster care, and many more who do not have a place to call home,” said Sharon Pendleton-Ponzani, LCSW, director, Wheeler Foster Care Services, in the release. “This annual observance helps to underscore this need.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Foster families, even for shorter durations, can have real impact,” Pendleton-Ponzani added. “More than addressing a child’s basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter, foster families can become ‘extended family’ and provide the kind of meaningful care and support to help youth in their life journey.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler’s Foster Care program uses the evidence-based Functional Therapy Foster Care Model (FFT Partners) that helps youth in foster care and their families develop skills for lifelong success. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler works with families and others who are important to the youth to help create a healthy support system. The goal is to create stability for the youth while developing their long-term plan, whether that be returning home, or moving to another permanent option. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The model strives to maintain a stable foster placement for six to nine months on average, or potentially, for a longer duration, while the team also works to help move the youth back to their birth family or an adoptive home. A dedicated team of professionals provides weekly in-home sessions with youth and families as well as 24/7 on-call coverage support for the foster family. Support groups, ongoing training, and coordination of services for youth also are provided.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
