<p>The girls senior lacrosse team in Bristol won yet again, this time picking up a victory at Lacrosse Day from Bristol Eastern High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday evening, Bristol lacrosse supporter John Stavens reported that the squad posted another win, this time dropping RHAM by a 13-4 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The triumph propelled the squad from Bristol to an excellent 4-0 record which includes an undefeated mark in league matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And several familiar last names from the scholastic front are found on the roster of this outstanding program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harper Dauphinee and Savannah Drury lead the charge offensively, notching several goals each and every match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Natalia Bye and Cloe LaBrecque help the offense flow, scoring goals and keeping possessions alive for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, keeper Teagan Freimuth is a force at the net while McKenna Bell and Bella Alves chip in nicely on the defensive end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joining that crew are some talented sixth and seventh graders, contributing heavily to those winning efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makinzey Welch has flashed in at least one goal over the past three matches while Mackenzie Ciechoski plays some stellar defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Itâ€™s been a team effort over the entire run, getting contributions from every player that takes the field for the squad from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the team has been developing and improving over the years it's been together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program averages over 10.0 goals-per-game with a season high of 15 netted against Glastonbury and defensively, each and every opponent has been held to single digits this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with the addition of a second team, a collection of talented fourth, fifth and sixth graders, the added program should help the sport of lacrosse grow and prosper in the town of Bristol.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
