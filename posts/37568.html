<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central football team is looking to pull off a Thanksgiving Day upset against rival Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the surging Rams have the firepower to make that statement a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a 1-5 start, the lineup has stabilized and the program is looking for its fourth victory in the row as a 5-5 finish is certainly in the realm of possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are a dual threat offensive team and it will be up to Jack Jones and the rest of the Central defense to slow down a lethal rushing attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have won seven straight Turkey Day games and why stop that tradition now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a victory over that very good program on King Street completely eliminates Eastern from postseason participation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s time for Bristol Central football and here’s what to expect on Thursday morning:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Jeff Papazian (Ninth Thanksgiving Day game as Central’s head coach – winner of seven consecutive showdowns against Eastern).   <br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date and Time of the event</strong>: It’s time to take our annual trip to Muzzy Field at 10:30 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last BC/BE showdown (2022)</strong>: Central zipped up a seven point victory as Tre Blair (48 yard TD run) scored early while defensive minded Anthony Paulino made a late 14-yard interception for a touchdown - sealing the win for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Central leads the all-time series 38-23-2. The squad has truly enjoyed its turkey dinner since 2015. It’s a tradition the program hopes to continue (for at least one more year. Ask the CIAC for details…).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central Series Fact</strong>: Since 1996, each squad has won at least three games in a row before giving back the series to the other program. The only non-winning game during that time was that amazing 14-14 tie back in 2006 when Central’s Aaron Hernandez was stopped by snow, rain and the muck that formulated on the grass at Muzzy Field.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Record: </strong>Central comes into the Thanksgiving Day showdown with a ledger of 4-5, looking to break even and send Eastern out of the playoff picture.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to watch</strong>: Donovan Rodriguez (jr, QB/RB); Anthony Paulino (sr., WR/DB); Jack Jones (sr., OL/LB); Tashawn Cauley (jr, OL/DL); Luis Padilla (sr., OL/DL), Jack Hartley (jr. QB/DB); Cassias Breland (sr., WR/DB); Jayden Glasper (so., RB/DB); Aiden Lamarre (sr., WR/DB); Quincy Lawson (so., WR/DL); Ayden Pratt (sr., OL/DL); Tim Sample (jr., RB/LB); Caleb Simard (jr., TE/LB); Jayden Colon (sr., OL/DL); Zach Holleran (jr., OL/DL); Nathanyel Davis (jr., WR/DB); Tyler Ryan (jr., TE/LB).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Bristol Central could win</strong>…The Rams have been playing some tremendous ball as of late, winning their last three games, and coming into the Thanksgiving Day classic with a boatload of momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That helps make Central a dangerous team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things started to change for the program when junior transfer Donovan Rodriguez was finally able to take the field in the Rams’ sixth game of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He makes his moves via direct snaps and once he sees a little daylight, Rodriguez (91 carries, 430 yards, five touchdowns) is off to the races.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rodriguez averages a sterling 4.7 yards-per-carry and his five rushing TDs leads the team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are pretty good numbers for a ‘part-timer.’&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Rodriguez is allowed to operate in the open field, Eastern is going to have some problems.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Papazian will turn to several other backs to mix things up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Glasper (85 carries, 422 yards, four TDs) and the multitalented - and dangerous - Anthony Paulino (19-208-4) each scored four rushing touchdowns while Tristian Toussaint (35-229-3) and Cassias Breland will also get opportunities with the football.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Hartley (133-416-3) leads the squad in carries and is third in rushing yards but his role changed a bit with Rodriguez in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s blocking in the running game, catching a pass or two and will cause general havoc out on the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley was a factor in last year’s game but he wasn’t wearing maroon colors back then (more on him later).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Central goes to the air, those passes could be thrown for first down yardage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have passed the ball just 48 times this season as six different players have attempted at least one throw.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley completed 14-of-41 passes for 98 yards for a touchdown while Paulino (1-for-1, five yards) has the other TD, a completion to Rodriguez for a score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s thrown seven picks and Eastern (nine made interceptions this season) will be eager to snag a ball or two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quincy Lawson has eight receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown for the Rams to lead the squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Central will turn to Nathanyel Davis, Jack Jones, Quincy Lawson, Tawshan Cauley, Ayden Pratt, Hartley, Lamarre, Glasper, and Paulino.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones has been an absolute beast this season as the senior linebacker has over 100 tackles which includes 18 tackles for a loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That defense is augmented by Aiden Lamarre (45 tackles), Tim Sample (38), and Tyler Ryan (38).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawson has four tackles for losses this season while Luis Padilla always seems to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Padilla is a game-changer with his energy on defense, second on the squad in tackles-for-losses with eleven.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paulino and company were excellent defensively last year against Eastern, allowing its crosstown nemesis just six points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a game for the taking if the Rams can put a full four quarters in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The X-Factor</strong>…Out of all the players to pick from Central’s lineup, there’s no bigger X-factor in this year’s game than Hartley – who transferred from Eastern to Central over the summer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>True, he still has friends over on King Street but the athlete won’t be buddy-buddy with those guys for about two-plus hours on Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley’s role changed from the start of the season with Rodriguez taking over at the QB position but the junior does a little bit of everything well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And his play could spell trouble for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During Thanksgiving last year, Hartley scooped up 55 yards on the ground and his contributions were not just timely but necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s capable of rushing the football for 100 yards, can toss the ball around for a completion or two and could haul in a back-breaking reception.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley can block for Rodriguez all morning long or make a game-saving tackle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s one of the most versatile athletes on the field and Eastern knows the havoc he can create.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Eastern&nbsp;can’t sleep on Hartley on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, Lamarre has kicked in 12 extra points – a big weapon for Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that 14-13 victory against Middletown, his two PATs made all the difference in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central can’t…</strong>Allow Eastern to&nbsp;run the ball here, there and everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if the Rams aren’t paying attention, someone other than Jaiden Fore (1,147 rushing yards) could be making a couple TD jaunts with the pigskin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior stud Adam Zavecz, who will be a problem all morning long when Central is on offense, has shown ability in Eastern’s rushing attack and quarterback Kamden Laprise can get it going when there’s some room to run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Play action has been at its highest in years at Eastern this season and that ability has helped the Kingstreeters light up the scoreboard and spread the field a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s where Jones and company have to make that first tackle count because Fore – if he gets a step or two away from his defender – is off to the races and that’s a no-win scenario for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has been penalized just about 450 yards this season and you know the emotion of Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those costly penalties could see Eastern get to the red zone, a position the Kingstreeters have been extremely proficient in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers score 70-percent of the time - all via touchdown - when the squad gets within the 20 yard line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when Central has the ball, the program is going to have to find a way to run a ball or two into the end zone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of rushing touchdowns allowed, Eastern opponents have carried the ball into the end zone just six times this season – scoring less than half the time as Eastern’s defense made critical red zone stops.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On third downs this year, opponents have been able to tally a first down against Eastern just 27 percent of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s no easy way out when the Lancers’ defense is in motion, giving up just 90 total points this season (9.0 points-per-game allowed).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here’s where the rubber meets the road: Eastern has shutout three of its four opponents on the road in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents average a paltry 6.0 ppg from their own home field against the Lancers and the three shutouts on the road are a BEHS single season school record.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aren’t the Rams the home team this year at Muzzy?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>…Central is playing its best ball right now, averaging 23.0 points-per-game while allowing just 14.0 ppg on the flip side over that perfect 3-0 stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a winning formula and comes at the best possible time of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rodriguez has the offense humming and all 11 players on the field are checked into this one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s offense pushes across 22.4 points-per-game but has allowed opponents to score just two third period touchdowns this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams must make the third quarter count, shutting down the Eastern offense and punching a score home to seize the momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those&nbsp;third period woes have seemingly disappeared over the last three games but Central has been outscored in the quarter 53-21 over the entire season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of that scoring came from early season miscues but the Rams must not let Eastern come out of intermission with a score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the defense holds in the third period, Central has a great chance in this one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And the winner is</strong>…Predictions are silly and please, just use some common sense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has six wins while Central is sprinting hard to the finish line - looking for that magical .500 ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you want me to pick a winner?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s you, the fans and friends of the Bristol Central football program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ve supported the squad all season long and now, it’s time to see what a finished product looks like on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Papazian - who took his coaching staff out to his favorite restaurant ‘Almost Steak’ on Wednesday for the program’s annual BC/BE pregame meal (the coaches feasted on the ‘All you would never eat $4.95 shoe leather special’ as Jeff passed the check to a unsuspecting assistant coach) - has this team positioned and ready for a big win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, throw out all the records that were just talked about and get ready for&nbsp; an amazing clash between Central and Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, if the CIAC is truly going to squash Thanksgiving Day football, then come to Muzzy Field on Thursday to see history unfold on the gridiron for, perhaps, the last time ever on this special holiday. &nbsp;</p>
