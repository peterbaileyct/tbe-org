<p>Three Bristol tobacco retail shops were found to be selling e-cigarettes and tobacco products to youth under 21 years old in January after unannounced inspections, coordinated by local and state law enforcement agencies, the Bristol Police announced in a release today.</p>

<p>Two clerks, one at Haze Smoke Shop on Middle Street and another at Gas Man on Riverside Avenue, respectively, and the owner of Lite It Up Smokeshop on Lake Avenue were charged with the sale of electronic nicotine systems or vapor products to minors.</p>

<p>In late January, members of the Bristol Police Narcotic Enforcement Team along with the State Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Tobacco Prevention and Enforcement Program conducted unannounced inspections of eight Bristol establishments that sell tobacco products and electronic cigarettes, according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inspections were performed by underage undercover agents to determine whether the Bristol shops were complying with state laws concerning the prohibition of the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to youth under the age of 21.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three were found non-compliant.</p>

<p>Five of eight shops were compliant: Smoking Ape at 74 Farmington Ave. and 728 Farmington Ave., respectively, Citgo/Atlantis Fresh Market at 527 Middle St., Bristol Smoke Shop at 948 Pine St. and Avalon Smoke Shop at 45 N. Main St.</p>
