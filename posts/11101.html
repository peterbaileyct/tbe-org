<p>BRISTOL - After a tough loss to Maloney the previous night, what would the response be from the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team against Hall of West Hartford?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about a career night by Eastern All-Stater Ciara Collins?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior leader dropped in a career-high 38 points as the Lancers turned away pesky Hall by a 59-47 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 5-7 overall off the winning endeavor while the Warriors fell to 3-9.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins was simply tremendous, scoring eight points in the first frame while belting Hall for 15 in the second to help the Lancers to a 32-24 push at the half.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied 11 points in the third tilt and by that time of the game, she already had 34 points and her career high was in the bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez scored 10 and added 10 rebounds for a slick double-double while Taigan Parent added five points, six rebounds, and four assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Venessa Drury nabbed two points and two rebounds while Lauren Ayotte started once again - scooping in two points, five rebounds, and two assists over another very good effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel snatched two rebounds, while Leah Roy, Tavia Swain and Gracie LaMar each made contributions to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McKenzie Mandyck&nbsp;netted 18 points to lead the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters never trailed in the contest, leading 15-11 after one period of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall eventually tied it up at 21-21 but with about 3:30 left in the half, Eastern embarked&nbsp;on a quick 9-0 run to nab a sizable halftime push.&nbsp; Gonzalez hit a lay-up and Collins scored three consecutive hoops - hitting a 3 along the way - as the Lancersâ€™ lead grew to 30-21.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors scored the first hoop of the second half to trim the lead to six (30-24) but Eastern used a 15-7 run - capped by a Collins jumper - to open up a 47-33 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ahead 49-38 through three, Eastern outscored Hall 10-9 to end the contest as the Lancers earned a tough 59-47 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of tough, Eastern opened Saturday morning with an early CCC South encounter at Newington high school.</p>
