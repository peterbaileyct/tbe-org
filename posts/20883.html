<p>There’s good news in terms of playoff qualification for the Bristol Central boys basketball team as the defending CIAC Division II champs were booted up to Division I – meaning automatic playoff qualification.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In theory, the squad could go 20-0 or 0-20 and all that would change is the seed they end up with for the postseason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This slate of games in front of the Rams won’t be easy as Central will be squaring off against all the giants of the CCC due to the Rams’ 43-0 jaunt over the past two seasons (60-5 if counting the past three seasons combined).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, the BCHS boys have lost just five games since 2019 – a tremendous ledger of success – with its last loss coming back in the CCC Tournament in 2020 (an 85-48 loss to East Catholic back on February 29).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with the squad a bit down from past campaigns, it won’t be easy to generate wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On opening night, it’s a tough showdown against Manchester&nbsp;–&nbsp;the same squad current UConn big man Donovan Clingan debuted against as a freshman at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That opener takes place from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on Thursday night at 6:45 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s before the Rams start talking about having to combat Northwest and East Catholic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly for Central, it’s out of the pan and into the fire right off the bat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obviously, you have to take small victories when you’re playing those types of teams,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “We’ve already qualified for the Division I state playoffs. We’re already in. You go out there with the intent to win every game. But we have to go out there with the intent to play our best defensive game possible and then learn how to play varsity basketball at the offensive end as quickly as possible.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just after Christmas, the Rams will host three teams at the Bristol Central Holiday Classic on December 27 and 29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>South Windsor returns to the tournament, as does crosstown rival Bristol Eastern, along with newcomer Simsbury as Wolcott dropped out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On night one, the Rams and Lancers clash at 7:30 p.m. in the final game of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then things get real as the calendar year turns to 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central travels to Farmington (January 5) and five days later, it’s off to Windsor (January 10) in a big regular season rematch from last season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s a four-pack of games that would challenge any good program to end the month of January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams compete at Xavier (January 20), takes on Northwest Catholic (January 24), at Platt (January 27) and battles East Catholic (January 31) in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m playing Xavier on the road,” said Barrette. “And it’s not like I picked up anyone else either. We’ve been trying to do that over the last couple of years but I’m hoping the experience even with some of these kids who came with us to the venues that we played in [last year] makes some of these gymnasiums feel not so big to them this season.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In February, Central is on the road four times with home games against Lewis Mills (February 7) and Middletown (February 17) sprinkled in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And wouldn’t it be something if both Central and Eastern are stuck on seven victories apiece come February 20 when the schools square off in the final regular season game of the year?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That final battle commences from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on February 20 at 6 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have to get up to snuff to get prepared to hopefully make a run at the end of the season at the conference title at least,” said Barrette. “But with that being said, our schedule is extremely tough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s no hiding from it.”&nbsp;</p>
