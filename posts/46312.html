<p>The BE Lady Lancers headed to #1 seed Masuk on Tuesday and left with some heartbreak after a 16-5 loss. The end of careers brought tears to some seniors as Meg Krok, Jayna Hatcher, Emma Stavens, Vanessa Drury and Gabby McLay walked off the field for the final time in a Lancer uniform.</p>

<p> Masuk was never really threatened during the game, as it became obvious why they had earned the top seed in the tournament by their skilled and poised performance.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the player of the game for the Eastern was an unexpected surprise this season, freshman goalie Erin Martin. Having never played the sport before, she stepped into the most unforgiving spot on the field and played admirably.  She held several Masuk possessions scoreless because of her quick reflexes and toughness. </p>

<p>Another bright spot for the Lancers was another freshman, Harper Dauphinee, who scored two goals to establish the single-season freshman record with 37 goals. Her skill in taking girls on with moves around the 12-meter arch and her ability to take the draw secured her spot as an up-and-comer to watch. </p>

<p>Emma Stavens provided the other three goals Tuesday night to finish her career with 256, and this year with a program single-season record of 89. Vanessa Drury also established her mark on the program with just under 175 goals for her career and two seasons over 50 goals. </p>

<p>The future looks bright for the Lancers as they hope to continue their run of two consecutive CCC tournament births and three straight CIAC tournament births. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With returning players like Leah Roy, Kate Patterson, Shannon Philippon and Maggie Kozikowski, combined with freshman Erin Martin, Harper Dauphinee, McKenna Bell, Natalia Vye, Alaina Joy, Savannah Drury and Alison Craig, the team has a good mix of experience and talent. Add in a couple of talented incoming freshman from the youth team and next year's squad shouldn’t miss a beat.</p>
