<p>Two World War II veterans will participate in this year's "Bells for Peace" ceremony at The Rockwell Theater on Veterans Day, Monday, Nov. 9, at The Rockwell Theater on Memorial Boulevard.</p>

<p>Iwo Jima survivor Joe Caminiti and Navy veteran Dick Fitz will ring the bell from the U.S.S. Kidd, a World War II destroyer notable for its service in the Pacific Theater, at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in memory of World War I veterans. The Armistice was signed on that day in 1918 ending what was then considered the "Great War" to end all wars.</p>

<p>The ceremony is one of many being held across the country as part of a program run out of Washington, D.C., according to American Legion Post 2 historian Neal Supranovich, who was attending the Bristol Brass and Wind Ensemble's "Salute to Veterans" held on Sunday at the Rockwell.</p>

<p>The ceremony, which is open to the public, runs about 45 minutes, Supranovich said, and includes the ringing of the bell, the reading of the names of veterans who have passed between Memorial Day and Veterans Day, prayers and possibly a performance.</p>

<p>Veterans Day commemoration continues through the day and the month, Supranovich said.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. on Monday, Hillside Community Church holds its annual meatloaf dinner, where all veterans eat free.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Jimmy's on the River provides free breakfast for veterans. Any veteran can obtain a free breakfast ticket from Veterans Strong Community Center in the days leading up to the breakfast, Supranovich said. </p>
