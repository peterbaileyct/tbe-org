<p>“Seder” means order and the Passover Seder is a meal which is organized with a specific structure. It contains many rituals and foods which have special meanings. The meal is accompanied by the reading of the “Haggadah”, the story of the exodus of the Jewish people which was led by Moses.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The April 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;event will include some of the rituals and will include instructions for those who want to participate at home. &nbsp;Although this version will not include a meal, some of the many foods included in a traditional seder will be described and participants will be given a list of some foods to have on hand if they choose to eat them at home. A shortened version of the Haggadah will be read, with time allotted at the end for questions.&nbsp;</p>
