<p>WINDSOR - It’s a tie, everyone wins!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the case of the boys soccer squad from Bristol Eastern, a stalemate against Windsor on Thursday meant instant state tournament qualification -- a big victory of sorts for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers punched its postseason ticket with a 0-0 tie at Windsor, moving to 6-4-1 on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big-time reward for the program at Eastern as the defense ruled the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors, showing more than a little speed on the pitch, moved to 4-3-4 by the completion of the CCC interdivisional bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was an extreme test for the Kingstreeters but each and every challenge was dealt with and answered that afternoon in Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors had more of the play in the first half, but its only good shot -- an attempt by Nigel Martin -- just went over the Eastern crossbar late in the half.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, the Lancers were able to generate just three shots early as offense was at a premium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Windsor's quickness put us on our heels early," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. “We talked at the half about being more aggressive and spreading them out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Warriors simply kept the pressure on over the final forty though no ball rolled into the net as the Eastern’s back line, headlined by keeper Peyton Cummings and defensive guru Rio Fernandez, made all the stops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, in fact, had the better of the play in the second half and nearly scored late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hunter Scott bounced an attempt off the post and somehow, Windsor goalie Owen Antoine found the ball on the ground to keep the match a scoreless stalemate.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was able to generate several attacks down the flanks but couldn't generate a game-winning goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Backs Leslie Adzo and Rio Fernandez had outstanding games shutting down Windsor's two most dangerous players, while Eddie Ansah, Landon Gawel, Aiden Collins, and Sam Lamar were steady in central defending,” said Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cummings, earning another shutout, made seven saves while Antoine nabbed six. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern gets back to the CCC South grind on Monday when pesky Plainville comes to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will be looking for the season sweep against the Blue Devils with the bout commencing at 6 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
