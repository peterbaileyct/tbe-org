<p><strong>Names</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s another one of my name segments, which started when my cousin Marsha (Vail) Parker’s name came up recently. She married her grammar and Bristol Eastern High School boyfriend, Terry Parker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found out that Terry’s real name is E. Terry Parker, and I guess it’s because his late father’s first name was Ernest. Terry also had two brothers, Gary, the late teacher at Bristol Central, and Jeffrey, the youngest of the three and now deceased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “E.” brought to mind Bristol legend Bart Barnes. He was called “Bart” with the official name we knew as E. Bartlett Barnes. Not sure what the E. stood for, because his father was Arthur Barnes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came across the name of a former Bristol resident Joseph A. Marine, 85, who just passed away. And, yes, he had served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Joseph was a "Marine." Thank you for your service, Mr. Marine! Yes, he was a true Marine.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>James “Chipper” Jones (1945-2024)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chipper was from a large Forestville family. A graduate of Bristol Eastern, he was very likable and a longtime softball enthusiast. I knew or know many of his family members. We go back to our Forestville Boys Club days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He enjoyed lunch at Sporty’s, a bar and restaurant his brother, George, once owned. The softball-playing community was tight. Jocks like Hank Kuharski, Marty Hurwitz and Malcom Merriman saw themselves as friends.   </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My friend, Lorette Caouette, recalled him as one of the nice kids growing up in “The Village.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Charles J. Riordan</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol High had some standout football players during the 1920’s and 30’s. One was Mr. Riordan who played for NYU before suiting up for nine games with the early NFL’s Staten Island Stapletons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Streets</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a number of streets here that have names which could be changed, because there really is no relationship with Bristol. The only thing is, it would require a lot of work to change them money-wise, paper-ise, etc. Not worth doing so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for the purpose of entertainment, I have some names which might earn such an honor. They are Robert Fiondella Way, Arthur Ward Way, Bob Montgomery, only kidding, Bristol Landfill or Dump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like John Smith a lot and his name could be slipped in somewhere. John Smith Street instead of Smith Street. Donovan Street could be referring to Mr. Clingan. Rolfe Rowe could be used as a roadway called Ralph Way.</p>

<p><strong>Shoutout</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To gentleman Jerry Nocera.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
