<p>Senior pitcher Jamie Leggett was brilliant on the mound Thursday afternoon and led St Paul to an 8-0 win over visiting Ansonia. Leggett pitched the first 6 innings allowing only 3 hits while striking out 12. <br></p>

<p>Freshman Dom Napoletano finished the game allowing only 1 hit, and that baserunner was erased on the double play that ended the game. For the game, no Ansonia baserunner reached third base safely. </p>

<p>Starter Joe Czajkowski took the loss for Ansonia.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 1st inning, Logan Rembish led off for the Falcons with an infield single, and then stole 2nd to move into scoring position. Rembish advanced to 3rd on Jamie Leggett's groundout, and then scored on a wild pitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looked as if St Paul was going to have a big inning in the 2nd. After a walk to Jonathan Remillard, a single by AJ Corrado, and a walk to Arden Polverari, St Paul had the bases loaded with no outs. Kyle Wilson then stroked a single to left. Remillard scored and Corrado attempted to score from 2nd. But left fielder Ben Ekstrand made a perfect throw to catcher Ashmer Pedraza, and Corrado was out at the plate. A couple of fly balls later, and the inning was over, and St Paul got only the one run, and led 2-0.</p>

<p>In the 3rd inning, St. Paul loaded the bases again, this time with one out. Corrado hit what looked to be a SAC fly to right, but right fielder James Mikita made a perfect throw to Pedraza, and Devin Kulas was gunned down attempting to score from 3rd, and that ended the inning.</p>

<p>While the Ansonia offense was unable to get anything going all game, their defense made a number of outstanding plays to keep the game close. <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St Paul's lead was only 2-0 going into the bottom of the 5th. But with two outs, Ryan Kilpatrick singled and Jonathan Remillard then hit the next pitch over the left field fence, and St Paul's lead doubled to 4-0.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 6th, Wilson led off with a single. Rembish followed with a walk. Leggett hit a slow dribbler that he beat out for an infield hit, and the ball was thrown away allowing Wilson to score. Kulas followed with a 3 run blast over the left center field fence. St Paul led 8-0, and all the drama was gone. Final- St.Paul 8, Ansonia 0.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
