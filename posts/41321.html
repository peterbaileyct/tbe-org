<p>“We talked about just getting out and getting easy opportunities,” Eastern coach Bounty Ray said. “We really didn’t set up all that much. We ran a couple sets but for the most part, everything was up the floor fast, reversed, got it inside and got it out. Shooters were making shots and I think the scoring was pretty balanced.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
