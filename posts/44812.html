<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team opened up an 8-0 lead over Tolland and went on to defeat the Tolland Eagles by the score of 8-5 on Monday afternoon, in a game played at Tolland High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Nocera pitched the complete game win for Eastern&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;five hits and four earned runs. &nbsp;Nocera was in complete control except for the fifth inning when Tolland scored four runs on three hits. &nbsp;He retired the side in order in the first, second, and seventh innings.</p>

<p>Eastern struck for two in the top of the first. &nbsp;Noah Molinsky singled, stole second, and scored on Ben D’Amato’s double to right. &nbsp;D’Amato moved to third on a wild pitch and scored on Owen Myers sacrifice fly.</p>

<p>Eastern added four runs in the top of the third. &nbsp;Caleb Molinsky reached on an error, and went to third on a hit-&amp;-run&nbsp;single by Gabe White. &nbsp;D’Amato then doubled to deep right to score Molinsky. &nbsp;Myers then singled to left, driving in White and D’Amato. &nbsp;Preston Guarda followed with a single, and Mason Harris singled in Myers with the fourth run of the inning. Eastern now led 6-0.</p>

<p>In the Eastern fourth, a walk&nbsp;and a hit batter put&nbsp;two&nbsp;runners on. &nbsp;Noah Molinsky followed with a single to right to score a run, and another run scored when the right fielder misplayed the ball. Eastern seemed to be in total control with an eight run lead.</p>

<p>Nocera sailed until the fifth. &nbsp;In the Tolland fifth, two walks opened the inning. &nbsp;Evan Clark singled by third, seemingly loading the bases, but the BE third baseman was called for interference, all runners moving up a base. &nbsp;And a groundout, a single, a bad-hop single by short, and a sac fly accounted for four Tolland runs in the inning, and the Eastern margin was now a four run lead, 8-4.</p>

<p>Tolland scored an unearned run in the sixth. An infield error put a runner on, and a single and sacrifice fly scored the run. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the score now at 8-5, Nocera retired the side in order in the seventh to secure the win.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had eight hits for the game, two apiece by D’Amato and Noah Molinsky.</p>
