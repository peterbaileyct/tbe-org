<p>Local rock and roll legends are coming together at Bleachers this weekend for a two-night charity concert to benefit veterans. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The musical fundraiser “Monsters of Rock“ is being organized by Mike Cansdale of Big Mac Productions in honor of his late brother Eldon John Cansdale, an Army veteran and Russian Linguist who was stationed in Germany.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The concert idea came from helping my brother, who was a disabled veteran,” Mike Cansdale said, “and I’ve seen firsthand how hard it is on veterans to get the help they need. I organized my first benefit as he kept saying he wished there was more help for veterans. He passed away a few weeks before my first show.”</p>

<p>The proceeds from the benefit concert will aid active military suicide prevention, with donations going to Stop Soldier Suicide, Mission 22 and TAPS (Tragedy Assistance Programs for Survivors).</p>

<p>“My shows benefit veterans organizations that need help,” Cansdale said. “We did one show for all the veterans at the hospital in Rocky Hill and they spent the money on blankets and socks. Even little things are very important to them and their needs. This weekend of shows will benefit current veterans and suicidal prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;We make sure all the money goes right to the organization and it doesn’t touch our hands.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
