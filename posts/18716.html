<p>MANCHESTER – In what is seemingly a yearly occurrence, the boys cross country squad from Bristol Central is once again the CCC South champs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That title was cemented on Tuesday afternoon from Wickham Park in Manchester at the CCC Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams ended the regular season at 13-1 in CCC South competition and 14-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all, 217 runners crossed the finish line that day with Central stud Frankie Porrini nabbing fifth place overall – winning the individual CCC South championship in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was a total team effort as fellow senior Chris Roy also ran well, nabbing third place overall in the CCC South and 28th overall with a finish of 17:50.5 and that meant the Porrini/Roy duo earned All-Conference accolades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Patrick Wininger (18:31.3) took 10th in the South and 53rd overall while Lance Archibald (20th in CCC South, 19:22.8) and Nick DiMatteo (30th CCC South, 20:22) allowed the Rams to tally second place overall in the CCC South standings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scott Petrosky (34th, 20:36.6) and Aiden Georgakopoulos (35th, 20:43.3) rounded out Central’s top seven.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville (49 points) had one of its best showings of the year to capture the CCC South race with Central (63) the runner-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills (68 points) came in third place while Berlin (80) nabbed fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m proud of the boys team,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “They raced for position today to hold off Lewis Mills and Bristol Eastern who we had close duals with. Plainville had a great day today to upset our perfect season. Frankie Porrini ran a strong race to finish in the top five in the CCC, the most competitive conference in the state. Chris Roy has had a great season and joins Frankie on the All-Conference Team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern did extremely well, coming in fifth place overall with 87 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dominic Tartarelli (seventh in CCC South, 19:19.3) had a day on the course and earned All-Conference honors for his efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Mulcunry (ninth in the CCC South, 18:21.1), Brendan Tartarelli (21st, 19:23.5), Aidan Gezelman (23rd, 19:29.5), Aidan Tartarelli (27th, 19:58.3), Dylan Prince (28th, 20:16) and Cole Beland (37th, 21:00.8) all gave it their best efforts for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall’s Isaac Mahler (16:10.9) won the CCC individual championship while just seven seconds separated second through fifth place which included Porrini’s outstanding finish.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Top ranked Hall (41 team points) did not have an equal in the CCC field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edwin O. Smith (124) was a distant second place while Glastonbury (149) earned third.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the JV heat, an amazing 437 boys finished the race and had several local harriers in the mix.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Jonathan Casarola ran well, seizing 138th place with a time of 22:08.6 while teammates Ben Kozikowski (22:40.1) and Chris Serafin (23:00.1) also ran well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall High School took nine of the first 10 spots in the race, dominating the JV bout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Hall’s Donovan Connole won the race with a sterling time of 17:46.8.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On Tap</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s plenty of action on the course to end the month of October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Tuesday, the CCC Freshman Invite takes place from the track at Hall High School in West Hartford while the following weekend, all the classes battle it out in the state championships from Wickham Park.</p>
