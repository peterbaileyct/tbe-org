<p>With the NBA draft today and Bristol's Donovan Clingan in the spotlight as one of the players expected to go early in the first round, ESPN has produced a video highlighting Clingan's connection to his hometown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Entitled, "Donovan Clingan and Bristol Central High School: A perfect match," the video features Bristol Central High School alum Clingan being interviewed by another Bristol Central alum, Adrian "The Woj" Wojnarowski, ESPN luminary and NBA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The subtitle is "Find out why Donovan Clingan chose to stay at his hometown high school of Bristol Central before he became a two-time NCAA champion at UConn."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The video begins with Clingan walking through the doors of the high school and ends with him exiting. In various clips, Clingan is viewed sitting across from Wojnarowski in the gymnasium, passing the trophy case and playing in games during his state championship season.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The video revolves around the role his late mother Stacey Porrini Clingan played in her son's life, and includes conversations with his father, Bill, and BCHS basketball coach Tim Barrette.  </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
