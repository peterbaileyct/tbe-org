<p>Bristol Central’s Cross Country teams had a good first day on the course at the Stratton Brook Invitational in Simsbury on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will be a building year for Central with a young team. In fact the girl’s team is so young that only one girl ran in the varsity race.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the boys and girls teams are led by sophomores. The boys team all ran personal records on the course at Stratton Brook and sophomore Emersyn Mazzei had a super strong first showing for the girls.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
