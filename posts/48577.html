<p>Did you know that there are a number of Jewish holidays in the summertime? This year, there are three holidays just in the months of July and August, two of which are connected to each other: Tzom Tammuz and Tisha B’Av.<br><br>Tzom Tammuz is a minor fast holiday in which Jewish people do not eat from dawn to sunset. The Hebrew word “tzom” means “fast.” This holiday is also known as Shivah Asar B’Tammuz, which means the 17th of the Hebrew calendar month of Tammuz. This holiday marks the beginning of a three-week period of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem and the First and Second Temples.<br><br>The 17th of Tammuz commemorates five devastating events for the Jewish community: Moses smashed the tables with the Ten Commandments on them that he had received at Mount Sinai, during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem the priests had to stop offering the daily sacrifice due to the dwindling amount of sheep available, a Roman general named Apostomos burned a Torah scroll, the Romans placed an idol in the Temple, and the Romans breached the walls of Jerusalem in 69 CE. Three weeks after this breach, the Second Temple was destroyed, on the ninth of the Hebrew calendar month Av, also known as the holiday of Tisha B’Av.<br><br>Tisha B’Av marks the destruction of both the First and Second Temples, as well as many other catastrophes that have befallen the Jewish people. This holiday concludes the three-week mourning period. On this day, we fast for 25 hours. While Jewish people are encouraged to study on most holidays, we are prohibited from doing so on Tisha B’Av, as studying is meant to be joyful. When we break this fast, the somber mood continues through the meal, as we do not consume any meat or wine.<br><br>While this three-week period is a time of mourning and grief, it is also a time of hope. On Tisha B’Av, we read from the Book of Lamentations, “Turn us to You, O God, and we will return. Renew our days as of old.” We conclude Tisha B’Av with a sense of hope for the future. The time of mourning comes to an end, and we turn towards a brighter future, as we prepare for the Jewish New Year, Rosh HaShanah.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
