<p>BRISTOL - The Berlin boys soccer team is a very good outfit and on Thursday evening in Bristol, the squad scored a convincing 3-0 triumph over Bristol Eastern from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats moved to 3-2-1 overall while the Lancers (4-2) lost for just the second time this season - snapping their three-game winning streak.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin nabbed two goals over the first forty and added an insurance score in the final period to snare the three-goal victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Abayomi scored the first goal of the showdown, breaking free down the left side of the pitch - chipping the ball over Lancers’ keeper Peyton Cummings with 6:20 gone in the first.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes later, the Redcoats were at it again.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 13:42 remaining in the first period, Thomas Francalangia headed in a ball at Eastern's near post to make it a 2-0 affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, at the midway point of the second stanza, Joseph Francalangia drilled a hard shot to the far left inside of the Eastern net to push the deficit out to 3-0.</p>

<p>"Berlin was quick and efficient at moving the ball and our inability to hold the ball near midfield put our backs under pressure," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.  "Early in the second half, we had a few good chances to cut the lead in half, but our shots missed the mark.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin keepers Austin Boninsegna (two) and Omar Montanez (two) combined for four saves while Cummings stopped six shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eastern next hosts Hartford Public at 4:30 p.m. on Monday from Alumni Field.</p>
