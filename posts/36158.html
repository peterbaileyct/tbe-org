<p>With the municipal election nearing on Nov. 7, TBE thought we might provide some background on one of the lesser-known public offices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Board of Assessment Appeals is a municipal board that is responsible for hearing appeals from property owners who believe that the assessment on their property is in excess of or, in some cases, below its fair market value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The board members review each case and determine the disposition of the appeal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The property owner may appeal to the New Britain Superior Court, the judicial district for the City of Bristol, if they still feel that the assessment is incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The board consists of three members who are elected in odd-numbered years at the municipal election.&nbsp;The position consists of a two-year term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
