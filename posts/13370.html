<p>HARTFORD - In the ‘Insurance Capital of the World’ – also known as Hartford, Connecticut – the Bristol Eastern baseball team needed a victory in the worst possible way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a non-conference game from Colt Park on Wednesday night, the Lancers spun Hartford Public/HMTCA&nbsp;over a 14-0 demolition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown was called off after five innings via the mercy rule as&nbsp;Eastern improved to 6-10 overall, still needing two wins over its four final games to qualify for postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And against the co-op program from Hartford, Eastern sophomore Ben D’Amato nearly no-hit the competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw a five-inning gem, allowing just two singles and retired eleven of the final twelve batters he faced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato collected eight strikeouts and did not allow a free pass along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hartford squad fell to 1-17 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, one Conor, along with another Connor, led the hit parade for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conor McCormick had a double and triple while Connor Cyr added two singles, scored twice, and scooped up two RBI for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Elliot Norris had two singles as Eastern jammed out 11 hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters notched seven first inning runs and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Base-on-balls to McCormick and Jaydon Churchill opened the game, followed by a two-run single up the middle by Cyr, making it a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato then dropped in a pop-fly double to left, plating Cyr, as the Lancers went up 3-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Jose Feliciano's fly ball to right center was dropped, one of five Hartford errors on the evening, Rio Fernandez tripled to deep left center to clear the bases as D'Amato and Feliciano both scored to get Eastern on top, 5-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Kingstreeters weren’t done as Cole Latko's sacrifice fly tallied another run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, Norris singled to center, stole second, and scored on a wild throw by the pitcher on a pickoff attempt at second base to propel the visitors to a 7-0 edge before the home squad even got a chance at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the second, Eastern was at it again from the dish – scoring five additional runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a single and two walks loaded the bases with no outs, a sacrifice fly by Feliciano scored a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern added a run via a groundout and an RBI single by Norris made it a 10-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final two runs scored on a catcher's throwing error as Latko and Norris were on first and second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball was chucked into right field on a botched pickoff attempt, scoring the duo as a 12-0 lead followed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern notched single runs in the fourth and fifth frames before the mercy rule came into effect as the Lancers hit the pay window via a huge 14-0 victory on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters are back action on Friday night against a surging Hall program at 6:30 p.m. from Muzzy Field.</p>
