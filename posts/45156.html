<p>The Bristol Public Library is hosting the Fiesta del Norte Quartet on Wednesday, May 8 at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut’s first mariachi band, Fiesta del Norte is a Mexican Mariachi band performing the traditional folk and popular music of Mexico. A hallmark of a Fiesta del Norte concert is the wonderful audience participation on every song.</p>

<p>Bristol Public Library assistant director Scott Stanton said it is part of their monthly music series called the library coffee house. He said the volunteer group, The Friends of the Library, provide hospitality like coffee and snacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s no charge for these events,” Stanton said. “Where else can you go to have an evening like that for no charge?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stanton said their numbers are starting to approximate what they used to have before COVID-19.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is an entertainment event, but for some of these people, it’s a big part of their social interaction during the week,” Stanton said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Public Library readers’ advisor Deanna Foular said they are seeing many new faces since Bristol is growing all the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a good place to find friends and make connections,” Foular said. “It’s really nice to spread that kind of connections.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Foular said her and Stanton host events on a three-month basis which allows people to plan ahead of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re a resource for more than just a book,” Foular said. “We feed the mind in all kinds of ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said community is the purpose behind holding these events. Attendees see the same faces which allows them to really get to know the people there, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s a place to be quiet in the library,” Foular said. “There’s a place to have fun too.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
