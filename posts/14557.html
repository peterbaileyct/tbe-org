<p>The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team is hoping for a big finish in 2022 and will need all hands on deck to get there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the top of Bristol’s batting order remains Elliot Norris at leadoff and Jayden Churchill in the second spot, forming a tough 1-2 combo, Adam Caron - Bristol’s slick third baseman - was batting third but moved down the order to fifth in the contest at West Hartford on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 1-for-4 in that showdown at Conard but has actually been hitting the ball well throughout the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, he’s been excellent at third base, using his size and length to snare the ball, but when Caron’s been at the dish, the hits always seemed to be roped at a waiting fielder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Adam just can’t buy any luck,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Caron. “He’s just hitting the ball right on the nose, right at people.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he’s been getting on base via walks, moving players around and doing the little things at the plate to help the Post 2 offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can slot him third, fifth, or even sixth in the batting order and he’ll produce something positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he starts to string a little of his hitting together, Bristol will be all the better for it.</p>

<p><strong>New Bats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>American Legion Baseball in the state of Connecticut has switched over to aluminum bats this season and if you a good hitting team, runs can pile up in a hurry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why when West Hartford zipped up a 9-0 push over Bristol this past Tuesday, it wasn’t any surprise when Post 2 made a near epic comeback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol dropped in a six run sixth to chop the deficit to three with an inning left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was anyone’s game at that point of the showdown but West Hartford ending up winning by that 9-6 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With aluminum bats, no lead is safe anymore,” said LaPenta. “If [West Hartford is] up 9-0 in the past with wood bats, the game’s over. But not with aluminum bats.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol can score runs as the program posted 39 combined runs over its past six games (6.5 runs-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>West Hartford nearly clinches Zone 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s looking more and more likely that the squad from West Hartford is going to win the Zone 1 title outright.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 11-0 overall, the team clinched at least part of the zone title after Post 2 fell at home to Simsbury (4-3) on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This loss [against Simsbury] probably makes the zone unreachable right now,” said LaPenta. “West Hartford has played so many more games. They only have five games left. We have five losses.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a path to a Zone 1 championship for Bristol but a number of things must take place in order for that to occur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“West Hartford would have to lose all [their remaining games]. We’d have to beat them twice and we’d both have two losses against each other,” said LaPenta with other criteria determining the Zone 1 winner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 played in a tournament this past weekend and gets right back to work in Zone 1 action with two home games after the holiday break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 5, West Hartford battles Meriden and then has a huge rematch against Bristol the following Thursday from Conard High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 finishes its regular season slate with dates against Simsbury (July 9), Bristol (July 12) and Meriden (July 13) - all on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the West Hartford squad can win one of those five remaining games, Bristol will be looking for a strong second place finish in Zone 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is 5-4 in Zone 1 play, 1.5 games in front of third place Simsbury (4-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol can keep pace by winning its last seven games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the two big bouts versus West Hartford, Bristol has a challenging twin bill at Meriden - playing five straight games in a row from Ceppa Field before finally coming home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have two weeks left to play our best baseball towards the playoffs,” said LaPenta. “We’ll see where we’re going to be.”</p>
