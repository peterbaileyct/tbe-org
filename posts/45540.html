<p>The annual Bristol Twilight Interleague Charity Exhibition game at Muzzy Field featuring the Bristol Shock of the Connecticut Twilight League (CTL) and the Bristol Greeners of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League will take place this evening at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In honor of National Police Week, the teams will be competing once again while raising funds to support the Bristol Police and the families of fallen officers Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy. Last year the teams raised just over $1.000 total between online and in-person donations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This initiative was spearheaded by player/coach Trevor Mays of the Greeners and player/coach Justin Martella of the Shock, a Wolcott police officer who lives with his family here in Bristol. A collaborative effort, Lt. Robert C. Osborne of the Bristol Police in 2023 helped make last year’s event possible.</p>

<p>The teams look to continue that collaboration this year and will be collecting at the gate of Muzzy Field, but anyone wishing to donate to the Fund the First campaign for officers Hamzy and Demonte’s families may donate online here: <a href="https://fundthefirst.com/campaign/sergeant-dustin-demonte-and-officer-alex-hamzy-r4fq06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fund the First Campaign for Officers Hamzy &amp; DeMonte</a>.</p>

<p>Heading into their fourth year in the Greater Hartford Twilight League, the Bristol Greeners look poised to have their most successful season to date. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a core group of returning players, a pitching staff that finally looks to remain healthy, and several newcomers that will fill in much needed gaps, the team’s on-the-field product is sure to shatter expectations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Mays returns to lead the Greeners as their manager. Both Trevor and Kenny Knox return to the mound this year after missing last season recovering from Tommy John surgery. A.J. Lorenzetti returns to the squad a married man as the team’s longest tenured player.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight's exhibition is the fourth annual meeting with the Shock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Shock are starting their second year with their new name, and 22<sup>nd</sup> year overall. The team looks to build upon falling just short of returning to the CTL Championship, losing in the CTL semifinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Shock return many of their core and best players from 2023. The team is losing one of its longest tenured members, Rick Barrett, as he retired as a regular player. Rick still helps behind the scenes and will show up to bolster the roster when needed, but we’ll miss his everyday presence. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Ricks 15-year tenure with the Knights/Shock, he was part of three CTL Championship teams, a many time all-star, and the team’s player/manager since 2019. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Returning to the lineup this year after missing the last year or so are Bristol Knights (and Bristol H.S. &amp; Legion) veterans Kyle Pileski and Noah Plantamuro.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight's exhibition is followed with the Shock's first game with their Connecticut Twilight League opening game against the Wethersfield Dodgers.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
