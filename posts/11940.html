<p>Come Sunday morning, our Bristol Central Rams boys basketball team will have capped a tremendous season by beating the Northwest Catholic Lions in the Division II state championship game in Uncasville. Our Mike Letendre has a recap and loads of commentary about the season and the championship. Use the search function and one after another will appear for your viewing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Congratulations Rams (my alma mater, incidentally), Coach Barrette (BEHS alum) and the entire boys team, especially marquee player and all-around good person Donovan Clingan and his fellow seniors Damion Glasper, Victor Rosa, Steve Alseph and Carson Rivoira. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Following the Rams over the week helped me get through the change to Daylight Savings Time, my first cold of the season—colds are no fun and all the coughing during the times of corona virus makes things more complicated because the question lingers about whether I have it--and the initial week of March Madness. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, at the end of the week, was Jay’s wake and funeral. Jay, one of my oldest friends, from first grade at Callen School through high school and much of our lives, was probably among the savviest, in a good way, persons I knew, especially when it comes to human nature. And this was confirmed in the stories that we all shared—from his brother and sister to other friends and family. And of course, there were the photos from the time he was a baby through his exploits on several Bristol Central football teams and on through his ventures cooking.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the nicest things to come away with, practical and memorable, is the recipe book his fiancee Mary Lou put together for a gift. I can’t wait to try the recipe for Jay’s Italian Ricotta Cookies (which his daughter-in-law and her mom used for the desserts at his celebration of life).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same tribute, and the most memorable, his son, Joey, singing “My Way,” as a slide show of photos from Jay’s life scrolled across the&nbsp;screen. I was among those as the song ended, adding my sniffles to the silence. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As when other people close to me have passed and I find myself thinking of them (and talking to them) daily, recounting silly and profound moments we spent together, so it has been with Jay. &nbsp;God bless, friend.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And prayers for Mary Lou, Joey, Jay’s brother Fred and sisters Tina and Dawn. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(And, yes, the voices of all the people who came together to celebrate his life continue to resonate—many friends among them—and the hope is that we won’t wait so long to gather again, but as happens, life intercedes and we know the rest.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>And for this week’s reading/listening assignment, a difficult and complicated suggestion. It may even require several passes, but it will be worthwhile. Yale historian Timothy Snyder, author of&nbsp;<em>The Road to Unfreedom </em>(2018), discusses Ukraine, its history with Russia and narratives that expand our ability to resolve the tragedy that is unfolding daily.
