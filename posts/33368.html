<p>Summer’s ripe tomatoes will bring him to mind for his love of gardening. His favorite hobby was as a talented antique furniture restorer. He, along with Claire, was the pied piper of several generations of neighborhood kids who would gather on their patio to talk and talk. Mike was a gift of light to everyone who knew him. </p>

<p>A gentle man and a gentleman, Mike was a humble and ever cheerful person who could always find the humor of a situation, he accepted everyone for their best self, and could surprise you with his simple insights of people. His secrets to a long life – grow up eating the food you grew, keep busy and curious, live in the present by being content with what your life is, always find the positive of any circumstances, and put hot sauce on everything. </p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
