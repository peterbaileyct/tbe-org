<p>TBE reported yesterday that Bakery on Maple would be closing in mid-August, however, a new sign on the door informs patrons that the bakery will be closing this Saturday, July 27.</p>

<p>"This coming Saturday will be our last day open to the public," the letter states. </p>

<p>The letter from owners Ericka Stirk and David Landi informs patrons that there will be items on sale, "as much of whatever we can make as possible," and encourages people to "Come on down and share one last memory with us before Bakery on Maple becomes a memory."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latest letter begins, "It is with profound sadness that we must announce that are closing up earlier than expected. The cost to stay open is just too much and we need to save what we have for our customer orders that are confirmed."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bakery announced via Facebook in January that it was experiencing financial problems, especially with its over-the-counter sales, a critical component of its business model. The announcement was met with an outpouring of support that allowed the bakery to remain open while it considered its options.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The store front and retail sales were not only part of a financial model but also part of a social vision that was intended to promote a safe public space for anyone and everyone. </p>

<p>A week and a half ago, the bakery announced that it would be closing its store front with a letter that is still posted on the door.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bakery, the letter informed patrons, will be reformed under Black Sheep Baking Co. and focus on a combination of subscription sales and small wholesale accounts.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
