<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Legion baseball team has used small-ball tactics over the past to pummel several quality opponents.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Sunday afternoon, the program from Simsbury turned the tables, going station to station and base to base to cobble together a 10-1 victory from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Simsbury’s first win (1-3) while Bristol fell to 1-1-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury pitcher Evan Odegard (complete game, one run, three hits, five Ks) wasn’t overpowering but let his defense make plays behind him, earning the win in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad scored at least one run over the second and sixth innings as crooked numbers ruled the day for Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Caleb Molinsky (four innings, 69 pitches, four walks, two earned runs) battled, gave up just a half-dozen hits, fanned four while three errors did not help his cause.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I didn’t think Caleb pitched that badly,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “We just played really poor defense. We gave them a lot of extra outs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky allowed two first inning walks but came back to produce a strikeout and pop-up to end the first half-inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Odegard countered, going 1-2-3 in the bottom of the first as the game was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the second, Simsbury went on the attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Matt Fagnant singled to right and when the ball got away from the fielder, the runner took second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nolan Conderino followed with a walk, stole second and the lead runner came home when an offering to third base was booted - allowing Fagnant to score to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with runners on second and third and two outs, JJ Fagnant cleared the bases with a base hit to right, making it a 3-0 contest halfway through the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol got a runner during the bottom of the tilt as the debuting Nick Sconziano walked and then swiped second base to get into scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jose Feliciano then beat out an infield hit to second - putting runners on the corners - and on a botched pickoff play, Sconziano scored from third to trim the deficit to 3-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But off one final strikeout, Simsbury got out of the jam to keep things a two-run game through two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury opened the third with two consecutive base hits and off another miscue, the bases were juiced with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A slick 6-3 double play, cued by Elliot Norris at shortstop, wasn’t enough to get out of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colby Wilhelm and Kyle Anthony came home to score off the double play and from an RBI single by Matt Fagnant as Simsbury roped up a 5-1 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The game should have been much closer than it was in the beginning,” said LaPenta. “We just didn’t play well defensively at all.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury added to its tally in the fourth as a double steal saw Jackson Moore come home from third to give the visiting aggression a 6-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio earned a one-out hit in the bottom of the fourth, but a 4-3 double play erased the runners as Simsbury ended the fifth frame ahead by five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hit a few balls hard on the nose,” said LaPenta. “[But] they were right at guys. They got a couple bloopers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 turned to Gavin Colvin on the hill to open the fifth frame, but Simsbury remained aggressive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With runners on second and third, a wild pitch scored Charles Orluk and Matt Fagnant dropped a slow roller by second base as the RBI tally scored Odegard to increase the Simsbury cushion to 8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, Jose Feliciano absolutely crushed a ball towards the line in left, earning a double ,but pinch runner Mike Roalf never advanced as Simsbury took its seven-run lead into the sixth inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth, Odegard slammed a double by Jayden Churchill in center for an RBI and he scored when Matt Fagnant cracked a single to right - making the event a 10-1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feliciano came in to pitch for Bristol in the top of the seventh, walking two, but not letting Simsbury add another run to the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Odegard retired 10 of the final 12 batters he faced as Simsbury scored a nine-run victory on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Once we got behind, it kind of just sucked all the life out of us,” said LaPenta. “I didn’t expect to go undefeated, so we have to rebound tomorrow [against Northeast]."</p>
