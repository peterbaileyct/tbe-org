<p>The field is set for both high school boys and girls basketball championships from Mohegan Sun Arena this weekend.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some brackets ended up in complete surprise while others, like boys Division I play, came down to the top two teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no matter how it's sliced, Uncasville is going to see 10 huge championship games starting on Saturday at 10:30 a.m.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incredibly, eight No. 1 seeds are still in the mix for a state title as 80 percent of the teams in the championship bouts were the best in their class this season.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the only bracket that truly has a Cinderella story is in Class S as the top seed left standing is ranked 10 overall.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s look at the championship line-up for both boys and girls hoop as the winter scholastic schedule comes to a completion this weekend:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys&nbsp;</strong>– Records do not include conference postseason tournaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division I – March 18, 8:15 p.m. (Championship game time)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 East Catholic (22-1) versus No. 2 Northwest Catholic&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>It’s a showdown between last season’s CIAC Division I champ (East Catholic) against the Division II runner-up (Northwest Catholic). Both teams are schools of choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division II – March 19, 6:15 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 St. Bernard (21-3) vs. No. 7 Staples (19-5)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Neither one of the Division II finalists were in the division this year. Both Bristol Central (6-15) and Northwest Catholic moved up to Division I play due to recent success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division III – March 19, 3 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Bloomfield (20-2) vs. No. 2 Waterbury Career Academy (20-2)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Bloomfield was the Division VI champion last season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division IV – March 19, 10 a.m.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Cromwell (21-2) vs. No. 3 Ellington (20-3)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Ellington defeated No. 10 Seymour in Farmington on Wednesday night, 58-41. Seymour defeated No. 23 Bristol Eastern (65-43) in first-round play.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division V – March 18 – 12:30 p.m.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 1 Windsor Locks (20-3) versus No. 6 Shepaug (17-6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Incredibly, all No. 1 seeds in boys tournament play are in the finals. It’s highly unusual but that’s where we’re at in 2023. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls&nbsp;</strong>– Records do not include conference postseason tournaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 4 Marcy (18-5) versus No. 6 New London (17-6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, a number one seed did not make it to the finals. No. 1 Northwestern was bounced by No. 8 Daniel Hand 54-51 on March 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class S</strong><strong>&nbsp;– March 18, 10 a.m.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class SS&nbsp;– March 18, 3 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the complete 2022-23 title field in what should be another tremendous championship weekend from Mohegan Sun Arena.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
