<p>BRISTOL - Over a four-day stretch, the Bristol Central wrestling program hit the mats three times.</p>

<p>It was one heck of a stretch for the Rams but a rewarding one for the locals.</p>

<p>After flipping Maloney on Wednesday, Central then wrangled up a 48-27 victory over Plainville in a CCC South tilt from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol on Friday.</p>

<p>The Rams defeated the Spartans by a 55-12 final two days previous and the victory over the Blue Devils pushed the Bristol squad to 4-0 overall and 3-0 in CCC South action.</p>
