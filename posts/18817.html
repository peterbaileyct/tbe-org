<p>BRISTOL – Just over twenty years ago, the annual Bristol city series cross country meet between Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern and St. Paul was a good one as both the boys and girls races were extremely competitive from Rockwell Park. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was just before the time when the boys program at Central began to dominate the meet year after year and on that fateful day, the Rams were still the best team of the bunch. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was able to topple Eastern 27-30 while the Rams also spun St. Paul 16-39. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern defeated St. Paul 16-39 as well. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, Eastern stud Eric Garren won the race, taking a quick edge and never looking back. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His time of 17:42 was a great finish for the Lancers. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were energized,” said Garren to Michael Letendre that afternoon. “We had the energy going. It hurts we lost. Win or lose, we’re champions.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had a slew of harriers finish after the crafty Garren. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tom Cyr (18:05) was the runner up, hoopster Mike Cifone (18:30) nabbed fourth place while Sean Rogers (fifth, 18:34) and Mike Niedzwiecki (sixth, 18:43) made big gains over the course of the event. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern also had its share of top finishers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In third place was Justin Garren (18:25), another slick racer for the Kingstreeters, along Tommy O’Connor (19:02) and Tony D’Amato (19:10) who helped keep the Lancers afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul’s Chris Baylor crossed the finish line in 20:08. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls side, Central’s Jillian Sullivan continued to crush the course record at Rockwell Park - winning the city series contest in 19:38 which was over 64 seconds better than her previous best effort. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third time she broke the Rockwell Park course standard that season. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Central won the team race by a 21-36 final over Eastern and snared a 17-38 triumph versus St. Paul. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jillian was awesome,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford. “I expected her to do well but [breaking the course record] was a nice surprise.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was her fourth city series championship out of four tries. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, Sullivan was extremely pleased in seizing the top prize one more time. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I felt good,” said Sullivan. “I’m really happy I broke the course record by a minute.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Randi Ferguson nabbed the runner up spot (22:28) while Alyse Phoenix finished in third place (22:43). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Erin Pepper (23:00) earned fifth place for the victors.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
