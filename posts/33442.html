<p>Former Bristol Central boys basketball standout Jayeson VanBeveren certainly has the ability to compete at the next level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During his senior season, the forward/center put together a great final scholastic campaign and because of that, the student-athlete had some choices to make in terms of furthering his basketball education.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming year, VanBeveren is joining an outstanding program at Mitchell College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren, who blossomed at Central under head coach Tim Barrette as a senior, displayed an invaluable inside-outside game and ended up leading the program in several key categories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s not counting the leadership component he brought to every game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette was extra tough on VanBeveren all season long and it all paid off in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m tough on Jay,” said Barrette after Central defeated Tolland this past year. “I told the guys in the locker room ‘if you think I yell a lot at you, I yell at Jay more than anyone because I expect the most out of Jay.'”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior delivered just about every night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren could finish at the hoop or hit long bombs from deep, keeping opponents busy over thirty-two minutes of hardwood warfare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That kind of versatility made him an extremely valuable contributor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, VanBeveren dropped in a team-leading 12.9 points-per-game and was capable of scoring 20 points when called upon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up third on the team in three-pointers made with 21 and second on the squad in free throws made (25) behind Carmelo Thompson (29).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He netted 258 points overall and was the only player on the squad to play in all 21 games as Central went 6-15 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ schedule was intense last season as the squad took on several heavyweights over both Division I and II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents ended up zoning in on VanBeveren due to the loss of fellow senior Julius Powell via injury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren helped Central to a .500 record through 10 games before a midseason slump - against some quality opponents - derailed the campaign a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, VanBeveren never lost his focus, and the outstanding young man was an invaluable role player on Central’s 2021-22 championship team (refer to my book ‘Dream Team’ to read about his contribution to the championship season) the previous season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played in 26 of 28 games as a junior and that experience helped him immensely as a senior with Central attempting to make up for 97-percent of its scoring it lost due to the graduation of Donovan Clingan, Damion Glasper, Victor Rosa, Steve Alseph and Carson Rivoira.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Central’s first victory of the year at Tolland on December 19, VanBeveren notched 14 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and drained two big 3s to help the Rams to a 58-45 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in the season, he was averaging 15.0 points and 15.7 rebounds-per-game and helped carry Central through stretches of games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Middletown, he collected 21 points and 17 rebounds in a 63-46 loss while collecting 13 point, 11 rounds, five assists and rejecting four shots in the 46-32 win against South Windsor in the consolation game of the BC Holiday Classic to end the month of December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren nabbed 18 points and seven rebounds in Central’s 50-41 come-from-behind win over Plainville on January 3 - hitting 5-of-6 free throws late in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He added 14 points and seven rebounds in a tough loss against East Catholic and helped his squad get revenge against Bristol Eastern on February 20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior was outstanding with 16 points, 19 rebounds and four blocks as the Rams won 59-52 - splitting the season series against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all that outstanding play caught the eye of the scouts at Mitchell College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mitchell is an NCAA Division III program out of New London, a member of the GNAC division, and a very good program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mariners went a sterling 23-5 overall in 2022-23 - going a perfect 15-0 at home last season.</p>
