<h2 class="wp-block-heading">State officials warn against potential government imposter scam</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut businesses have been the target of an&nbsp;ongoing potential government imposter scam, according to a release from Attorney General William Tong, Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas, Commissioner of Banking Jorge Perez, and Commissioner of Consumer Protection Bryan T. Cafferelli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this scheme, a company called CT UCC Statement Service, attempts to get businesses to pay $90 for a copy of a Uniform Commercial Code report. While the solicitation is designed to look like a government notice, this company has no affiliation with the State of Connecticut. In fact, UCC reports may be accessed for free via the Secretary of the State’s website at&nbsp;<a href="http://business.ct.gov/">business.ct.gov</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the company notes in small print that they are “not affiliated with any state or government agency” and that businesses are not required to use their services, such a disclaimer may not be sufficient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To report a scam or instance of fraud to the Office of the Attorney General, please file a complaint online here: https://www.dir.ct.gov/ag/complaint.</p>
