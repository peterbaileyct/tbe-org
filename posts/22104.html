<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Central wrestling team has been moving right along during the 2022-23 wrestling campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Wednesday evening in Meriden, it was another sterling victory for the Rams’ squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting another outstanding all-around team effort, Central moved to 9-1 overall as the program downed a very good team from Maloney by a 39-28 final from Francis T. Maloney High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams moved to 3-1 overall in CCC South competition with the lone setback coming against Berlin early in the season.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans gave the team from Bristol all it could handle but, in the end, the locals earned several key pins and nabbed critical decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>At 113 pounds, Central’s Kaden Dragon was able to pin Angela White in just over a minute (104) while in the 120 class, Joseph Nick was a 7-0 decision victor over Nicholas Rodriguez.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Julian Colon (126 pounds) went the distance against Daren Johnson in racking up a 4-1 decision and then at 138, Central’s Aiden Lamar blanked Franiel Urena Garcia via a 6-0 decision.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two more pin-falls came Central’s way as Landon Dionne (145) pinned Ezequiel Acevedo in 2:22 and Lincoln Archibald (152) topped Saleem Salih in 3:23 to keep the momentum rolling.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Jayden Colon (182) encountered little resistance in pinning Moises Hernandez - needing just 26 seconds for the fall - while Johnny Rios (195) topped Deshaun Williams with a 57 second pin-fall victory.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have put together a tremendous season, lurking in the top-20 of the state’s rankings and have proved to be a tough out over several weekend competitions and tournaments. </p>
