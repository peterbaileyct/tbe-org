<p>Brian McCutcheon, 64, of Avon, beloved husband and father, passed away surrounded by family on Nov. 3. Born in Bristol on July 24, 1959, he was the son of the late Margaret O’Brien Sullivan and the late Robert McCutcheon. </p>

<p>He grew up in Bristol and was often found at one of the athletic fields in town playing football, baseball, or basketball. He especially enjoyed spending Saturdays at the Forestville Boys Club. Coached by many Bristol legends, his greatest coach was his Uncle George “Yosh” Redman whose steadfast guidance remained with Brian throughout his life. </p>

<p>He attended Bristol schools, graduating from St. Paul Catholic High School in 1977. Soon after, he embarked on a career at McCutcheon Concrete, where he always felt at home driving a mixer. He was a true master at navigating a mixer into the tightest of spaces for a pour or planning out a complex job.</p>

<p>More recently he was employed at United Concrete Products in logistics where he took tremendous pride in recalling details of each job both within Connecticut and throughout the New England and Tri State areas. He was a hard worker who used his wit, ability to problem solve, and sense of humor to ensure any job was well done.</p>

<p>He was an avid music fan and attended countless concerts beginning in his teenage years, but amongst his favorites were the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles, and The Band. He was especially thrilled to be able to bring his boys along for recent concerts performed by some of these groups. He was a passionate sports fan as well who took great satisfaction in a friendly round of sports trivia and always anticipated the next big event. </p>

<p>Family was everything to Brian and he made sure they were cared for and loved. He brought his Irish wit and sense of humor with him everywhere he went, leading to endless laughs and enduring smiles. He made timeless memories with his family on golf trips and vacations including those to Ireland, Florida, Mt. Snow, Vt., and the beaches of Rhode Island. He never missed a birthday or celebration and was a constant presence at sports games and school performances, including many memorable car rides around the Northeast.</p>

<p>He is survived by his wife, Sharon N. McCutcheon, of over 31 years, having met in the summer of 1982. Together, Brian and Sharon raised three boys, Tyler, Connor, and Ian-Patrick, whom Brian loved unconditionally and who were his greatest joy in life. He was most happy being with Sharon and “the boys” and together they cherished each moment and adventure. Brian was incredibly proud to be called “Dad” and never failed to let anyone know he would do it all again in a heartbeat. He is also survived by his two sisters Lisa McCutcheon Casey and her husband David, Jill McCutcheon Brayton and her husband John, his mother-in-law Carol G. Notarangelo, whom he often spent Saturday mornings with going out for coffee and a blueberry muffin from Harvest Bakery, a sister-in-law Carolyn Notarangelo, family friend Nicole Gill, several nieces and cousins, and his “little girl” Tia, who enjoyed her daily rides and treats with Brian. He was followed in death by Eugene F. Sullivan Jr., husband of Brian’s late mother. </p>

<p>Brian will forever be loved, remembered, and missed dearly. His memory can best be honored by time with family, hard work, a good laugh, and an IPA. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
