<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program runs until August 20 and is free to everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This program serves as an introduction to fokstyle (scholastic) wrestling and is designed for children who are new to the sport,” according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is trying to regrow its numbers in the sport as the pandemic decreased participation in wrestling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members of the Gladiator Wrestling Program will help oversee the programs and students can learn from some of the top local talent from in and around Bristol. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Practices will focus on the fundamental skills needed to participate in wrestling. They will be taught in a fun format that will include physical games and skill building exercises, as well as drilling and live wrestling.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first session on July 9 saw thirty kids participate over a great morning of competition.</p>
