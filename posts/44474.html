<p>Bristol Eastern traveled to Palmer Field in Middletown Monday night and put together a complete performance against Middletown. In the Lancers' 5-1 victory, they received great pitching from Declan Schenck, an errorless night in the field, and some timely hitting and baserunning by the rest of the BE nine.</p>

<p>Schenck went the entire seven innings for the win, giving up six hits and one earned run. He struck out eight Blue Dragon batters and walked only one the entire night. He had a perfect mix of fastballs and sharp breaking curves, keeping Middletown off-balance at the plate throughout the game.</p>

<p>Owen Myers had a single and a double for the Lancers, and Mason Harris added two singles and an RBI to the offensive output.</p>

<p>The big inning for Eastern came in the fifth when they scored three runs after two were out. Harris started the rally with a bases empty single. Brayden Schenck followed with a laser single to left. The ball went through the legs of the Middletown left fielder and rolled to the fence. By the time it was retrieved, Harris had scored all the way from first. After Anthony Nocera took a pitch in the ribs, Caleb Molinsky knocked in Schenck with BE's second run, and Nocera then scored on an infield error.</p>
