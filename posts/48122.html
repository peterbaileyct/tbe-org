<p>I was a happy volunteer among many at the Foodshare mobile food distribution on June 28 at the First Congregational Church parking lot on Maple Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The morning started with Rob Sanderford, the church's outreach chair, lining up guests' cars in the parking lot for the 8:30 a.m. start time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was while Rob was volunteering as a tax preparer at the United Way of West Central Connecticut that he was asked about using the parking area for a new Foodshare Mobile distribution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I brought it to the church board," Rob said, "and it was approved to move forward."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rob is joined by Webster Bank and United Way volunteers to direct traffic.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 8:30 a.m. the mobile Foodshare truck arrives with Malik behind the wheel. He opens the truck starts to unload the fruits, vegetables and nutritious drinks we, volunteers, will give out today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Malik runs a smooth operations," a seasoned Foodshare volunteer tells me. I also learn that Malik has been with Foodshare Mobile for two years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am thankful for his kindness and efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, volunteers help unpack the food and arrange it on the tables where guests will choose from the options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next hour as the food is distributed, I learn more about the operation. </p>

<p>Manny Martinez, president of UWWCC has been with the organization for six years, two in Bristol. He is responsible for the addition of Webster Bank and CT Chambers of Commerce volunteers. </p>

<p>I learned that it is a required part of the Webster Bank employee performance plan to be involved with volunteer events like this with Foodshare Mobile and the United Way of West Central Connecticut in Bristol.</p>

<p>There are many volunteer opportunities available at the United Way of West Central Connecticut in Bristol, such as the the Adopt-a-Child Back-to-School collection of backpacks and school supplies for K-8 students in Bristol, Plymouth, Plainville and Burlington schools.</p>

<p>I learned from Holly Bishop, Foodshare Mobile volunteer training coordinator, that there were 90 guests at this location, the third visit this summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also said there are 180 CT Foodshare mobile trucks in the state, and there were 26,000 guests last month." There are four Bristol Foodshare Mobile locations. </p>

<p>Sarah Mitchell, United Way personnel coordinator, said, “Partnering with community agencies like Foodshare mobile and nonprofits like United Way of Bristol can bring us together to help churches like First Church of Christ Congregational, to reach out, give back, meet new people, and help people locally.”</p>

<p>This Foodshare mobile distribution takes place every two weeks on Friday morning from 8:30 a.m. until 9:15 a.m. The next distribution is on July 12 at First Church of Christ Congregational of Bristol at 31 Maple St.</p>
