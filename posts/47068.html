<p>This past weekend, several&nbsp;current players and graduates&nbsp;from the Bristol Soccer Club travel&nbsp;program proudly&nbsp;represented Connecticut&nbsp;in the prestigious&nbsp;U.S. Youth Soccer&nbsp;Olympic Development Program (ODP) where they were able to showcase their&nbsp;dedication, skill, and passion for the game&nbsp;at the 2024 East Regional Tournament in Hammonton, New Jersey. From Virginia to Maine,&nbsp;15 states competed&nbsp;at the highest regional soccer level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Connecticut ODP program&nbsp;is run by the Connecticut Junior Soccer Association (CJSA), and it&nbsp;serves as a pathway for elite youth soccer players to showcase their abilities at regional and national levels. It offers a structured curriculum and top-notch coaching, providing players with the tools they need to compete at the highest levels of the sport. For the girls from Bristol, this program has been instrumental in honing their talents and&nbsp;their&nbsp;development&nbsp;as soccer players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the key elements of the ODP program is its emphasis on holistic development. Beyond technical skills and tactical awareness, the program instills values such as teamwork, discipline, and resilience in its participants.&nbsp;Throughout the year, these young athletes participate in various regional tournaments, where they face off against some of the best&nbsp;competition&nbsp;the Northeast has to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Natalia Assis is finishing 6<sup>th</sup> grade at West Bristol School. She got her soccer start at the Bristol Soccer Club and currently plays for the Bristol Strikers U12 travel team and recently joined the Elite Clubs National League team (this is the highest level of play in CT)at the Farmington Sports Academy (FSA). As a U12 this was her first year with ODP and she was invited to each Regional and scored 2 goals for Team CT 1 which had a 5 and 2 record. Natalia is a forward/striker with great speed, foot skills and a talent for finding the ball and passing. </p>

<p>Bria Rossi is entering her eighth-grade year at Greene-Hills school. The 2024 season is Bria’s first with ODP, where she is one of the forwards for the 2011 (members born in 2011) team. When not on the pitch with ODP, you can find her playing with her Valley Football Club or Bristol Soccer Club teams. While her combination of strength, speed, and physicality give her plenty of scoring opportunities, it is her selfless attitude that allows her to find open teammates, making her a powerful weapon. Her relentless attack mentality supply her teams’ offense, and her knowledge and comfort with the game allow her to help defensively, whenever called upon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Maliyah Douglas is entering her sophomore year at Kingswood Oxford School where she played forward and attacking midfielder as a starting freshman scoring 5 goals in her first high school season. Maliyah started her soccer experience at the age of 6 with the Bristol Soccer Club and then played for Bristol travel until her 8th grade year. She will continue her premiere soccer experience on CFC North with the 2009 Elite girls team this upcoming season. Being the versatile player she is, Maliyah started and played the entire length of all three 2024 ODP East Regionals games as a center back with numerous headers, tackles and blocks to then provide connecting passes to her teammates for shots and goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alaina Joy is currently a Freshman at Bristol Eastern and will be transferring to Kent School this upcoming Fall. Although this is Alaina’s first year joining CT ODP as a Center Back for the 2009 team she has been playing since the age of 3, when she joined the Bristol Soccer Club’s&nbsp;Dinomites&nbsp;program.&nbsp;She&nbsp;is a graduate of&nbsp;the Bristol Lightning Bolts&nbsp;travel team&nbsp;and&nbsp;has&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;play most field positions, but her strength&nbsp;is&nbsp;on the defensive line. Alaina&nbsp;is&nbsp;an extremely strong player not only with her ability to play, but also her communication. Her directional headers and fierceness kept the ball in the attack for the majority of all three games.&nbsp;<br></p>
