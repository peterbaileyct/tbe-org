<p>Mike Lorenzetti - the former Bristol Central pitching sensation - could cause Iona College men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino to do a double take when the nearly 6-foot-8 athlete hits his campus in 2022-23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitino might think Lorenzetti is primed and ready to start at small forward position for Iona but that’s not going to happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is Mike Lorenzetti, the baseball player (not Travis Knight, Rick) and the chucker is ready to take another step in his playing career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti will indeed be attending Iona next year as he recently signed his National Letter of Intent to play baseball for the Gales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Iona is getting a good one, assuming he’s not drafted between his post-graduate season at Taft and hitting the diamond in New York for Iona.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Iona is a Catholic school in New Rochelle and should be a tremendous fit for Lorenzetti, an outstanding young man who should thrive playing NCAA Division I baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I want to thank my parents for sticking by my side through my entire baseball journey,” said Lorenzetti via Twitter. “I’d also like to thank (Taft coach Mike) Mastrocola for all his hard work and (Iona) coach (Conor) Burke for this amazing opportunity. I’m excited and honored to announce my commitment to Iona College.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Lorenzetti’s long time coach at Taft in Watertown knows exactly what Iona is getting in the form of Lorenzetti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Huge congrats to Mike on his commitment to Iona where he will help Coach Burke and the Gales fight for MAAC championships!,” tweeted Taft baseball on the day of Lorenzetti’s signing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taft coaches have mentioned that Lorenzetti is not just a competitor, but a work horse who is always improving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His speed on his fastball isn’t any secret as he can reach into the low 90’s in terms of mph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scouts have commented on his 6-foot-8, 200 pound frame that he throws with serious plane.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti has a curveball he can unleash, a good slider, and during this past summer for the Bristol American Legion baseball program, the chucker threw a couple three and four inning no-hitters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next summer, Lorenzetti will be playing for the Westfield Starfires of the Future Collegiate Baseball League.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after his stint in the FCBL, it’s off to Iona in the next step of Lorenzetti’s baseball education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“After visiting the school, an offer was made that he felt was the best fit for him,” said his dad James Lorenzetti of Iona.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if a former Boston Celtics coach starts taking a look at a certain 6-foot-8 giant on the baseball diamond, someone should tell Pitino to look somewhere else for help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That would make Pitino 0-for-2 in attempting to lure players away from Bristol to play hoop at Iona.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But starting this fall, Lorenzetti is going to be a perfect fit for the Gales and playing some serious NCAA Division I baseball.</p>
