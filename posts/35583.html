<p>The Bristol Child Development Center (BCDC) will be able to enroll 16 additional children and add five new positions, as well as more classroom space among other improvements, with an American Rescue Plan Act (APRA) grant from the City of Bristol in the amount of $275,000.</p>

<p>“These transformative changes we have been able to achieve through APRA funding, have allowed us to provide toddler care at our West Street location,” said Maegan Adams, BCDC executive director of operations. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With the opening of the two toddler classrooms, we have been able to instantly fill the spaces as the need for affordable toddler care is significantly high. We will see the impact of opening these rooms for years to come,” she said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ARPA funding will assist with the expansion of a toddler classroom, the addition of a new toddler playground and the upgrade of a preschool playground.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recent ARPA funding allowed the BCDC to convert one large preschool classroom into two toddler classrooms. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grant also funded new safe outdoor play space for toddlers, as well as a new preschool playground which is easier for staff to clean and sanitize to help with COVID mitigation efforts.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the ARPA funding provided the Bristol Child Development Center with the ability to enroll 16 new children and add an additional five new employees to the BCDC staff.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The City of Bristol utilized an innovative process to allow businesses and nonprofits to put forth transformative projects in vying for the City’s allocation of ARPA funding,” Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The new classrooms and play areas at the Bristol Child Development Center will allow them to meet the demand for toddler care which will provide children and families with opportunities that the BCDC may not have otherwise been able to provide.” </p>

<p>Bristol Child Development Center has been serving Bristol’s preschool community and their families since 1971. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
