<p>The week of April 10-14 the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its opening with free museum admission. In addition, a variety of activities are being planned as well as special videos on view. </p>

<p>The museum opened its doors April 10, 1954, at the first institution in the nation dedicated to horology, the science of measuring time and the art of making instruments that measure time. Since its opening to the public, the main museum ahs expanded to 10,000 square feet of exhibit space and collection space now boast over 10,000 items, from clocks to watches to photographs as well as archive space, according to the release announcing the anniversary.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to these activities, there will be video programs playing continuously, Friday through Sunday, and two special exhibitions—"Seth Thomas: Clocks for Every Need" and "70 Objects for 70 Years." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the recent installation of the museum’s Seth Thomas post clock, the exhibit is an opportunity to learn a bit about the company’s history and the wide variety of items it produced. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The "70 Objects for 70 Years" cabinet of curiosities exhibit is a nod to every museum’s struggle to avoid displaying unrelated items together in a haphazard manner, affording the museum the opportunity to dive into its artifacts and display the more curious items that have been collected over the past 70 years.</p>

<p>Free admissions to the public for the week were made available by sponsor Thomaston Savings Bank.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
