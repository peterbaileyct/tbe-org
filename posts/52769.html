<p>The Lancers scored first at 17:03 of the first half as Leslie Adzo sent a pass down the left side that Ledio Thanasi collected and cut towards the Ram goal.&nbsp; His left-footed shot went into the upper corner of Central’s goal for a 1-0 lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Tonight we had some solid combinations and great finishes,” said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; “On the defensive end, we were able to contain Central’s attack, and especially the dangerous Rafael Antonio Jr.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though the Lancers led 2-0, the Rams came out hard in the second half.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eastern withstood their attack for the first twenty minutes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Edy Hernandez, Drew Viens, Landon Gawel, and Alex Szynal worked hard in the final third and didn’t let the Rams get a clean look at the goal,” said Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s third goal came off Tylicky’s second assist.&nbsp; He won the ball just over mid- field, beat a defender and sent a perfectly-paced ball to a cutting Adzo on the right side.&nbsp; &nbsp;Adzo took the ball cleanly and sent a hard, low shot inside the far side of the Central goal at 24:32.</p>

<p>Lancers’ goalie Connor Murtaugh was once again steady in the goal,&nbsp;making 7 saves.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Central keeper James Palma made 4 saves.</p>
