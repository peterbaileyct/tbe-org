<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event will bring Shadow Lugia as part of 5-star Shadow raids and Shadow Cresselia as part of Giovanni's Special Research. Players will also be able to get Shadow variants of Timburr, Tirtouga, and Archen by battling Team GO Rocket Grunts. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, other raids will also feature the Shadow variants of Mareep, Wooper, Cranidos, Shieldon, Nuzleaf, Manectric and Vibrava. During this event, you can remove the Charged Move, Frustration, from your Pokémon and teach it a brand-new move!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every team GO Rocket takeover event debuts a new powerful Legendary Shadow Pokémon into the game. For the Adventure Week takeover, that debut will be Shadow Cresselia. This Shadow Cresselia is through a new Special Research story that will be available when the event starts. Progress through it to receive a Super Rocket Radar and chase down Giovanni!</p>

<p>You can claim this Special Research until the end of Pokémon GO: Shared Skies on Sept. 3, at 9:59 a.m.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
