<p>BRISTOL – In Bristol, we love our Thanksgiving Day football clash when the programs from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern lock horns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s usually an exciting game and chance to see some of Bristol’s top athletes clash on the beautiful grass field over at Muzzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always a treat on Turkey Day and a tradition unlike any others in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are fortunate to be able to witness such a rivalry game, year in and year out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what would happen if that series was taken away from us or moved to a date other than Thanksgiving?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would the game mean the same if it were played on the Saturday before the holiday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or maybe pushed back a day to Wednesday like several other programs in the state have?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s something to consider: If you have an exciting rivalry game, which is usually the biggest event of the season played at Muzzy Field, why would you mess up that historic contest?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why the talk of expanded playoffs by the CIAC is always a threat to muck around the BC/BE clash on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, even as the playoff format has eight teams qualify over six divisions, starting the state tournament after the Thanksgiving Day holiday has worked out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, it’s cold in late November and early December to start those playoff quarterfinal rounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what’s the alternative?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not being able to see the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern football teams duke it out on Thanksgiving would completely change the holiday for us in the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the excitement of Thanksgiving Day football in Bristol is a tradition all of its own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central coach Jeff Papazian does not want to see the Thanksgiving Day clash in the city moved or eliminated due to an expanded state tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s talk and it comes up every year,” said Papazian about Thanksgiving Day football and the playoffs. “[The CIAC] wants to expand the playoffs and get rid of Thanksgiving. But I speak for my own team. For a team like us, you get a Super Bowl [on Thanksgiving] every year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tradition must stand for something and moving or not playing the Thanksgiving Day game in town – just to expand the playoffs – wouldn’t be something many people in Bristol would be in favor of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First off, making the playoffs in football every season is not a given.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol for instance, the Central and Eastern programs have never been in the state tournament during the same school year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the two squads have made the playoffs a combined six times while Eastern won the Class MM title back in 1988 and is Bristol’s only football championship to date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not a swipe against either program but it simply illustrates that giving away the game on Thanksgiving wouldn’t be such a great idea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And how much further would the CIAC want to dilute the playoff pool?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would the CIAC entertain a state tournament field of 12 (allowing for four first round byes) or 16 teams for all six classes?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would that truly look like?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about the postseason picture now, with eight teams in the mix over six divisions?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is a .500 record, or something close to it in football, not worthy enough for a postseason bid?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, November 22, what was the record of the current eighth place program in all three divisions?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class LL – Glastonbury (8-2 overall)</strong>. But the ninth-place team, Ridgefield, was 4-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L – New Milford (6-3).</strong> One spot down was Shelton (5-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class MM – Platt (6-3). </strong>The next three teams (Guilford, Wilton and Edwin O. Smith) all just had three losses apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class M – Branford (4-5).</strong> The four teams in back of Branford all had five losses as well, meaning (at least) one program with a .500 record will be competing over postseason play in 2022 with just five wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class SS – Gilbert/Northwest/Housatonic (7-2). </strong>Ninth ranked Valley/Old Lyme was 8-1 and in good shape for a possible tournament bid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class S – Haddam Killingworth (6-3). </strong>North Branford (5-4) was just a spot behind in ninth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not sure what the exact playoff expansion, if any, would look like but how many .500 and sub-.500 teams would the CIAC want in state tournament play?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current set-up seems to be fair enough in terms of teams though a .500 record in football might be missing the mark for a postseason jaunt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about studying this latest format and see how it pans out before making a major overhaul which could include the elimination of Thanksgiving Day football in Connecticut?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because ruining a football tradition in town, dating back to 1959, shouldn’t be on anyone’s docket in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it ain’t broke, you know the rest.</p>
