<p>BRISTOL - When Bristol Central girls basketball standout Lillian Sirois transferred across town from St. Paul, she joined a squad that was in the midst of a long losing streak against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she entered this season as the Lancers were on a <em>34-game winning streak </em>over the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t a streak started by any of the current players on either roster but Sirois and her teammates were the group to end all that bad luck against the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And behind an incredible 55-42 victory over Eastern, Sirois and company broke the hex last Saturday in an amazing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels beyond great because I just transferred here [from St. Paul] this year,” said Lillian Sirois. “So I wasn’t sure if I was going to play basketball. And then I decided to play and we came out here and I said, ‘guys, no one wants to lose a game. No one wants this.’ I [told them] work hard, we’ve got this.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It just feels great.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in a career-high 25 points as she notched at least four points in every quarter against the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over an amazing display, Sirois and Ariana Rivera - who scored 17 points - never let the Lancers into the game after the Rams grabbed the edge late in the first period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just wanted to win,” said Sirois. “I was just tired of hearing about since [2004], Eastern’s better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sirois is legit as she attacks the hoop with zest, can hit the long bomb from time to time, and is one of the squad’s impressive leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sirois started the campaign averaging 17.4 points-per-game over her first five games and has never relented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crosstown games never go as expected and it was just a matter of time before the Rams to finally tallied a win over the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s never an easy situation when dealing with a long losing streak, just ask the Bristol Central volleyball squad in its battles against Bristol Eastern since 1994.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was something different about this Central girls basketball squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is an athletic bunch, can finish at the hoop, and were all on the same page against the Lancers - beating the press, hitting its layups, and shot over 50-percent from the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We all wanted to win,” said Sirois. “We all just worked together, communicated and knew we had to work as a team. It’s just my senior year so I had to finish it out with a bang.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now Central is surging after a tough 0-7 start and getting a victory over Eastern proves that anything is possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are averaging over 50 points-per-game over their last five contests - leading to five straight victories with several more to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we’ve had our losses for the rest of the season,” said Sirois. “From here on out, it’s just up. There’s no more down.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>RIM DUST…</strong>It was erroneously reported that Central broke a 32-game losing streak against Eastern with that 13-point win. The last victory for the Rams against the Lancers came back on February 16, 2004 in a 60-57 victory. From there, it’s been 17 years in-between wins. At two games a season over 17 years, it led to 34 straight wins for BE. That wrong tally caught wildfire in other publications as well. Does anyone do their homework these days?!?</p>
