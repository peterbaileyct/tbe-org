<h2 class="wp-block-heading">High school seniors encouraged to apply for state's automatic college admission program</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jan. 4, 2024, deadline for eligible high school seniors to be automatically admitted to participating Connecticut colleges and universities by filling out one application available at no cost was the subject of a news conference in New Britain yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gov. Ned Lamont joined Connecticut State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) Chancellor Terrence Cheng and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene M. Russell-Tucker at New Britain High School to encourage eligible high school seniors in Connecticut to apply for the Connecticut Automatic Admission Program, which launched recently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deadline to apply is for high school seniors who are graduating this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Graduating seniors in the top 30 percent of their class – as identified by their individual high school counselors – are eligible, according to the press release from the governor's office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By simplifying the admissions process and removing application fees, the goal is to make it easier for high school students to seek higher education, particularly among first-generation, low-income, and minority students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is administered by CSCU in partnership with the nonprofit organization Common App. This becomes the first state and nonprofit partnership on automatic admission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The colleges and universities currently participating include the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Central Connecticut State University in New Britain</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Western Connecticut State University in Danbury</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Mitchell College in New London</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>University of Bridgeport in Bridgeport</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>University of New Haven in New Haven</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>University of St. Joseph in West Hartford</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Goodwin University in East Hartford</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the most recent round of applications that ended in October, a total of 2,266 students applied, totaling 18,128 offers of automatic admission to participating institutions – as each student received eight offers each. In 2022, there were 1,617 applications, so the program's applications have already surpassed first-year participation levels.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thousands of old, low-level convictions set to be automatically erased over the next month </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than 80,000 people will have convictions for older, lower-level offenses cleared from their record over the next month, it was announced by Gov. Ned Lamont in a release yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process to erase the vast majority of eligible records is expected to be completed by the end of January 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approximately 28,752 additional convictions for operation while under the influence, for which Clean Slate eligibility was modified in the 2023 legislative session, are expected to be erased by the end of March 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, another group of approximately 62,364 convictions will require manual confirmation due to imperfections in historical data. Those convictions will be processed manually over the course of the first half of 2024.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The erasure of these old, low-level convictions comes in addition to the 43,754 low-level drug possession (mostly cannabis) convictions that the state already erased&nbsp;earlier this year with the law that legalized and safely regulates the adult-use of cannabis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is expected that the system will initially identify for erasure approximately 178,499 offenses from more than 80,000 people. Record erasure does not mean deletion or destruction; instead, erasure causes a record to be flagged for nondisclosure to anyone other than the clerk holding the records.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eligible offenses include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Any classified or unclassified misdemeanor (imprisonment less than one year), with a seven-year waiting period from the person’s most recent conviction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Class D, E, or unclassified felonies (imprisonment less than five years), or operating under the influence (General Statutes § 14-227a), with a 10-year waiting period from the person’s most recent conviction.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be automatically erased, the offense must have been committed on or after Jan. 1, 2000. Earlier offenses may be erased via a petition to the courts under similar eligibility rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some specific charges are excluded from erasure, as is any sexually violent offense and nonviolent sexual offense. Any offense designated as a family violence crime is also excluded. Convictions cannot be erased on a person’s record unless the person has no pending criminal charges and the person has completed all periods of incarceration, probation, and parole imposed since Jan. 1, 2000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the most common felonies to be erased are burglary in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;degree, larceny in the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;degree, and forgery in the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;degree. Some of the most common misdemeanors to be erased are larceny in the 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;degree (shoplifting), DUI and failure to appear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-279(c) imposed between Jan. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2015, were automatically erased at the beginning of 2023. People who meet those criteria do not need to do anything to have those convictions erased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Convictions for any of the following violations can be erased by petitioning the court:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-279 for possession of less than or equal to 4 ounces of a cannabis-type substance imposed before Jan. 1, 2000, and between Oct. 1, 2015, and June 30, 2021.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-267(a) for possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia for cannabis imposed before July 1, 2021.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Convictions for violations of Connecticut General Statutes § 21a-277(b) imposed before July 1, 2021, for manufacturing, selling, possessing with intent to sell or giving or administering to another person a cannabis-type substance and the amount involved was less than or equal to four ounces or six plants grown inside your home for personal use.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New eligibility levels will allow nearly 10,000 additional people to receive SNAP benefits</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut residents now qualify for Connecticut’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) if their monthly gross income is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (for example, $2,430 for a single person and $5,000 for a four-person household).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until October 2022, Connecticut’s limit was 185 percent of the federal poverty level ($2,248 for a single person and $4,625 for a four-person household). according to the announcement. The federal government allows monthly gross income limits up to 200 percent and Connecticut is now one of approximately 15 states to take full advantage of that allowance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SNAP enrollees are issued electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, which work like a debit card and are replenished for every month of eligibility. The cards can be used at thousands of participating food markets and grocery stores, convenience stores, farmers markets, and online at many retailers for food items approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service.</p>
