<p>Verifying today is Monday. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we call today’s date X.<br>For all x that occurs in a month y in 2024 where dy/d5(5y) = 5,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>then</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If x = 7n + 3 - (1/infinityn), where n = 0 to 4,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>and time t &gt; 17 h after tmax of (x - 1),</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>then we verify with some certainty that today is Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, as for the current time...</p>

<p>Dear CNBC:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hear lots of chatter on your channel about countries defaulting on their debt.&nbsp;This sounds really bad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since we want to be part of the solution and not the problem, we would like to offer a solution. Our solution is that countries do not default.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want us to be on a talk panel and talk about not defaulting, let us know.&nbsp; We can be reached at the below address day or night. Mostly at night, since that is where we sleep.&nbsp; We usually work during the day unless we have it off in which case we are there.&nbsp; Otherwise, we're not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>

<p>The Wetlands On-Site Inspection, 5 p.m. Rockwell Park, Assessor’s Map 11, Lot 208. </p>

<p>Homina! Homina! Homina! If that doesn't get your civic curiosity going nothing will. Sadly, the GMB staff cannot attend because we must check the expiration dates on our tissue boxes.</p>
