<p>One of the main orders of business at the monthly Board of Police Commissioners meeting was the progress being made towards two memorials for the fallen officers, Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One is looking to be placed directly in front of the police station and the final plans are expected to be presented at next month's meeting. The other one is being planned for a site out in front of Muzzy Field and potential funders are planning to scope out the sign soon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The commissioners met on Tuesday, May 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The awards committee promoted the upcoming Officer of the Year event coming up on June 28. Five-hundred and fifty tickets have already been sold. Tickets are available online.</p>

<p>While there was nothing particular to add to the monthly traffic division report, Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano did bring up some major plans for Shrub Road. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city has worked with the United States Postal Service to move 18 mailboxes to the homeowner side of the road on Shrub Road, he said, something that has been long awaited from that community.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The public participation portion of the night saw two presentations from the community. Joyce Ptak, who represents a Mum Festival planning committee, proposed the use of a very special officer for the Bristol marquee tent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The officer in question is the new police dog, Frankie, and Ptak was invited to coordinate the effort with a member of the Police Dept.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other presentation came in the form of a video sent over by the Bristol Boys and Girls club to thank the Bristol Police Department for everything that they do for them. It showcased many videos and pictures set to music of various officers interacting with the kids during various events.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entire board expressed overwhelming support and gratitude for the Boys and Girls Club for all of their continued work with them.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
