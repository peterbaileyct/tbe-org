<p>Hi, all. How was your weekend? The staff of GMB went to Christmas parties and some flew away for a short vacation. Details to follow.</p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today will be a great day for a walk. There will be partial sunshine with a high of 47 and the winds will be from SSW at 5-10 m.p.h. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since some staff have abandoned the ship this week, it will be up to the rest of us to soldier on. </p>

<h3>Party central</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the above-mentioned Christmas party, the entertainment was provided by two Bristol legends, Al Caruso and Rich Theriault. At the age of 95, Caruso still plays the keyboard like a pro. And Rich Theriault, long-time city music teacher and conductor of the Bristol Brass and Wind Ensemble, combined with his friend to cover the entire Christmas music catalogue with flair.</p>

<p>The food was excellent as usual, and the desserts were awesome. There were so many leftovers that there was not enough room in the fridge, so some dessert had to be stored on the back porch. A certain neighborhood resident tried to steal a cheesecake, and the police have been notified.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He claims he is innocent, but we caught him red-handed, or red-pawed, if you prefer. Here he is casing out the situation.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
