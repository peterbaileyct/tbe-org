<p>MERIDEN -- The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team ambushed the program from Platt on Monday afternoon – capturing a satisfying 5-0 victory from Platt High School in Meriden. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second good effort in a row by the Kingstreeters (4-10-1) who are on a bit of a role with Bristol Central on tap to complete regular season play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match belonged to Eastern’s Maggie Kozikowski (two goals) early on and then over second half play, Alaina Joy kicked in a couple scores to make things academic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Maria Perrone added a score, leading to a 5-0 triumph on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern defeated the Panthers (1-13-1) for the second time this season, both by a 5-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that 2-0 edge at the half probably felt like four or five goals with the way the Kingstreeters were churning on offense and defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers outshot the Panthers 26-5 overall and at the net, the visiting aggression held the edge, 17-4, with shots at the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hailey Beebe earned another shutout, making four saves along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt keepers were kept busy, snaring 12 shots overall but the Eastern offense was sharp from the onset.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kozikowski nabbed his first scholastic goal just two minutes into the fray as Eastern was on the offensive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She scored off a great cross from Kate Patterson,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Maria Perrone started the play by winning the ball in the middle, playing back to Megan Krok, who threaded a great pass to Kate out wide.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twenty-one minutes later, Kozikowski was back at it again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in a shot from the corner of the 18 – off a slick blast with her right foot – as the Lancers nabbed a 2-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The score lasted into the half but Eastern wasn’t finished on the scoreboard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just four minutes into the new period, Joy stole the ball at midfield and broke through the backline for a goal, making it a 3-0 push.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, five minutes later, there was more joy for the BEHS girls soccer program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Joy found the net for the second time, receiving a through ball from Haylee Harrison,” said Redman of Eastern’s fourth goal. “Alaina did the rest slotting a shot inside the far post.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, with 25 minutes to play, it was Perrone’s turn to kick a ball into the Platt net.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Maria Perrone pressures the defense and pokes the ball past the keeper to cap the win,” said Redman of the final tally.&nbsp;</p>
