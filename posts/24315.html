<p>“I have been honored to support the recent groundbreaking of Wheeler Health and the Carrier apartment projects in Downtown’s Centre Square,” said Rasmussen-Tuller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he has been a supporter of the Wheeler project from its inception and worked to get it approved, over objections to the project by the current city council, which reversed an initial vote to cancel the project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have proven that I am able to work with members of all parties to ensure the end goal is met, putting Bristol first,” Rasmussen-Tuller said in his announcement post.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rasmussen-Tuller is a commissioner on Bristol’s Economic and Community Development Board, serving in the role since his 2019 when he was appointed by then-Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu. Most recently he ran for state representative in the 77th District.</p>

<p>“I am excited for the opportunity to run on the Democratic ticket with Scott Rosado, who is a great role model and candidate for mayor,” said Rasmussen-Tuller. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Scott and I worked well together on projects when he was on Council and I have no doubt we will do even more together if we are elected to serve Bristol in these roles.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rasmussen-Tuller is a local business owner, recently relocating his business, AR Tuller Realty, to King Street in Bristol. The Bristol native is raising his three children along with his husband, Ken, who is the recently elected chairperson of the Bristol Democratic Town Committee.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
