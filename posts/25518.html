<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse program earned a measure of revenge against the Middletown/Coginchaug program on Friday afternoon - seizing a huge 16-12 win on the road in a bout from Middletown High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters have won their seventh straight match, moving to 7-2 overall this season and avenging its 12-11 setback to the same team back on April 4.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern’s Emma Stavens was somehow forgotten about by the visiting aggression.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She blasted Middletown for eight goals - notching half her team’s total - while also dishing out an assist over the winning endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury was also on the money, dropping in six goals while dishing out an assist as the Drury/Stavens duo was responsible for 14 of the 16 scores Eastern mustered that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenzie Aparo and the crafty Taigan Parent each tallied a goal while Sarah Hartley also added an assist for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers dominated the draw from the start while Avery Ellis in the goal was tough to stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
