<p> Joseph J. Fedor Jr, 87, of Bristol passed away from natural causes on Wednesday, Jan. 11, at the Pines in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Known simply as Joe, he was born on 24 April, 1935 in Queens, N.Y., which started his love affair with the New York Mets and the Football Giants. He was the son of late Joseph Fedor and Camile (Bloise) Fedor. He had one sister, Carol (Fedor) Vitole who passed away in her early 20s. Raised in Queens where he attended school and played sports, he blossomed into a quarterback on the local football team at St. Kevin’s High School and an outstanding baseball player. A smooth swinging left-handed hitter, he was drafted by New York Baseball Giants and played minor league ball professionally for a short time.</p>

<p>After his playing career, he enlisted in the U.S. Army serving as a Military Policeman for a four-year enlistment. Joe also worked as a newspaper reporter along the busy streets of Manhattan.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe married the late Marie (Badovich) Fedor and started raising their family before moving to Bristol, in 1973 to work at Pioneer National Title Insurance company as a sales representative. They were both active members of St. Stanislaus and St. Gregory churches.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An avid golfer and rabid sports fan, he passed his enthusiasms on to his children who survive him: Chris Fedor of Southington, Rear Admiral Mark Fedor (U.S. Coast Guard) and his wife Amy of Key West, Fla., and Felicia (Fedor) Licki and her husband Kevin of Bristol.  He was the proud grandfather of nine grandchildren.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
