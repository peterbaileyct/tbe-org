<p>Thomas Mark Lyman, 70, of Bristol died on Dec. 27, 2022, after a short but courageous battle with cancer. He is survived by his daughter and son-in-law, Erin and Rob Rasmussen of Wallingford, and his significant other, Judy Laprise of Plainville.</p>

<p>Thomas was born in Bristol on Feb. 25, 1952, to Mortimer Lyman and Helen (Driscoll) Lyman. He graduated from St. Paul High School in Bristol and then attended Southern Connecticut State University. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Elks Lodge of Bristol. In his retirement, Tom volunteered at Bristol Hospital and made many friends at the Bristol Senior Center. He was a lifelong sports fan and always could be found cheering on his beloved Red Sox. Anyone who knew Tom knows he hated to sit still; he loved jogging, hiking, and dancing. He was an avid Elvis fan.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
