<p>The accident occurred around 4:45 a.m. near Cumberland Farms, at the intersection of Pine and Emmett streets.</p>

<p>A witness on the scene stated that the pedestrian was a homeless woman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She was crossing the street with her cart, when a car came and hit her in the middle of the road. The driver went through the red light," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I went into the road to block any other cars from hitting her again because I didn’t know if they could see her on the ground, and I didn’t want her to get hit again.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police are currently on scene. The road is closed, and Dept. of Transportation is encouraging drivers to seek alternative routes.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
