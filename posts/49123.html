<p>“Community members and residents cast over 1,500 votes when asked to vote for their favorite playground design for Seymour Park," said BPRYCS community engagement coordinator Erica Benoit in the release announcing the vote. </p>

<p>"We’re hoping to continue that momentum and engagement into the selection process for Federal Hill Green’s new playground."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community members are able to vote between two proposed playground designs, however both of the proposed playground designs serve children ages 5 to 12 and include elevated and ground level accessible play elements, slides and climbing elements.

<p><br>“Selecting the new playground design at Federal Hill is the next step in the department’s ongoing Upgrade Your Play campaign, which launched in 2022,” said BPRYCS superintendent, Dr. Joshua Medeiros. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The campaign aims to understand community needs and solicit feedback in order to deliver high quality facilities to Bristol residents. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The most recent project to be completed as part of the Upgrade Your Play campaign was the installation of the new castle and ship playground at Seymour Park, which opened earlier this summer,” Medeiros added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funding for the playground was adopted in the new fiscal year budget by the City Council and Board of Finance and is allocated from the Local Capital Improvement Program (LOCIP) fund.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
