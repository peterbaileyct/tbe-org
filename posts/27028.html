<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Bristol Eastern boys track and field program had a tremendous postseason appearance at the recent Class MM track and field event from Willow Brook Park in New Britain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers placed among the top five of the annual events, squaring away 40 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That score allowed Eastern to seize fifth place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only Class MM champs Windsor (98 points), runner up Rockville (64) along with Daniel Hand (63.5) and East Lyme (55) were able to topple the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a sterling regular season (12-2 overall), the Kingstreeters proved tough over a huge slate of events from New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Eastern Track &amp; Field had a great day at the Class MM Championships yesterday,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “The kids demonstrated real growth. They showed that they not only belonged to be there, but that they can also excel on the big stage.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All athletes who finished in the top five are eligible for the Open showcase in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there was a record-breaking performance by the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior sensation Jack Mulcunry won the Class MM title in the challenging 800 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He defeated the entire field, establishing a new school and state meet record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He won a gritty race, broke the state meet record and broke his previous school record with a time of 1:53.43,” said Ryskowski. “He moves on to the State Open this Monday, June 5.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the crafty Mulcunry isn’t the only athlete from King Street to see his postseason fortunes continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Rayshon Andrews was busy that afternoon in New Britain, placing in three different events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His finish of 22.11 seconds in the 200 meters was good for third place and a slot at the State Open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Andrews wasn’t done as his long jump performance also put him into the top three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His make of 20 feet, 4.5 inches was good for third place while fellow junior Michael Sherill Jr. was simply tremendous in the high jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sherill made a completion of five feet, 10 inches for fifth place - earning a nod to the State Open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Rayshon Andrews and Michael Sherill Jr also moved on to the State Open in their individual events,” said Ryskowski. “Ray placed third in long jump and third in the 200. Mikey placed fifth in high jump. Both compete in these individual races this Monday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was the advancement of the three relay teams, all heading to the Open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x100 meter relay, the Eastern grouping of senior Preston Poirier, Justin Sanchez and Dennis Cruz, along with Andrews, took fourth place in a speedy 43.67 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s combination of junior Damien Colon, Mulcunry, Cruz and Sanchez placed fifth in the 4x400 meter relay (3:26.09) as did the 4x800 team - punching their ticket to the Open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dominic Tartarelli, Mulcunry, Cole Beland and Jase Koczur zipped up a time of 8:15.46.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All relays advance to the State Open,” said Ryskowski. “The 4x100 [team] placed fourth in Class MM with a time of 43.67, the 4x800 [squad] placed fifth with a time of 8:15.46, and the 4x400 [grouping] placed fifth with a time of 3:26.09.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a really good showing by the Lancers as a large grouping will be heading to New Britain to square off against the all the top competition from all over Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Overall, the team placed fifth in Class MM,” said Ryskowski. “I'm very proud of these boys and how far they've come.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Girls score three points in Class L</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern’s girls track and field program captured a few points at the Class L championship event in New Britain last Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the girls high jump, junior Ryan Braccia captured seventh place with a leap of four feet, 10 inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She earned two points for her efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the always challenging 4x800 meter relay event, the girls at Eastern tallied a very good eighth place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grouping of Cecelia Gilbert, Kaydence Meyer, Lauren Ayotte and Kaelyn Gonzalez roped up a time of 10:26.76 to notch a point for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just missing a scoring opportunity was Ayotte in the javelin as her heave of 90 feet, six inches gave her a ninth-place finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez ended the 1600 meters in 5:30.22 (10th place) and finished the 3200 in 11:56.63 - good for 10th place.</p>
