<p>The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team had an extremely competitive 2021-22 campaign which included several big wins along the way and a near upset of No. 12 Bethel in the first round of the Class L state tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three players from the Lancers nabbed CCC South All-Conference honors this season which included seniors Ciara Collins and Janessa Gonzalez along junior Taigan Parent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez manned the center position for several games this season and had a tremendous finish to the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her final 11 games, Gonzalez dropped in averages of 11.9 points and 9.5 rebounds-per-game – shooting a solid 45-percent from the field over that stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Eastern’s last 36 contests, Gonzalez was the only player not named Collins to lead Eastern in scoring during a game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez saved her best for last as she dropped in 18 points – hitting 8-of-10 field goals – in Eastern’s tough 46-45 loss to Bethel in a Class L first round game back on February 28.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She either led or co-led the team in rebounding seven times and over her final six games, Gonzalez scooped in 58 rebounds for an average of 9.7 rebounds-per-night – snaring a career best 15 rebounds – along with 20 points – in a tough loss to Naugatuck Valley League challenger Watertown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 79 offensive rebounds led the team as she gobbled up eight offense rebounds in a game twice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She snared six double-doubles this season, tallied at least 11 points in four out her five final games and added two contests of three steals and blocked three shots twice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also displayed an underrated passing game as Gonzalez co-led the squad in assists four times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez was a great leader for the program and was easily the most improved player on the squad this year. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent was second in three-pointers made this season, scored her share of points, and grabbed several rebounds to help Eastern reach the state tournament once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied three games of 11-plus points which included two 16-point performances and had a huge game versus Bristol Central the second time around on February 14. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she stepped up her game over her final six games of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent dropped in 8.0 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.0 assists-per-game over that half-dozen game stretch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had Central’s number from downtown over the two city series games this season, draining 6-of-13 shots from deep and averaging 13.5 points-per-game against the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 16 points against Central on February 14 was important as she canned a 3 at the third period buzzer to give the Lancers a big 18-point push heading into the final frame of play. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent, like everyone has in her family over the years at Bristol Eastern, was the squad’s leader in free throw percentage at 83.3-percent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along the way, she snared a career-high seven rebounds at Middletown while dishing out five assists on three different occasions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent either led or co-led the program in assists this year nine times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her four steals against Edwin O. Smith to open the season was her career high.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the junior guard was third on the team in scoring and assists and in the top five for rebounds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her improvement from 3-point territory, another staple of the Parent family, was remarkable as she dropped in 23 trifectas after just hitting one over her first two campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Numbers</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gonzalez</strong> – Season Numbers: 21 games played (20 starts), 9.3 points-per-game (second on the team), 8.4 rebounds (second). Shot 40-percent from the field. Scored 196 points and snatched 177 rebounds overall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
