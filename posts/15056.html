<p>BRISTOL – Pitching and defense wins games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball squad gives its pitching staff any kind of offensive contribution, the locals are tough to beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what happened on Saturday against Northeast as Post 2 notched a 6-0 win in first round Pod C state tournament play on Saturday from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Matt Beaucar was absolutely sensational as he chucked a 100-pitch, two-hit gem which included nearly half-a-dozen strikeouts and did an impressive job wiggling out of any trouble he faced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Matty pitched great,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “I thought he got a little tired in the middle of the game around the fourth inning. But he pitched through it.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He just pitched really well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Diego Mercado nabbed both hits for the visitors but other than that brief offense, Northeast didn’t compile much from the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the suspense early as Post 2 notched three first inning runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris (two hits, two runs) singled on, Jayden Churchill, Adam Caron, Ryan Fradette, and Tyler Martin all drew base on balls, a fielder’s choice by Tyler Stickels and a huge base hit by Dylan Woodsome put the pressure on the Northeast off the bat - propelling the home team to a 3-0 edge through one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The key was the first inning,” said LaPenta. “The kid [Northeast pitcher Matt Haggerty] kind of settled in after that first inning. We got to him early. Woodsome got a big hit there. To put up three runs was huge.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Haggerty drew the loss, allowing four earned runs overall, walking six, and fanning three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Zone 3 challenger never recovered from that three run first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fourth, Northeast had its chance to make it a game but simply couldn’t generate that critical RBI tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hit-by-pitch and two walks loaded the bases but Beaucar induced a groundout to short to snuff out the drive as Bristol’s 3-0 edge was holding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the fifth, the locals put the event away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris etched up his second hit of the showdown and in the biggest surprise of the outing, he ended up stealing second base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After another walk to Churchill, Bristol scored two more runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron bunted and Fradette dropped in a single as Post 2 went up 5-0 through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the sixth, Martin walked, Chris Osuch singled, and Norris laid down a perfect bunt - plating one final run - as Post 2 squared up a 6-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ryan had a big hit there for two insurance runs and then we had the safety squeeze,” said LaPenta. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the sixth, Northeast tried to rally again as clean-up hitter Mason Wilson snuck a ball by Elliot at shortstop - just escaping his grasp - while Mercado added his second hit to put two on with two gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But a fly out by Isaac Minaya ended the half-frame with Bristol keeping the visitors off the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That was a pretty nasty hop,” said LaPenta of the play at shortstop. “But we made all the plays defensively.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staying in until the end, Beaucar went 1-2-3 for the complete game shutout as Bristol survived and advanced in first round, Northern Division play with the 6-0 win over Northeast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Sunday, Pod C top-seed Waterford is on deck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford will have its hands full with Bristol ace Roberto Cruz (4-0) dealing from the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought we just played a great game overall,” said LaPenta of the Northeast victory. “Now we’ll have Roberto go tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p>
