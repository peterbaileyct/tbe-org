<p>MERIDEN - In the second game of a Zone 1 doubleheader against Meriden on Sunday afternoon, it resembled much of the first encounter of the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol once again posted four runs in the top of the first and unlike the first showdown, extra innings were not required in the rematch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pitcher Matt Beaucar (2-4 overall) threw a five-hit gem, striking out eight, as Post 2 scooped up a 7-2 victory from Ceppa Field in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the second game, we jumped right on them again with a 4-0 lead,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “That’s huge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And just like the first game of the twin bill, Bristol’s top of the order in the first inning sunk Meriden pitching from the onset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, pitching and defense took care of the rest for Post 2 (9-5 Zone 1, 9-6 overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris walked on a full count to open the showdown and Jayden Churchill (3-for-3, two runs, two doubles) blasted a two-base hit to center, putting two on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron (1-for-2, two walks, two runs) walked to load things up and Ryan Fradette (2-for-3, four RBI) slapped a blooper into shallow center, scoring the lead two runners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, a double steal saw the ball thrown away at third in an attempt to get Caron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up scoring as Fradette easily arrived at third base in the 3-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a passed ball eventually allowed Fradette to tag the plate - giving Post 2 a 4-0 push as Meriden had to deal with Beaucar on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even a leadoff walk couldn’t spoil Beaucar’s first frame because he ended up with two Ks as Meriden did not score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This field is in tough shape,” said LaPenta. “The mound was awful, and I thought Matty pitched great. That was probably his best outing of the year on the worst mound which is nice going into the playoff game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol went right back to work in the second as Mike Roalf singled to left and when the ball got by the fielder, the runner nabbed second base.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Churchill made it 2-for-2 by dancing a ball just off the foul line in right, scoring Roalf, as the double made it 5-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Tyler Stickels earned Bristol’s fifth walk as the bases were loaded with two away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Tyler Martin grounded out as Post 2 was in charge by five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connor Bennett walked to open the second and with one away, Beaucar made a beautiful throw off a groundout for the second out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Bennett tried to take third, and Stickels - playing at first base before smashing his finger early in the third inning - made an on-the-money throw to Caron to catch the runner - ending the inning with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An RBI single by Meriden’s Max Giacco netted Meriden’s first run inn the third and after Beaucar’s fifth K, Post 2 was leading by a 5-1 tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the fourth, Churchill picked up his third hit while Caron jammed a bloop double to no-man’s land in right, putting runners on second and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette cleared the bases with a sharp base hit to left as the two-RBI tally propelled Bristol to a 7-1 push through three-in-a-half frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Beaucar pickoff of Bennett at second base ended the fourth as Meriden’s offense was stuck in neutral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the fifth, Connor Cyr singled to right and when Roalf reached on an error at first base, Bristol had two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Norris’s line drive at second was snatched and Roalf was doubled up at first in a bang-bang play to end the half-inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 45 put two on with two away in the fifth but nothing came of it as Bristol maintained its 7-1 advantage going into the sixth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the frame, Beaucar scooped up strikeouts number seven and eight as Bristol went into the final inning ahead by six runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 hung around as Rio Fernandez punched a two base hit to left but the runner was stranded in the end as Post 45 was down to its final at-bats with Beaucar still dealing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple hits allowed Post 45 to score a late run but Bristol put the event away with a Beaucar pickoff at second base as Bristol zipped up its third consecutive win - defeating Meriden by a 7-2 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All in all, it was a great day,” said LaPenta. “It was a long day with the first game being nine innings.”</p>
