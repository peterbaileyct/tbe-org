<p>BETHEL – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team was one bucket away from advancing in the CIAC Class L Tournament on Monday night – snaring the lead late against No. 12 Bethel before just coming up short in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the 21<sup>st</sup> ranked Lancers left it all on the floor over a tough 46-45 decision in a hotly-contested playoff game from Bethel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 8-13 for the year while Bethel (13-8) advanced to second round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers did an incredible job after a two-point first quarter to draw even and eventually snare the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But foul trouble, missed opportunities and turnovers did-in the locals in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a fitting tribute, Eastern’s senior duo of Janessa Gonzalez and Ciara Collins led the squad in scoring one final time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez and Collins led the Lancers with 18 and 14 points, respectively, while Emma Stavens kicked in eight.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Lacey&nbsp;led Bethel with&nbsp;18 points while Rebecca McLaughlin&nbsp;added 10 for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wildcats led 9-2 through one period as the only Eastern basket of the quarter was netted by Gonzalez with 1:40 to go in the frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Kingstreeters fought back, making a game of it once the second period commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers&nbsp;outscored Bethel 11-2 over the first 2:47 of the second period, seizing a 13-12 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent canned a three from the baseline, Collins scored on a drive, Gonzalez kicked in a shot, and Stavens scored on a steal and lay-up to propel Eastern to that slim lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Collins picked up her third foul with 5:13 left in the stanza and had to sit for the remainder of the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez ended up scoring eight points in the tilt as the Lancers grabbed a 22-19 push at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins and Gonzalez opened the third quarter with hoops as Eastern was flirting with a double-figure advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez flipped in a baseline jumper midway through the period, followed by two additional hoops, as the Lancers opened up a 30-22 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bethel used a 10-0 run over the next three minutes, going to the rim for four consecutive hoops, to scoop up a 32-30 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wildcats led 34-32 at the end of three but had to hold on to dear life over the final eight minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads went back and forth over the fourth period as three inside buckets led Bethel to a 40-34 advantage with 5:40 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins then fed Gonzalez for a hoop while dropping in two foul shots as the Lancers trailed 40-38 with four minutes to play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams committed turnovers from there before Stavens blasted in a three from the baseline and with 1:50 left, Eastern was in front at 41-40.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lacey then drained a 3 of her own with 1:35 to play as the Wildcats retook the lead, 43-41, before the visiting aggression re-tied the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins canned two foul shots when she got fouled on her patented spin move and with 1:08 left in regulation, it was a 43-43 game&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lacey then scored on a drive, plus a foul, and when that free throw fell in, it ended up being the game-winning point as Bethel went up 46-43 with just under a minute to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins was fouled again, made two more free throws, as Eastern closed the deficit to 46-45 with 40 seconds remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had a chance, in the closing seconds, to snare the game-winning hoop but just couldn’t put in that go-ahead basket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With nine seconds to play, Collins – facing a double-team – drove to the hoop, missed the attempt with 3.3 seconds to go but as the ball went out of bounds, Eastern maintained possession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the final play of the game, Bethel stole the Eastern inbounds&nbsp;pass to seal the win as the Lancers fell by a single point, 46-45.</p>
