<p>Joe Kapacziewski died last week on Jan. 23 at his home in Texas. He was 40-years old.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suppose we could leave it at that because that is probably the way Joe would like it. But for those of you who are not aware of his story, I would like to tell you about a man who was a true American hero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe never had what could be described as an easy life. His parents divorced when he was young. When he was 12-years old, his father died in an auto accident in Texas, and Joe and his brother and sister moved to Bristol to be cared for by their wonderful grandparents, George and Alice Churchill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe attended Bristol Eastern High School where everyone just called him Joe Kap. He was a strapping 5’7” tall and weighed in at all of 120 pounds. In spite of his size, he played football and wrestled. I had the privilege of being one his coaches in football. As an athlete, Joe backed down to no one. He was a determined competitor, and he became quite accomplished on the wrestling mats, but you would never hear him boast or even mention his accomplishments. He was humble and kind and generous to all he met.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Joe graduated from Eastern, he immediately enlisted in the army, and it is in the army that he became a legend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe completed his basic training at Fort Benning, Ga., in 2001. He then served for over 15 years in the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Ranger Special Troops Battalion, and Regimental Headquarters Company.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout his tours he served as a rifleman, grenadier, squad automatic rifleman, squad leader and platoon sergeant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Oct. 3, 2005 in Northern Iraq, just as his team were coming to the end of their tour, Joe’s convoy was ambushed. An enemy grenade fell through the gunner’s hatch in his Stryker vehicle and exploded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sgt. Kapacziewski took severe damage to his right arm and leg. It ripped apart the brachial artery and nerve in his right arm and shattered his right leg below the knee, damaging his hip in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was transported to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington where he spent seven months before returning to Fort Benning. For two years, despite over 40 surgeries, his leg would not heal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In March 2007, he allowed doctors to amputate the leg and Joe was moved to the Brooke Army Medical Center for six months of physical therapy. There, he learned how to use a prosthetic, not just so he could walk, but in the hopes that he could one day return to serve alongside his fellow Rangers, a feat that had never been accomplished by anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To return to his squad leader position, he had to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test which included a five-mile run in under 40 minutes, 12-mile road march in less than three hours, fast rope out of a helicopter, and parachute with a 45-pound combat load.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within 10 months he had completed the physical test and soon after he was back in the action, as squad leader of his Army Ranger Regiment. He went on to do five more tours with his prosthetic leg.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe wrote a book titled, “Back in the Fight: The Explosive Memoir of a Special Operator Who Never Gave Up.” It is a full account of his 10 years of service in the Rangers, the accident that cost him his leg, and the strength he needed when he decided to return to service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked about his ordeal of getting back in the Rangers, Joe was often quoted, "You've got to take it day by day, because each day it will get better. It's not an easy road. Stay positive, and don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something." Joe could have been describing his life in those two sentences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he retired, Joe was living in Texas with his wife Kimberly and his sons, Wyatt and Cody. He remained active, continuing to serve his country and lead his brothers-in-arms until the time of his passing.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
