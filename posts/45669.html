<p>Following consecutive losses to E.O. Smith in overtime and Canton, the Bristol Co-op lacrosse team returned home to take on Windsor for senior night.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to the game, two Bristol Central seniors, Mark Palamar and Dylan Brown, as well as two Bristol Eastern seniors, Aidan Collins and Vincent Howley, were honored for their time, leadership, and dedication to the program.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Once the game started it was lights out for Windsor as the Bristol squad completely dominated from face-off to final horn.&nbsp; A 19-1 victory meant early exits for the starters but plenty of quality time for the younger players.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ian Reardon led the scoring barrage with five goals and Jayden Glasper followed with four. Brady Bell was in full distribution mode as he racked up four assists. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark Palamar and Ryland Colainni each racked up four ground balls in a great defensive effort.&nbsp; Bell and Aidan Collins each saw two goals find the back of the net, while freshman Chace Stapina also had two. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braydon Dwyer was a ground ball machine as he scooped up five, while also setting up two goals.  Dylan Brown saw the field just long enough to secure his 300th ground ball, which is a significant accomplishment for the senior from BC.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vinny Howley saw few shots but was able to come away with five saves in goal.  </p>

<p>Bristol wraps up the regular season with a game at Rocky Hill on Thursday then moves into the post-season next week.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
