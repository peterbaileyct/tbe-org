<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As predicted, the CCC Tier III confrontation between Platt and Bristol Eastern football programs on Friday night went down to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by one, the Lancers could have taken the game from the Panthers with a late score but in the end, Platt snuck by Eastern over a 7-6 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers moved to 5-1 overall while the Kingstreeters dropped to 4-2 as both programs were in position to take the showdown in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we showcased two evenly matched teams tonight,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “Platt’s a heck of a team, well coached. They’re physical [and] they did a lot of good stuff. Our kids, I thought we made [Platt] play our way a lot of the night.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the scoring came over a five-minute stretch that sandwiched halftime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored a touchdown at the halftime horn but missed the two-point conversion to snare a 6-0 edge at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Platt’s first series of the third quarter, the visiting aggression answered with a TD and on a successful PAT, the team scooped in a 7-6 lead with 7:01 remaining to play in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, it was an offensive struggle by both outfits with similar statistics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt just out gained Eastern 206-173 overall in total yards which is pretty close over the grand scheme of things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had the ball just one more time than the Panthers (48-47 in terms of possession) while Platt held longer control of the ball (26:27 to 21:33).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with Eastern’s running game shut down a bit, the program went to its quarterback, Kamden Laprise, in several clutch situations and the junior delivered.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laprise went 8-of-21 overall for 93 yards and a touchdown while squaring up 30 yards on seven carries. His 123 combined yards was an excellent contribution to nearly topple the Panthers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Eastern’s rushers limited to 80 combined yards, Laprise made several big strikes late to keep a couple drives alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had to rely on him a little bit,” said Julius of Laprise. “Platt’s a tough front and they did a nice job of taking some things away. Plus, the way the game kind of flowed, we kind of had to get into some throwing situations a little earlier than [we wanted] but Kam stepped up. He used his legs, he made a lot of big completions, and the receivers did a nice job out there.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just came up a point short.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Eastern caused havoc on Platt’s first two drives, ending with a sack by Randy DeNoto and an interception from Alex Corvo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Zavecz (11 tackles), Mikey Sherrill, Ryan Zavecz and Hunter Wells all made tackles-for-losses to help limit the drives of Joel Ray (26 carries, 102 yards) and Amari Robinson (8-38) while quarterback Melvin Sanchez was limited to only 4-of-9 passes for 65 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was scoreless through one and with 3:46 left to play in the second period, Platt was stopped at its own 18 and forced to punt -- leading to the first score of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the ninth and final play of Eastern’s drive with three seconds before the half, Laprise scrambled to the right, sprinting towards the BE sideline as the clock showed 0:00.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laprise slung the ball to an open Zion Otero -- all alone in corner -- as the receiver made the reception and the Lancers captured six points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on the two-point conversion run, Eastern’s Jaiden Fore (12 carries, 42 yards) was stopped at the one yard-line by Platt’s Landon Freemantle to keep it 6-0 going into the break. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a big play at the end of the half,” said Julius. “Unfortunately, we didn’t convert there on the [two-point] conversion.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers got the ball to open the third period but went three-and-out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on a very short field, Platt put together the game-winning score -- starting on Bristol Eastern’s 24-yard line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Punctuating a five-play drive, Robinson received the ball via direct snap and charged through the middle of Eastern’s line on a seven-yard touchdown scamper to tie the contest up at 6-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Jesus Vasquez kicked in the extra point, the tally proved to be the game winner in the end - making it 7-6 with 7:01 remaining in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was still over 18 minutes left in the game and Eastern had chances to steal the game back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the score, Eastern turned the ball over on downs, the teams then exchanged punts and with 10:31 to play, Platt had the ball and the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers stitched together a nine-play jaunt, got to the Eastern red zone but turned the ball over on downs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had the ball with 4:19 remaining in the game and off a huge 17-yard strike by Laprise to Noah Albert (three catches, 43 yards), the home team entered the Panthers’ territory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, on the final play of the drive, Laprise made a run up the gut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laprise was stripped from behind as Platt pounced on the ball with 2:13 remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It comes down to a one-point game,” said Julius. “In those situations, you have to be mistake free and unfortunately, it just didn’t go our way tonight."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern held the fort on the ensuing Platt drive as the squad called timeout and forced to a 4-and-long situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt was forced into one final punt and on Eastern’s final offensive play, Laprise’s pass was picked off - ending the contest as the Panthers nabbed a huge 7-6 win on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The ball didn’t bounce our way,” said Julius. “We have two really tough losses here, back-to-back, at home – games we feel we could have won. We just have to stay together as a group. We still have to do a lot of good things this season and that’s the hope. I’m really proud of the kids. The effort was really, really good.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Platt’s a 5-1 football team and if a couple things go our way, we would be [5-1].”&nbsp;</p>
