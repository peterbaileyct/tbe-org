<p>CROMWELL - One of the lasting visuals from the Bristol Central volleyball squad’s 3-1 throttling of East Lyme on Wednesday evening was situated behind the Rams’ bench at the semifinal showdown from the neutral site at Cromwell High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the first set commenced between the squads, a member of the Central student section was holding up a picture of Rams’ head coach Lance Pepper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was something some people would call a ‘fat head’ which is a blown-up picture of a person, place or thing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this time around, the student section was supporting their favorite girls volleyball coach whose guided the team to the state championship round for the first time in school history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Bristol had an impressive fan showing at the game in Cromwell which helped give the squad a little boost at various points of the showdown against East Lyme.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And soon after the sterling victory over the Vikings, various media members were interviewing the always insightful Pepper about the match and the chance of his squad possibly winning a state title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, during the interview process, that "fat head" picture of Pepper’s face made it behind the row of media members interviewing the winning coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pepper eventually noticed his picture being proudly displayed during the interview and all he could do was shake his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm sorry,” said Pepper during one of the many questions. “I'm looking at [my] dopey picture right now…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The support Pepper and the volleyball team have received this season, now at a sterling 19-7, has been simply tremendous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect a big crowd on Championship Saturday as Central clashes against No. 1 Joel Barlow for the Class L title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is set for 1 p.m. -- the second championship of the day -- from the gymnasium at East Haven High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Pepper is hoping to see several more ‘fat heads’ from the Central faithful at the venue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Crediting the offseason</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pepper was quick to note that this successful campaign started long before the regular season even commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to improve in sports, it’s about putting the time and work in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of his players hit the courts over just about all four seasons of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It starts in the offseason," said Pepper. "These kids work their tails off with their conditioning. They're playing club [volleyball] all over the place [and] traveling all over the United States."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that kind of commitment keeps seniors like Sam Sklenka hopping here, there and everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her commitment to the softball program at Central also factors into things and it's that understanding and desire to improve and get better -- not just as individuals, but as a team -- that have put the Rams’ volleyball program on the doorstep of something very big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been really working hard in the offseason and it’s finally paying off,” said Sklenka. “It’s been something we’ve talked about since day one and it’s finally coming true. Everything we’ve talked about is actually happening. It’s crazy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Central victory over No. 1 Joel Barlow would not only lead to a Class L championship but give the program its first 20-victory campaign in school history.</p>
