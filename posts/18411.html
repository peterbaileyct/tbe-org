<p>The Bristol Police Department was born in November 1893 when Howard Arms was appointed Chief of Police. Before the end of the year, Irving Shubert, T.J. Miller, and George Oviatt were confirmed as policemen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The department's early days saw officers tracking down horse thieves and vagrants while shutting down illegal cock fights.</p>

<p>Before the establishment of the police department, Bristol relied on constables, the Society for the Prevention of Thieving, and The Mutual Protective Association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday night, an act of senseless violence was perpetrated against The Bristol Police Department and it has shaken the community. Unfortunately, in the course of 129 years, this is not the first time Bristol has lost those charged with protecting the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three heroic police officers died in the line of duty prior to Wednesday nightâ€™s unspeakable tragedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are their stories:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Jan. 16, 1930, Officer James McNamee, 39, was walking his beat in Forestville and came upon a suspicious-looking car at the gas station of Oscar Ebb on the corner of Washington Street and Stafford Avenue (where Ivy's and Steve's Package once stood).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While questioning the driver, he was shot in the back by a passenger in the back seat. He died at Bristol Hospital.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police Chief Ernest T. Belden said, "He was a quiet fellow but one who did not know fear. Whenever he saw anything, he never went by it without first investigating. He was an officer in whom all his superiors had great confidence. His death is certainly a great loss to the department."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was laid to rest in Westfield, Mass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
