<p>Bristol’s American Legion team picked a bad time for their bats to go silent, as Ridgefield defeated the home team 5-0 Thursday night at Muzzy Field. It was Bristol’s fourth game against Ridgefield in less than a week, and both of their losses in the state tournament were to the Ridgefield nine.</p>

<p>In 14 innings of the state tournament, Ridgefield pitchers held Bristol to a single run. On Thursday, the offense could only muster three scattered singles and never really threatened to score throughout the night.</p>

<p>Ryan Maglio did everything he could to keep Bristol in the game, pitching five and two-thirds innings of two-hit ball and allowing only one earned run. Maglio struck out five, but he did issue six walks, which drove up his pitch count.</p>

<p> Bristol trailed by only two going into the seventh, but Ridgefield put the game away with three runs in the top of the inning.</p>

<p>The loss ends Bristol’s run in the state tournament, while Ridgefield advances to the next round being played in Middletown and South Windsor.</p>

<p>Bristol enjoyed an explosion of offense in a 10-game winning streak leading up to the tournament, scoring eight to 10 runs in almost every win. But that type of production ended at the beginning of the states, and Bristol’s pitchers were facing long odds throughout.</p>
