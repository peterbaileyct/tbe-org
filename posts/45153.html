<p>With thrift store prices on the rise, Hand to Hand gives customers a boutique experience that is affordable, said the store director, but that's not all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But “It’s not just a thrift store,” Tina Jones said. “It’s a ministry.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hand to Hand Thrift store director Tina Jones said the store located on North Main Street is an upscale thrift shop with discount prices.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Christian based non-profit organization located at 465 North Main St., Hand to Hand Thrift Store serves the Bristol area with free furniture, household items, clothing and Christian based spiritual guidance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones runs Hand-to-Hand Direct Care Ministry which has been supported by the thrift store for eight years, she said. The ministry holds fundraisers, receives grants and accepts monetary donations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows the thrift shop to keep prices low so that people coming back, she said. She added that the store has a dollar rack to help the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For my part, I will definitely be coming back after I purchased Carhartt jeans in good condition for $9. I also thrifted another pair of jeans for free in a buy-one-get-one free sale. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On their dollar rack, I found a green blazer and white pants that I am excited to style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are doing God’s work,” Jones said. “We want it to be a fun, loving place.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often, discounts are available, and the store is a no-judgement zone. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of people like the store, Jones said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She reiterated that the majority of their funding comes from the people who support the ministry and that is how the thrift store covers its expenses--and every non-profit needs their donors.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
