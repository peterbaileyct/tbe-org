<p>When lead singer and piano player Ben Eramo took the stage at the Rockwell Theatre Saturday night, he started playing almost immediately, and he and his group, “Scenes, A Billy Joel Experience,” seized the audience's attention and kept the group totally enthralled for the entire two-and a quarter-hour concert.</p>

<p>Not only did Eramo capture the essence of Billy Joel in his singing, but he was also an exceptional artist on the piano.  Some of his piano riffs were amazing, and he was matched in instrumental skill by his four bandmates, lead guitarist Andrew Brian, drummer Rob Macy, bassist Dan Legere, and Vee Vanremoortel, who completed the lineup on saxophone and vocals. </p>

<p>Eramo covered all the decades of the “Piano Man’s” career. Highlights included “My Life,” “Only the Good Die Young,” “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant” and “We Didn’t Start the Fire.”</p>

<p>The end of the concert brought a sustained standing ovation from the appreciative audience. If more Bristol people knew how good these tribute bands are, this band in particular, the Rockwell Theatre would have been a lot more crowded Saturday night.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
