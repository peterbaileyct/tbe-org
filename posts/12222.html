<h2><strong>Arts &amp; Culture Commission Completes Fundraising for MLK39 Mural</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><em>Mural expected to be revealed in late spring</em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City of Bristol Arts &amp; Culture Commission recently announced the completion of fundraising for their upcoming MLK39 Racial Equity Mural project. In just short of two months, the Commission received nine major sponsors ($500+) and dozens of community donations to reach their predetermined goal of $15,000. The project is in partnership with Connecticut’s RiseUP Group, who are on a mission to bring 39 murals inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the state; one to honor each year of King Jr.’s life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The artist for the project, Micaela Levesque, has been selected, and the initial design is underway. Levesque, a Connecticut-based artist, recently completed a large-scale mural on the Women’s Empowerment Center in Hartford. The enormity and caliber her prior work excited Committee members, and ultimately drew them to select Levesque for this project.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s mural will be the 13th mural brought to life, with RiseUP’s Executive Director, Matt Conway, confirming a half dozen more currently underway throughout the state. Sponsorship kicked off with Main Street Community Foundation (MSCF), the project’s largest sponsor, supporting the mural with $5,000. Susan Sadecki, MCSF’s President &amp; CEO shared, “The Arts create vibrant communities and this project will not only enhance the City of Bristol, but celebrate its diversity. We are proud to be able to support this important initiative.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The public art piece will be located on the Primo Press building at 106 Riverside Avenue, with Levesque’s work set to begin in May.</p>
