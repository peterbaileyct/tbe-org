<p>Come Sunday morning, the acorns will still be tumbling down the oak trees on Broadview and huddling on the sidewalk. They crunch underfoot, litter the sidewalk with brown husks and those little acorn caps. How one of those round brown orbs transforms to these towering oaks is a marvel. And these marvels are slowly coming down, without being returned to their tree borders, and I think we are less for it. And, so it goes.</p>

<p>As for TBE, an email went out to members who have signed up as readers and paying members asking about whether we should take down our paywall, opening our content to all people while depending for our financial revenue on donations--from regular readers and foundations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This turn of events is the result of review of our current state by the Local Independent Online Newspaper (LION) Publishers. TBE is a member of this organization. Our LION reviewer likes what she sees, and she sees a bright future. That said, she had a bunch of recommendations, the first of which is to drop the paywall. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More on this in the coming weeks. For now, what is significant is, according to our survey results, 98 percent of respondents said they are willing to financially support our efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, we are going to put these results to the test. We are going to drop the paywall, if not today, on Monday. We hope our financial supporters will continue to support us. We hope more people will sign on. (And, yes, of course, we will be crawling before we run, so expect some bumps along the way.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I mentioned last week, TBE will be featuring some new writers and material from CT Mirror. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>And on to the recommended listening. A reminder that I do not go into great detail about these suggestions. The point is that they struck me as important enough to share, and that if a reader has time to listen to something, one of these is worth the time. In addition, I do not necessarily subscribe to the conclusions or agree with the sentiment. The point is to stretch my own understanding.</p>

<p>The "Capitalisn't" podcast takes up proposals by the presidential candidates in its episode, titled " Harris vs. Trump: Economics Beyond the 'Vibes.'" Included are proposal about taxes, tariffs, price gouging and the "Opportunity Economy."

<p>A somewhat disturbing and challenging podcast is from "Honestly with Bari Weiss." The episode, entitled "Douglas Murray: A Time of War," covers the Middle East. Click <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/douglas-murray-a-time-of-war-5bb">here</a>.</p>

<p>I finished "Beautyland," the novel by Marie-Helene Bertino. It's a quick read, very sweet and genuinely human, despite having for its main character an alien. </p>

<p>Consider becoming a supporting member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
