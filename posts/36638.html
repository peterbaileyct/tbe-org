<p><strong>What do you consider to be your major accomplishments during your term? And why? Not all but the most significant ones, please.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supporting the Wheeler Clinic from the beginning was important to me, especially considering a new council and mayor coming in and making a big decision many stake holders in the city were keeping an eye on. Businesses and organizations today appreciate stability and consistency more than ever considering the economic conditions and I’m glad we were ultimately able to support the community in this way. Otherwise, any action to save money on behalf of the taxpayer: putting forth the motion to normalize transfer station permit renewal fees across in person and online payment methods on the public works board, since folks were paying more by renewing in person, saving folks a little money there. Also making decisions to save on the city hall project to get it done under budget and ahead of schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do you consider to be the most critical or significant moments over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, the loss of two of our police officers last October comes to mind, and it’s still on people’s minds today. We came together as a community to support our police department regardless of politics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as a result of your experience over the past two years?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I served on the Inland Wetlands and Conservation Commission for four years prior to running for council, three of those years as secretary, so I have experience with land use and finding a balance in developmental needs and working with our natural resources. During that time, I was a volunteer in the summer of 2018 for a gubernatorial state primary candidate, which was a rewarding experience as well.<br>With the council I’ve been involved in projects on the public works board, and as liaison to the library board and cemetery commission to make progress on departmental goals. I’m also on the economic and community development board of directors steering the long-term vision for downtown as well as our other economic corridors. Building relationships has been important to creating open lines of communication to get things done, both with residents and departmental staff.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ready to blossom. We have a downtown ready to make a much-anticipated re-introduction to the world after years of waiting. We have residents excited by the work their seeing and the energy of construction. Kudos to the mayor and our city staff for working so hard to see multiple downtown projects come to light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steel is in the air and shovels are in the ground. The work is continuous as well, projects have evolved and change over the last two years, and we’ve kept the focus on making sure they get completed. I said last campaign season that progress is a moving target, we can’t sit on our laurels and expect progress to take place, and we recognize that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if reelected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Support our departments in their long-term goals and also our infrastructure. We have 60k people trying to navigate backroads to get from A to B, so we need to support our public works team in their goals and try to make the town easier to navigate. Tending to downtown is important, making sure we have the right pieces that fit there, as well as not neglecting our other economic engines like Route 6 and Route 229.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Work with the team we have and remember we serve the taxpayer, and we need to control our budget as best we can. We had re-evaluations which were hard on people, we need to keep that in mind, build a tax base downtown, and attract more young professionals and young families into town to sustain growth.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have become increasingly concerned that Bristol has been derailed, so to speak, from its economic path under the previous administration, and with good reason. The Wheeler Clinic project was almost lost. We see the lack of unity, cohesiveness and disconnection with the current Mayor and City Council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the proliferation of vape shops and other small retail businesses being added over the last year or two, it appears there are not any significant or substantive projects in the pipeline to bring larger businesses/companies and jobs that pay a living wage to Bristol. While small business is the backbone of America, we need to bring jobs to Bristol that can support a living wage. Being able to earn a living wage is crucial, especially for single parent families who do not receive any financial support outside of their wages. Single parents working 40 hours a week should not have to work additional jobs to support their families and pay sitters (who also do not earn a living wage!) to raise their children, in my view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The moment that clinched that decision to run was when I sat down with Scott Rosado in early February and heard his vision for Bristol, and the goals that he wanted to accomplish. In addition, I live in the 1st District, where many of Bristol’s seniors live. When I brought my Dad back to Bristol to live with me when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2021, it was extremely difficult to navigate the healthcare landscape for those afflicted with this disease. I was at a disadvantage trying to find all the resources I needed to help him. This also happened in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made things more difficult. I would like to help residents and families experiencing similar issues, so that they do not have to experience what I went through being a caretaker for my Dad.</p>

<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies<br>you for office?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to my Bachelor’s degree, my many years of community service, and my experience on the Democratic Town Committee (I currently serve as Precinct Chair for 77-02), I have served as Treasurer of a local organization that serves the homeless, as the Vice Chair of the City’s Freedom of Information Advisory Board, in addition to serving on the Board of a local not-for-profit dedicated to creating opportunities for families of modest income and enabling them to realize their dreams of home ownership. I have 30+ years of experience in the Legal, Finance and Public Utility Sectors, which have provided me with a broad spectrum of knowledge to draw from if given the opportunity to serve as a Bristol City Councilor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I view the City as being in a state of flux at the moment. The reason I say this is because the progress that was made under the previous administration appears to have stalled under the current one, in terms of job growth and economic development. While we do see new businesses opening, the majority of these jobs seem to be retail businesses that do not pay a living wage, such as vape shops. This is not a sustainable economic development model. We saw the closing of Associated Spring, which was a major employer in town and provided good paying jobs. The current administration did nothing to help these employees that lost their jobs. We need to get Bristol back on track by bringing companies here like Associated Spring and others that can offer jobs that pay a living wage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have seen many businesses close that affect where I shop, dine, and recreate. I’ve seen friends and family affected by business closures/downsizing. While I try to stay in town for the majority of my dining and shopping, I find myself in surrounding towns more often than not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if elected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I consider the biggest challenge to be bringing people together in this time of polarization and divisiveness. This is not just in Bristol, but our country as a whole. We’ve seen the corrosive effect that the recent incidents of racism and anti-semitism have had in our city, and the lackluster response of the current administration. Bristol received the kind of media attention that did not put our city in a favorable light – from a national publication, no less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I intend to listen, to learn from, and to be accessible to my constituents. I will support Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, and strive to continue the good work of the DEI Council by continuing to create those spaces where everyone’s voice is heard and valued, and to educate leaders on the importance of DEI initiatives. We need to tear down walls and dismantle silos and get back to building Community! (yes, with a capital C)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What has your thought process been over the past year while the current administration has been in office that motivated you to run?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My motivation to run for City Council is not only inspired by the current administration's lack of prioritizing inclusivity in our community, but also their perceived level of leadership. In my opinion, they take a back-burner approach to leading Bristol. They have ridden the coattails of the prior administration with economic development, specifically downtown development. But, that only gets you so far. We need to get leaders in place who take the initiative to start new projects, not just push existing ones across the finish line. We need leaders who will take a proactive&nbsp;approach at bringing businesses into the city and helping small businesses that are struggling to survive in this economy. Our leaders need to be forward-thinking and able to balance the day-to-day operations of the city and the needs for economic development project planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Of these, what are the most critical or significant moments?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I&nbsp;think the most significant moment was in one of the current administration's first meetings in 2021 when they voted against the Wheeler Health downtown project that was only pending the&nbsp;official&nbsp;vote to finalize the deal. I was one of the ECD members who organized the community to speak out against their decision and, in turn, work to get the project approved with minor changes. Now, the current administration is trying to take credit for the Wheeler Health project as if it were their own, because they voted against it then voted for it. This is a ridiculous move that proves their lack of leadership skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What are your political credentials, both prior to and as you approach the election that qualifies you for office?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been a member of the Economic &amp; Community Development (ECD) Commission since 2019. I&nbsp;ran for State Representative in 2020 and 2022 and I am an active community member and local small business owner. While "political credentials" are great for someone to have, the desire to serve your community, listen to your constituents needs, and put Bristol's best interests ahead of your personal beliefs makes you qualified for office more than anything else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you view the city today?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is a great place to work, live and raise a family. We offer high-quality education, a World Class parks system, and many small businesses that help provide a great sense of community. Bristol is very diverse, and we need to celebrate our differences and&nbsp;our similarities. There's always room for improvement and, with forward-thinking leaders, we can make Bristol even better.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Experiences/facts that confirm this view.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current administration did away with the Pride flag raising event and most won't even acknowledge Pride Month. The City did not host a Hispanic Heritage Month so it was put together by a private group who worked with the Historical Society to ensure we celebrated. Hate groups have come to Bristol multiple times and we have to fight to get the current administration to denounce them. The current administration has appointed and supported multiple individuals who have openly displayed racist, anti-semitic and sexist behaviors for various roles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What lies ahead for you for the next two years if elected? In other words, what do you consider to be your biggest challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My biggest challenge will be to ensure we get back to a sense of inclusivity. We need our community members to feel comfortable in Bristol. I have heard from many that right now, they do not. Many feel Bristol has been welcoming to hate groups due to the current administration's lack of publicly denouncing them. If elected, I will continue to denounce racism and all forms of hate, and ensure programs are in place to celebrate diversity within our community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How do you intend to advance this agenda or to meet this challenge?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will start by working with my colleagues to ensure we are celebrating our diversity. I will work to ensure we celebrate things like Pride Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, and the many other opportunities to recognize our differences within our community.</p>
