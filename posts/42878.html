<p>The Bristol Farmer's Market has incorporated as a nonprofit, promising long-term viability, according to one of the members of the founding board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The transition of the Bristol Farmers Market to its own nonprofit marks a significant step<br>towards ensuring the market's sustainability and growth," said Mickey Goldwasser, community<br>liaison of the board, in a press release announcing the new arrangement. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The decision to create a nonprofit organization aligns with the long-term vision for the market and its role within the community. We are looking forward to continued success," Goldwasser added.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past the market was overseen by the city and more recently by an arrangement between the city and the Bristol Rotary Club.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Farmer’s Market was originally created by the City of Bristol with the plan to eventually turn the market over to a non-profit organization that could continue to grow, enhance and fully focus on taking the market to the next level, according to the release.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement of the new nonprofit also included an invitation to businesses and organizations to become sponsors for the upcoming season. </p>

<p>"We are thrilled to be entrusted with the responsibility of managing the Bristol Farmers Market," said Dawn Nielsen, board chair of The Bristol Farmers Market, Inc. "The newly formed nonprofit’s goal is to uphold the market's legacy while enhancing its accessibility and offerings for the entire community."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mission of The Bristol Farmers Market, Inc. is to create a sustainable platform that supports and promotes access to fresh local food and products for all residents. By connecting the community with local farmers and producers, the market aims to foster a thriving environment for both vendors and patrons.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from Nielsen, as board chair, and Goldwasser, as community liaison, the board includes<br>secretary Lindsey Rivers and treasurer Cheryl Thibeault and members Lorry LeMaire of Twin Pines Farm, vendor liaison; Carolyn Verikas, of The Bristol Bazaar, business liaison; and John Cassidy, of the Bristol Rotary Club, nonprofit liaison.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the new management, the market will continue to operate every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. from June 22 to Nov. 2 for a total of 20 weeks in downtown Bristol in the parking lot of 10 Main St. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
