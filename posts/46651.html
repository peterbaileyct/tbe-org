<p>A family-friendly musical filled with learning and laughs is coming to the Rockwell Theater with a live performance of “Ada Twist, Scientist &amp; Friends.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fueled kids’ theater show,”&nbsp;BPRYCS Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said.&nbsp;“I thought it would be a great addition to our Downtown Live events because it’s the end of the school year and we hope kids can go home from this show with a ready-to-creative attitude for their summer vacation.”</p>

<p>Ada Twist, Scientist &amp; Friends is a high-energy musical based on the books Rosie Revere, Engineer, Iggy Peck, Architect and Ada Twist Scientist by Andrea Beaty. The books are centered around three inquisitive students in Ms. Greer's classroom and their knowledge-seeking quests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The musical adaptation takes place during a field trip gone awry where the students are faced with the ultimate test of their problem-solving skills that can only be conquered with teamwork. The performance will spotlight the STEM curriculum and feature positive role models for young scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“If the kids read the books, I think they will find it fascinating to watch live” Therriault said. “If they've never read the books, there is so much to learn from a STEM style theater show, and I think the kids will find this to be engaging throughout.”</p>

<p>Ada Twist, Scientists and Friends will be performed by TheaterWorksUSA; a professional theater based out of New York City. The not-for-profit company produce shows for young and family audiences throughout the country, including the March 2024 Downtown Live performance of “The Magic School Bus:&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in the Solar System.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The upcoming performance of&nbsp;Ada Twist, Scientists and Friends will be the sixth show of the 2024 Downtown Live season at the&nbsp;Rockwell Theater. Therriault stated that the historic 620-seat venue is ideal for family-friendly performances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“This is a great location for plays,” Therriault said, “we are excited to have more like this in the future. We are looking forward to seeing you all,” she said, “and learning about the things you want to create.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ada Twist, Scientist &amp; Friends will be held Saturday, June 15, at 3 p.m. at the Rockwell Theater.&nbsp;The performance is suitable for children aged 4-9.&nbsp;Tickets start at $25 for children 10 and under and $35 for adults.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
