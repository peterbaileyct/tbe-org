<p>We continue to seek support from our readers, one at a time, so that we can increase our reporting presence. There are a few ways for you to help our cause--local community news. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First and foremost, become one of 10 new supporting members today. Join us and benefit by choosing what categories you would like to receive notifications for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, if you are an email subscriber, please become a member by clicking on the "Become a Member" button and re-join TBE as a Reader or a financial supporter at three different levels, Supporter, Patron or Benefactor. We realize it is a bit clunky to do, but it is necessary for us to step up to the next level of support and security.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third, if you are a Facebook user, please become a member following the same procedure mentioned above.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fourth, if you have joined TBE, please let people in your circle of family and friends know so that they are aware of our campaign to raise funds to improve our reporting reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One more time, a bonus to joining us--and supporting us--is that you will get to choose the news you would like to receive. That's correct. Our new system allows people who support us financially to choose the category (categories) of posts that they would like to receive notifications as posted. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You want to be notified of the latest sports stories, click on the Sport checkbox, and you will receive notifications every time a sports story is posted. If you would like to receive City News or Government stories, just mark the City News or Government checkboxes (or both) and you will begin receiving notifications for those categories specifically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For today, we are aiming for 10 new members. We hope you will take a moment to become one of our supporters. </p>
