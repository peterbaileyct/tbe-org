<p>MILFORD – Once again, another hopeful took on the Bristol Eastern softball team in Class L tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another Eastern opponent bit the dust as the beat rolled on for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, the Lancers traveled to Milford to square off against No. 5 Jonathan Law on Wednesday afternoon in a second-round confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game came down to the wire and late game heroics by the Lancers sealed the deal in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, locked in a 4-4 stalemate in the top of the seventh, Alex Shorette drilled a go-ahead home run as No. 21 Eastern upset Law by a 5-4 final – advancing to quarterfinal round action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That amazing victory propelled the Lancers (12-10) to the round of eight against No. 4 East Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Yellowjackets advanced to the quarters via a 9-2 victory over No. 20 Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown is set for Friday at 4:30 p.m. from East Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ali Tellier picked up the win in the circle but also joined the hit parade with a two-run homer while Gracie Browne scored twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed early but Grace D’Amato scored and once Tellier connected on her round-tripper, it was a 3-3 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple runs later, it was all knotted up at 4-4 and Shorette sent out the final dagger in the seventh to help the Lancers survive and advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win ensured that Eastern will finish with a record above .500 – whenever this postseason run ends for the upset-minded program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are the lowest seed still alive in Class L tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 14 Fitch is still in the fray but it’s all about the Kingstreeters at this point and it’s going to be a tremendous battle when Eastern and East Haven go to work on Friday.</p>
