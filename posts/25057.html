<p>BRISTOL – It took just a little timeout by the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team to right the ship in its crosstown battle against St. Paul Catholic on Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were down 10-4 with seven minutes remaining in the first half when the team’s leading scorer, Emma Stavens, called for a quick break in the action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And according to Eastern coach Kayla Policarpio, that timeout helped Stavens rally the troops. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After timeout came and went, the Lancers went on a roll to square the non-conference bout away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by six, the Kingstreeters outscored the Falcons 10-2 as Eastern zipped up an impressive 14-12 victory from McPhee Field on the campus of St. Paul Catholic High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win (4-2 overall) was the Lancers’ fourth straight triumph while the Falcons fell to 2-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Lancers fell behind&nbsp;early in the game to a formidable Falcon offense,” said Policarpio. “After the half, the Lancers tied up the game and eventually put two on net to pull ahead.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul Catholic’s Emily Walker is a scoring machine, collecting a game-high eight goals while teammate Abbey Stanford added three to pace the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But once the Eastern defense got into gear, helped by that quick break in the action, the offense sprang to life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Jayna Hatcher was her usual self on defense and after that offensive onslaught by the Falcons, keeper Avery Ellis stopped numerous second half shots – allowing just two goals over the final 31 minutes of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens led the offensive charge with four goals and a couple of assists while Vanessa Drury tallied three goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenzie Aparo and Sarah Hartley splashed in two goals apiece while Taigan Parent also flipped in a shot to pace the attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another tremendous victory for the locals as the Eastern program hasn’t lost since falling to Lewis Mills (11-7) back on April 6.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a fierce game,” said Policarpio of the win over St. Paul Catholic. “We hope to see this winning streak continue into our game on Friday against Wethersfield.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wethersfield contest commences at 5 p.m. from Cottone Field and then next Tuesday, it’s a big one for Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s another city series bout as the Lancers tangle against Bristol Central from Alumni Field at 7 p.m., the first of two showdowns between the schools this year.&nbsp;</p>
