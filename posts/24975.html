<p>The final score from Friday’s game is quite misleading and provides no indication of how hard fought this game between St. Paul and Torrington was...at least for the first 4 innings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons scored thirteen runs in the top of the fifth inning to turn this 1-1 tie game into a blow out. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Logan Rembish was the winning pitcher for St Paul and Logan Tucciarone took the loss for Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first inning with 2 out, Devin Kulas singled for St. Paul. Kulas advanced to 2nd when Cal Chance was hit by a pitch, and scored on Ryan Kilpatrick's RBI double. The Falcons had the early 1-0 lead, but it was short lived. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the frame, Torrington’s Jack McCoy led off with a single. McCoy advanced to 2nd when Dean Basso walked, and then took 3rd when Melvin Alvarez hit into a fielder's choice. A wild pitch allowed McCoy to score, and the game was tied 1-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next three innings each team had opportunities to score, but neither was able to get the big hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in the top of the 5th, Jamie Leggett had a hard hit grounder that was misplayed and allowed him to reach 1st base safely. Kulas followed with the hit that literally knocked Tucciarone out of the game. The ball shot off Tucciarone's leg, and he had to be helped off the field. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Josh Bainer relieved Tucciarone, but was unable to keep the St. Paul offense in check. Of the eight batters that he faced, six had base hits and ond walked. Dom DiBecelle came in to get the final two outs, but not before Jonathan Remillard had a two RBI single, and Cole Raymond had a three run inside-the-park home run. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The close game was now a possible mercy contest, as the Falcons led 14-1 in the middle of the 5th inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington got a solo run in the bottom of the 5th inning when Joe DiPippo's fly ball was lost in the sun and dropped in for an RBI single, and the final score ended up 14-2.</p>
