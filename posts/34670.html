<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s already that time as the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern volleyball squads square off in their first of two-yearly confrontations tonight.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads ended up splitting the season series in 2022 as the Rams broke their 56-match losing streak against the Lancers via a 3-0 sweep back on October 24.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central would like to make it a two-game winning streak over Eastern for the first time since the early 1990’s while the Lancers want to get back to the pay window over its crosstown rival.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams come into the showdown on winning streaks and, per usual, when the two programs clash, it’s always a must-see event.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who has the edge in tonight’s showdown? Let’s take a look:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern’s season to date</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(5-3 overall)</strong>&nbsp;– Eastern, after dropping two straight decisions, is back on the winning path – seizing sweeps over both Maloney and South Windsor this week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those two decisions came on the road as the Kingstreeters had previously dropped bouts at RHAM (3-0) and Berlin (3-1). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that 3-0 sweep of South Windsor, Adrianna Reay dropped in 15 kills and 11 digs while Gabby Caucci added eight kills and nine digs over a complete match effort.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central’s season to date</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(5-1 overall)&nbsp;</strong>– Central has been playing extremely well under head coach Lance Pepper, getting to a sterling 5-1 by dropping just five total sets. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lily Kirk dropped in 13 kills to lead all players while Grace Higgins added 10 against the Panthers. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 3-0 setback at Southington on September 22 was the only loss by the program to date as Central is once again taking on allcomers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Bristol Streak –&nbsp;</strong>The Bristol Central volleyball team is on a one-game winning streak against Bristol Eastern, breaking a 56-match losing drought against its archrival late last season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Year –</strong>&nbsp;The Lancers defeated the Rams, three games to one, back on October 3 at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium. In the rematch on October 24, Central was a huge 3-0 winner from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect on Thursday –&nbsp;</strong>Last season, Central was looking to break its hex against Eastern and did so in dominating fashion from the court at the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a solid big three with captains Grace Higgins, Lily Kirk and Alex Rivera running the show.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those three athletes were a huge part of why the Rams ended up in the Class L finals and the trio hopes for that kind of success tonight against the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kirk is a tremendous sophomore competitor with some pure athleticism and plenty of ability at finish at the net while Higgins is also a handful as well from the frontline.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivera is the perfect floor general for this crew while senior Leah Sklenka does a little of everything for the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Isabella Alves is producing very nicely in her first season of scholastic play while juniors Emily Fontaine and Daigelis Figueroa complement the squad very well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Adrianna Reay has been tremendous at the outside hitting position for Eastern, blasting down 106 kills while bumping up 68 digs on defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She earned AVCA Player of the Week honors for the week of September 11 which included her nearly 4.7 kills-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabby Caucci (68 kills, 10 aces, 55 digs) has stepped up her game as well to help the squad win five matches to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have varying levels of experience with seniors Andrea Martir-Perez (73 digs), Katie Beaulieu (19 digs) and Samara Paranzion making big contributions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Emma Cretella is an ever improving junior while setter Naseem Hennouch (175 assists) is doing an excellent job getting Eastern into its offensive sets.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the edge in experience and playing from home in its first showdown against Eastern is a big deal as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>First BC/BE in September is rare</strong>&nbsp;– This match is a not-so-typical September showdown between the squads, battling against each other for only the fourth time in the month since 1992.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the last time the programs faced off on September 28, the squads needed the full five sets.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on September 28, 1992, Eastern defeated Central 3-2 behind set scores of 15-13, 15-10, 6-15, 9-15 and 15-8 over an epic five-set decision. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bottom Line –</strong>&nbsp;After finally winning against Eastern last year, Central has taken the mental aspect of playing against its rival out of the equation, completely.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are playing an extremely good brand of ball and are a very confident group coming into the showdown in their own gym.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has some tools up front but could get a bit overwhelmed by that veteran trio of Kirk/Higgins/Rivera.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay could plaster the ball all over the court but if Central’s defense can bump up more than a couple of digs, the home team has a great chance in this match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, you know the deal when it comes to Central/Eastern showdowns: throw the records out the window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be a good one tonight when the Rams and Lancers lock horns once again.&nbsp;</p>
