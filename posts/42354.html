<p>The second of three podcasts dealing with an interactive adventure by Bristol’s C.T. O’Brien has been posted on the BRXSTOL website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second episode, "The Offer--Chapter II," picks up with the two main characters, Joseph Ives and John Birge, planning their next steps as they forage a partnership to produce clocks in early Bristol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A third chapter, "The Secret Ending," will be presented in a living storytelling event at the Bristol Library on Saturday, March 30, from 1 to 3 p.m.</p>

<p>“I hoped to get it all done by April 2024,” O'Brien said in an earlier email, “but the story continues to develop. The good news is that there will be lots more to come in 2024, and maybe 2025, than I originally planned for, and of course, the big secret reveal at the end."</p>

<p>O’Brien kicked off the interactive immersive adventure mystery at the Bristol Historical Society late last year, when he introduced the characters involved in the search, including Bristol clockmaker Joseph Ives, who at the end of the presentation was waiting to be bailed out of debtor’s prison in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>

<p>The adventure ends with a gathering of participants at a location in Bristol, O'Brien said, where they will learn the final clues to solve the mystery. The idea is for participants to take part in the search for an answer to the mystery by familiarizing themselves with podcasts and information on the website.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The website has the teaser, trailer and both podcasts, "The Offer" chapters one and two, as well as primary sources for all of the research O’Brien uses to develop his storyline. The storyline is a combination of O’Brien’s research and some speculation that adds fictional elements.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
