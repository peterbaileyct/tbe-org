<p>GUILFORD – The Bristol Central wrestling team sent its crew to the annual Guilford Invitational this past Saturday and the program from the Mum City saw four of its grapplers make deep runs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had two athletes in championship bouts as Alex Lamarre ended up winning the 126-pound class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his title match, Lamarre battled Xavier’s Seamus Hallinan into overtime as neither grappler refused to yield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was Lamarre who won in the end, picking up a tremendous 10-8 win over the extra session to claim the 126 title.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kaden Dragon was also in the championship mix, battling into the finals of the 120-pound division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dragon ended up dropping a tough 9-3 decision to Zach Brzoska of Fairfield Warde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also that day, the Rams had two additional wrestlers fight into the consolation round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Joseph Niek (132 pounds) and Lincoln Archibald (157) both earned consolation nods but both warriors ended up losing those matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Niek ended up falling via 5-1 decision to Thomas Lemieux from Xavier and Archibald ended up getting pinned by Austin Rasmussen (Fairfield Warde) for a fourth place finish.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Rams ended up in seventh place at the weekend tournament behind a 111.5-point showing.</p>

<p>Fairfield Warde won the title with 251 points while Newtown (169) was a distant second place.</p>
