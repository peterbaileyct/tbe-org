<p>A local group has issued a news release urging Bristol residents and environmental groups to scrutinize several draft permits issued by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) for Reworld Inc., formerly Covanta, earlier this month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are committed to fighting this permit and ensuring rigorous environmental standards and robust safety measures to protect public health and the environment," said Josie Bechard-Maro, coordinator of the Bristol Residents for Clean Air in the press release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group learned from public notices published on July 5 that DEEP had issued permits for Reworld to expand their operations on 170 Enterprise Dr. with more the hours of operation, accepting more types of waste it burns, including biomedical waste and setting air quality compliance standards, as well as defining the equipment being used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We urge residents and environmental groups to scrutinize the draft permit and participate in the public comment period,” said Bechard-Maro also in the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the comment period, DEEP seeks feedback from residents regarding the necessity for a public hearing. The window for comments is between 15 and 35 days, depending on the permit. A Zoom meeting has been scheduled to discuss hearing procedures on Aug. 7, 2024, at 11 a.m. Click <a href="https://www.depdata.ct.gov/calendar/listevs.asp?selecttype=hearing">here</a> for the calendar.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reworld, then Covanta, has had requests before DEEP for the past couple of years, and BRCA has been active since 2020 with its campaign to fight having biomedical waste among the materials burned at the trash to energy complex. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group has engaged with an environmental lawyer and hosted several Zoom meetings about the issue. There have been information sessions in Plainville and Southington, as well as in Bristol, attended by representatives from DEEP and Covanta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a hiatus, when not much was happening, Bechard-Maro said in a phone conversation on Monday afternoon, upon learning of the draft permits, "Oh man, we are back at it again."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRAC, which includes several neighbors whose property on Lake Avenue is closely situated to the Covanta, is finding others with different but mutual concerns about Reworld, according to Bechard-Mao, and have allied with another group that has formed to track sounds emitting from the Reworld facility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Covanta/Reworld Noise Complaints is a private group that was formed nine months ago as more and more people are finding noise issues emanating from the plant are affecting their quality of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, BRAC is concerned with how the decision-making process in an Environmental Justice Community, a special designation for distressed municipalities under the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, is being met.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol dropped off the list within the last five years, but fits into a special grace period, making it eligible for distressed municipality benefits as well as stipulations for meeting special requirements when it comes to the creation or expansion of facilities that might potentially impact the environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group intends on meeting soon, possibly in August, however, Bechard-Maro said, "If we have to act sooner, we can."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Draft permits, before being approved, may be modified to include additional conditions based on public comments and further review by DEEP.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process includes a pre-application meeting, public notice of the permit application, an environmental justice public participation plan, technical review and a tentative determination, a public comment period and a final determination.</p>
