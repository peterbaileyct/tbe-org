<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern boys soccer team opened the season with a 2-1 win over Maloney on Tuesday evening from Alumni Field from the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the opening match for both programs and the Spartans went to work offensively right from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors scored first as a Lancers’ mix-up allowed Cristiano Cardentey to collect a loose ball in front of the Eastern net and jam it home - via a 10-yard shot just two minutes into the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that slim 1-0 edge did not last. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers and Spartans traded midfield possessions for the next twenty minutes but Eastern began to tally more of the play.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 6:18 remaining in the first frame, Maloney failed to clear a ball solidly in their goal area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Liam Sanchez-Barreto took the ball and drilled in a 12-foot shot to knot the contest up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We were tentative early, and Maloney brought a physical game," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; "As the game went on, we rose to the challenge and battled for every ball.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second half was even for the first ten minutes but soon after, Eastern began to dominate play.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers' back line of Landon Gawel, Sam LaMar, Rio Fernandez and Jesh Portillo thwarted Maloney's attack in and around midfield with Eastern moving the ball quickly on the wings.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at 21:57 of the second stanza, Rocco Barbino took a Sanchez-Barreto through ball, beat his man and the goalie - scoring the game winner, making it 2-1. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had a few close calls offensively over the next ten minutes and then Maloney began to throw everyone forward on attack in an attempt to tie things up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In the last six minutes, Maloney had a few corners and bursts down our flanks, but goalie Peyton Cummings came up with one outstanding save on laser shot by Cardentey and Aiden Collins shut down a threatening breakaway with a smooth tackle," said Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the end, Eastern went to the pay window with its 2-1 triumph over Maloney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cummings scooped in five saves as did Logan Brazel in the Spartans’ net. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern travels to Lewis Mills on Friday for a 3:45 p.m. game in a CCC South tilt.</p>
