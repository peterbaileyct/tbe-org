<p>Come Sunday morning, the clocks will have been turned ahead an hour and I will have stopped ranting about why, “Why do we need to play around with the clocks?” “Why not just leave them alone?” “Why, why, why?” And Mary will nod and nothing will change, except the clocks, and I will tuck away in the back of my mind a few news stories that address some of the effects of changing the clock two times a year, in most instances, they cite more depressive episodes during the weeks following the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the record, I am a proponent of standard time, no time changes, simple going with the flow.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even with the time change the weekend turned out pretty well, since Mary and I had a visit from one of the kids and the latest grandbaby, just about three months old. Off and on I have joked about baby smiles being the result of gas—and, now, on the record, I state that his little smiles, not because of gas, but because of eye contact, listening to and responding to all those baby talk phrases, “Who is a cute little baby?” and all the rest. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a visit to Great Grandmother Nana and Uncle Jim, Nana asked, “What is it with babies these days? They are so alert.” Which makes me wonder what my brothers and I were like as babies! Ha! &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, babies are a joy, especially when news from Ukraine is so filled with despair. I have turned more and more to news reports of the Russian invasion. I follow the with increasing disbelief, that something like this is happening in 2022. At the same time, I have become more and more aware that that these conflicts are more frequent than I would have liked to admit—that there has been a war raging in Easter Ukraine for the past decade, that people in Syria are reeling from the aftereffects of the Arab Spring, the ongoing tension in the Middle East, Sudan, Myanmar, and on and on. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, when I refer to ongoing tension, a euphemism if ever there were one, what I am saying is that people are dying, the vast majority of them, innocents.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so, I try to keep this in mind, to be mindful, as I go along with my daily routines and even as I find myself tumbling headlong into March Madness, having dipped my toe into the water this weekend with the Indiana v. Iowa contest, while babysitting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And on into the week, one in which our local Bristol Central High boys basketball team continues on the road to the state finals. &nbsp;</p>
