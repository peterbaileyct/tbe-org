<p>NEW BRITAIN - This may come as little solace for the Bristol Central football program but to end an amazing campaign, the Rams lost to the eventual state champions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, December 11, Maloney defeated Windsor by a 35-21 final to take the Class L championship in a showdown from Veterans Stadium at Willow Brook Park in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Third ranked Maloney finished the campaign at 12-1 while No. 5 Windsor fell to 11-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first state title in the long history of Spartans’ football.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s Josh Boganski rushed for 239 yards on 46 huge carries - scoring four touchdowns along the way over an MVP caliber performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans trailed 7-0 in the early going and needed nearly 16 minutes to finally put a dent on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But over a stretch of about 14 minutes, Maloney scored four times to snare a 28-7 cushion with 6:08 to go in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Warriors were never able to play catch-up in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor managed a rally of its own, trimming the deficit to 28-21 with 11:20 remaining but never scored again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing by seven midway through the second frame, Maloney knotted the score on a 5-yard run by Boganski and with 8:13 left in the first half, it was a 7-7 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ensuing Windsor drive then stalled out on its own 39 and from there, Boganski ran in a TD from six yards out and with 29 seconds left in the second stanza, the Spartans snared a 14-7 push with halftime looming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off an interception by Maloney’s Kuron Wiggins early in the third tilt, deep in Windsor territory, Boganski scored on an 11-yard run to propel the Spartans to a 21-7 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney grew the lead to 28-7 via a 5-yard run by Boganski with 6:08 remaining in the third quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors then scored twice in just over a stretch of 2:20 and on an 87-yard pass play from Windsor QB Elijah Cromartie to Shawn Bell, it was just a seven-point contest at 28-21 with 11:20 to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney quarterback Angel Arce (4-for-10, 47 yards) then put together an insurance 15-yard TD run with 8:51 remaining, making it a 35-21 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deficit was too big to topple in the end for Windsor as Maloney racked up its first CIAC title in football over the 35-21 win.</p>
