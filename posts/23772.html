<p>MANSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS – Tyler Arbuckle of the Saint Anselm College men's basketball program in Manchester, New Hampshire has put together a tremendous senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol standout recently earned First Team All-Conference honors from the Northeast-10 due to his outstanding play over the 2022-23 season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior shooting guard/small forward, is a first-time All-Conference pick after scholastically starring at both Bristol Eastern and St. Paul Catholic – dropping in over 900 points.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 29 contests for the Hawks this year, Arbuckle is averaging 17.9 points-per-game, second in NE10 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been a scoring machine over the second half of the season for St. Anselm.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since hitting for just nine points in a showdown against American International on December 8, Arbuckle has scored in double figures in every contest from that time on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s tallied 14 games of 20 or more points this year. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle has&nbsp;played 40 minutes in over a dozen games for St. Anselm this season and since January 18, he’s gone the distance in all but two contests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Averaging 37.3 minutes-per-game, he’s tenth in the NCAA Division II standings in minutes played per game this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Arbuckle’s shooting nearly 50-percent from the field, canning 186-of-380 shots for a slick 48.9 clip – good for eighth place in the NE10. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He&nbsp;continues to excel behind the three-point stripe as his 43.4-percent tally is one of the best marks in the league, hitting 59-of-136 shots from deep.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the charity stripe, the senior has attempted 132 free throws which is the third most in NE10 play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle&nbsp;reached the 1,000-point barrier back on Jan. 21 in the Hawks’ 73-68 victory over Southern Connecticut State in New Hampshire, a tremendous accomplishment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s played extremely well for the program in southern New Hampshire since leaving Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, Arbuckle played in 21 games – all starting assignments – averaging 12.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists-per-game for the Hawks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scored 22 points and nabbed nine rebounds at Jefferson on December 18, 2021, while draining 31 three-pointers that year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle matched that scoring total on January 25 at Saint Rose on January 25, dropping in six-of-11 field goals from beyond the arc over another 22-point scoring barrage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During his&nbsp;freshman campaign, which commenced just before the pandemic, Arbuckle played and started in all 29 games, averaging 14.3 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished his first season ranked 15th in the NE10 with a 1.43 assist-to-turnover ratio and was ninth in the league with 363 field goals attempted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle made his collegiate debut versus Concordia on November 8, 2019, putting himself on the collegiate map just three games into his St. Anselm’s career.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle notched a season-high 31 against Saint Michael's from Manchester on November 13, shooting 11-for-16 overall from the field which included six three-pointers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle finished the year with 11 or more points over 10 of his final 11 games while dropping in at least one three-pointer in all but five games.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned NE10 Rookie of the Week honors for the weeks of November 18, December 2, January 6 and February 10 over a tremendous start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had an eventful scholastic career which included a change of schools after sustaining a bad knee injury.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a freshman from Bristol Eastern, Arbuckle played in nine games for the Lancers and put together a huge effort in the squad’s first round Class L showdown against eventual champion Bunnell - the last time the Lancers ventured into the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Playing in a season-high 17 minutes, he came off the bench to score 10 points, hitting three 3-pointers along the way, while also scooping up three rebounds and two assists over a tough 61-55 loss in Stratford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bunnell won the Class L championship that season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arbuckle&nbsp;then put together a tremendous sophomore campaign at Eastern before a knee injury ended his season prematurely.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In seven games, Arbuckle pumped in 18.6 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.0 rebounds-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 20 three-pointers in just seven games led the team. He shot 43.5-percent from three-point territory while canning 80-percent of his free throws in his shortened season&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a junior, he transferred to St. Paul Catholic for two seasons in which the Falcons made the playoffs both years while Arbuckle earned plenty of postseason season honors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then moved on to Taft before landing at St. Anselm. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
