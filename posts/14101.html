<p>BRISTOL - Over its first four Zone 1 games this year, the Bristol senior American Legion baseball program will be getting two very important games out of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team from Meriden, like last season, is poised to be a good one and should give Bristol good battles this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the team just came together recently because several of its players were on the Maloney and Southington baseball teams who were in the Class LL and L title games while another one of its players, John Remillard, won a championship with St. Paul Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means chemistry has yet to be established and, frankly, now is the time to take on Meriden while the outfit is still putting all of its pieces together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That Meriden team is a good one,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “[Coach] Doug [Wedge] told me they only had their first practice [this past] Saturday because most of their kids were playing in high school in playoffs. They’ve got some guys that can hit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first encounter between the teams this past Sunday, Bristol pitcher Roberto Cruz allowed just a single run as Post 2 spoiled&nbsp;Meriden’s debut by an 8-1 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rematch between the Zone 1 squads takes place on Thursday at 5:45 p.m., again from the friendly confines of Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz limited Post 45 to just three total hits while four errors did not help the team in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as the games roll along, expect vast improvement from the squad representing Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re going to be better at the end of the season,” said LaPenta of Meriden. “I’d rather play them early especially because [on Sunday], it was their first game. They were a little rusty.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just under a month, Bristol is going to have one heck of a time when Post 2 travels to Meriden on July 10 for a doubleheader against the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That doubleheader takes place from Ceppa Field, starting at 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Post 45 is going to poise serious trouble around Zone 1 once that program shows any kind of chemistry and continuity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“By the end of the year, they’ll be a decent team,” said LaPenta. “They have some tough players and Doug does a really good job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the meantime, Bristol has played well to start the 2022 campaign – splitting games against Meriden and West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"1-1 after the first two zone games, I'll take it," said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
