<p>Police were initially notified of a post by a parent, David Arroyo Jr. of New Britain, on Hubbell Elementary School's parent portal expressing his dissatisfaction with the school administration's handling of an issue.<br><br>Later in the day, Arroyo called the Bristol Police via 911. When asked by the dispatcher the address of the emergency, Arroyo said it was going to be the school. Arroyo, according to a police release, also posted a video of his interaction with the 911 operator on Facebook, which prompted calls to the police department.<br><br>Responding officers found Arroyo in the parking lot and the school in lockdown. Arroyo was placed under arrest and charged with breach of peace. He is being held on bond for court. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
