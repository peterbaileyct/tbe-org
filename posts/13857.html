<p>BRISTOL - Can an already crazy campaign by the Bristol Eastern softball team get any zanier in 2022?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It certainly could if the No. 21 ranked Lancers - the lowest remaining seed in the CIAC tournament this year - knocks off No. 1 Masuk of Monroe on Monday in a Class L semifinal showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has already silenced its doubters with wins over Brookfield, Jonathan Law, and East Haven - all on the road - and can do the same by taking out the Panthers from a neutral site in West Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it was a strikeout by ace chucker Ali Tellier or a game-winning hit from Alex Shorette, the Lancers have the tools to give Masuk a real run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers are looking for its fourth straight Class L title but will have to do so against a nothing-to-lose Eastern program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters could be on the cusp of returning to the Class L state tournament championship game for the first time since 2010 and here’s a quick look at Eastern’s showdown against No. 1 seeded Masuk:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L Semifinal - No. 1 Masuk (24-1) versus No. 21 Bristol Eastern (13-10)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Location: </strong>West Haven High School</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When: </strong>Monday, June 6</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Road to the semis (Masuk)</strong>: The top-ranked Panthers played just twice in the postseason after buzzing all the competition in regular season play and the SWC Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masuk blanked No. 17 North Haven by a 4-0 final on June 1 and two days later, the Panthers held off No, 9 St. Joseph (2-1) to make back to the semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Road to the semis (Bristol Eastern)</strong>: The Lancers have been the surprise of state tournament play, taking out several superior challengers - in least in the seeding sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After taking out No. 12 Brookfield to open the Class Ls, Eastern upset No. 5 Law (5-4) on June 1 and two days later, late game heroics from the Lancers spun the bracket upside down again with a 9-7 win over No. 4 East Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let the upsets continue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coaches</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Masuk - </strong>Leigh Barone</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern - </strong>Tyler Catlin (first season as Eastern’s head coach)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Division</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Masuk - </strong>The Panthers compete in the SWC</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern - </strong>The Lancers are a proud member of the CCC</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll Rankings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Masuk - </strong>In the last poll from May 31, Masuk was ranked second with a then record of 22-1.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern -</strong> The Kingstreeters weren’t even in the ‘happy to get a vote’ category in the GameTimeCT poll but Eastern has proven to be a giant killer none-the-less without all the fanfare, accolades, and rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s the Deal for the Lancers?</strong> Catlin told everyone that Eastern was going to be one of those the mid-level seeded programs that opponents did not want to play against in the Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That assessment was not only correct but a loud proclamation few teams heeded and when you don’t notice what’s in front of you, that’s when all sorts of tomfoolery takes place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wars of the CCC battle-tested the Lancers over a 20-game slate, and the rollercoaster of a regular season ride, has produced a 3-0 postseason ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t any easy road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point of the campaign, the Lancers were 5-7 off a winnable 3-1 setback at Bristol Central on May 6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Kingstreeters have won eight of its last 11 games - outscoring opponents 19-13 in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s senior core of six players strong - Sarah Sneaker, Alex Shorette, Sam Policki, Grace D’Amato and the outstanding battery of catcher Janessa Gonzalez and pitcher All Tellier - have been the driving force behind this postseason run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier is not only pitching the Lancers to wins but also hitting well at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several of the runs she given up during postseason play have been of the unearned variety and Tellier is simply throwing strikes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And how many more game-winning hits is Shorette going to serve up in postseason action?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her play in centerfield has been noteworthy as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every Eastern player has contributed to this amazing run as Ashely Serafin, Tellier, and Shorette have been smashing out home runs in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Round-trippers have been in large supply at Eastern this year and that’s the danger opposing pitchers must deal with daily against Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato, Emily Valentine, Grace and Jazmyn Brown, and even Hailey Beebe have contributed to this season’s amazing run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, this Eastern program has been nothing less than resilient over this three-game stretch of postseason games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, Eastern led 4-0 over East Haven, eventually saw the showdown tied up at 7-7 before Shorette’s game-winning hit and Tellier’s eighth inning heroics sealed the deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What’s the Deal for the Panthers? </strong>Eastern has not played a team like Masuk in either regular or postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers have won four straight Class L championships for a reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team just recently wrapped up the SWC title by defeating Brookfield 12-0 (beating Brookfield is something both Class L semifinalists have in common).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masuk, since opening the season with a loss to Fairfield Ludlowe, has won 24 straight games coming into Monday’s showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers have done just enough to advance in postseason play in terms of scoring, netting only six runs, but allowing just one on the flip side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That defense is partially due to pitcher Kat Gallant whose has been simply tremendous this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Helping Masuk to its fifth straight conference title this season, Gallant allowed just four hits over 21 innings of work in SWC Tourney play - going 3-0 overall while fanning 40 batters and allowing just one unearned run over that stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s tallied over 500 strikeouts and the Villanova bound senior is going to give Eastern batters fits at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gallant’s partner on the other side of the battery, Izzy Viglione, has home run power from the plate while Natalie Lieto can also hit the ball all over the park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it’s acknowledged that Masuk is one of the premier programs in the state of Connecticut - hands down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers have been playing with house money and have already taken out two opponents in the top-10 poll - collecting all the rewards that have come with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to be an epic challenge to top Masuk but underestimating what the Kingstreeters have accomplished this year could be costly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scholastic sport of softball is alive and well in the city of Bristol in the year 2022 and Eastern is a big part of that success.</p>
