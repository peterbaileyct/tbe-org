<p>Over his 65-year career he mentored many people and made many friends along the way. He volunteered in his spare time serving on the Burlington Board of Finance for 46 years. His only other passion was skiing which he discovered at age 50 and continued until age 80.</p>

<p>We will miss our Patriarch, our rock. We will miss the guy who skied way too fast for his age and renewed his driver's license for eight years at age 95. We will miss the guy who expected a lot from us but gave so much more in return. We will cherish all the memories but especially "Friday nights" with all the conversation and laughter.  </p>

<p>Fred is predeceased by his wife Beryl Chard, son Frederick J. Chard, Ill, and sister Kathleen Cayer. He leaves his daughters Donna Gaski and husband Peter of Burlington, Mary Ellen Paul and husband Ronald of Burlington and his son James Chard and wife Cheryl of Burlington. He will be missed by his seven grandchildren (Jennifer Luoni, Robert Paul, Stephanie Gaski, Adam Gaski, Ashley Dinella, Derek Chard and Frederick J. Chard, IV), six great grandchildren (Sophia Luoni, Samantha Luoni, Carson Gaski, Caleb Gaski, Frederick J. Chard, V, Luca Dinella and Luna Gaski Hernandez, nieces, nephews and cousins.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
