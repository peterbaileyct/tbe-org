<p>A day filled with entertainment, activities, food and fun is coming to Bristol this Saturday as the first ever Family Fun Day premiers at BAIMS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be a nice way to get the kids out of the house and doing something for fun, and it’s free,” said Making Bristol Better Parent Ambassador Jennifer St. John. “There’s going to be so much to do and it’s going to be a blast.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hosted at the scenic Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School (BAIMS) on Saturday, Aug. 5 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., this community celebration offers an array of family-friendly activities and entertainment, including a foam party, magician, DJ and face painting. The event will be held rain or shine. </p>

<p>Attendees can savor a diverse selection of cuisine and sweet treats from popular local vendors, including Spot on Tacos, Kraftwich Foodtruck, Greer's Chicken, Darens Ice Cream and Cookie Dough Cookies. St. John stated that the organizers of the event will be providing some guests with food vouchers worth $4-$5 that can be used on the day of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re going to be giving food vouchers to the first 400 people that come in. They’re going to be available to use at any of the food trucks on that day only. Thanks to our sponsors we were able to raise extra money to provide the vouchers. We’ll also be handing out t-shirts for the first 50 kids that come in.”</p>

<p>Children will have the opportunity to learn more about larger transports and emergency vehicles during the touch-a-truck event. Younger guests will have the opportunity to explore real trucks from Skytop Motors, D'Amato Construction, Gaski Energy and multiple trucks from the Bristol Fire Department. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Bristol Fire Department are one of the coordinators and Chief Hart has been amazing,” said St. John. “There will be a fire engine, a ladder truck and the Barnes Fire Safety truck.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An exciting experience awaits attendees at 11:30 a.m., when a SkyHealth helicopter will make a grand landing on the BAIMS field. The helicopter will remain on site for the remainder of the event so that the children can get a closer look at the rotorcraft. The landing is contingent upon the absence of any health emergencies, as the helicopter serves as an active medical transport.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I would recommend that people come early to see the helicopter land,” said St. John. “It’s not every day that you get see a helicopter land in a field. It’s going to be such a cool thing; I’m excited about it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event will be presented by Making Bristol Better, a local nonprofit that includes the Bristol Early Childhood Alliance and Bristol School Readiness Council, in partnership with United Way of West Central Connecticut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
