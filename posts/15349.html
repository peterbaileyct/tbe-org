<p>She enjoyed music, being outdoors, travel, and was an avid reader who would devour her books.  Her greatest joy in life was her family. She loved her children and took an active role in their sports as their biggest cheerleader. She was a devoted wife, mother, daughter, sister and friend who, despite her little feet, has left huge shoes that can never be filled. </p>
