<p>The Bristol Central boys track and field team put on an incredible performance at Saturday’s Greater Hartford Invitational Track Meet, finishing with 75 points to win the team championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an exceptionally strong field, Central won all three relays and BC’s Kenny Whitford won the pole vault.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Tamara Stafford commented, “This was a full team effort. Whitford was joined by Captain Jude Browning, Wyatt Gibson, Jack Jones, Any Paulino, Will Postell &amp; Nate Davis in the field events and they scored a ton of points. Captains Patrick Wininger and Cassias Breland led a group of guys determined to show the state who we are in the relays. Rowan Hennessy, Isaiah Fabrizio, Julieen Lopez, Aiden &amp; Noah Georgakopoulos, and Nate Davis all ran strong relay legs today. I’m really proud of the boys for stepping up today!”</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
