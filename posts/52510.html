<p><strong>Victor Rosa</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Victor Rosa, one of UConn football’s leading offensive players the past two seasons, will be a welcome addition for the team when he returns from an injury. The team is currently doing will with a strong offense he can only make better.</p>

<p><strong>Nicknames</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are mine for some of my friends:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dave “Rap” Raponey: He’s been a good rapper, especially with regards to baseball rapping songs. Don “Sure is Swell” Zurell: He has been there for me with health issues. His wife, Noreen, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there is Don “The Pro” Provost as “Don The Pro” Vost. Actually, there’s no such thing as a “Vost.” I probably should erase the Provost segment but need space to cover here. Don owns the license plate “Don Pro.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about Gary “The Pal” Palladino, who I plan to call tonight. He and I keep up with one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doris Miles Disney</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doris was a well-known mystery writer who was born in Glastonbury. She lived here at one time and in Plainville. Now deceased, she was an aunt of my friend Goerge Tolve of Bristol. There also was a second Doris Disney who wrote books and gained many followers.</p>

<p>This has been a good week for me regarding my military friends. I just got off of the phone with Neal Supranovich, a veteran and veterans' advocate. We talked about Joe Caminiti who turned 100 years old, and all of the many things going on for him lately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Retired Marine Corps Colonel Ed Cercone called me from Virginia where he lives, and we talked about Joe and other topics. Neal gave me the phone number for Dick Fitz, who is 99, and a Navy WWII veteran. I’ll call him later today to chat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shout outs </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To the red-headed Don Titus, Joe Caminiti, Carol Denehy, Patti Kalat (Not Bob) and Hank Lodge. Hank sent me a recent email and to answer him -- I’m hanging in there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the go</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jim Kane, the late father of the Jim and Billy Kane, was a man on the go in Bristol for many years. Men like him have helped make Bristol the town it is today. John Smith and John Lodovico are made of the same cloth -- Thank goodness!</p>
