<p>With their sixteenth victory of the season, the St. Paul baseball team became the NVL Iron Division Champions for 2023 Monday afternoon with an 18-6 win over Watertown.</p>

<p>The St. Paul offense scored early and often in this game. Starter Kyle Wilson picked up his 5th win on the season for the Falcons while Jack McCloskey took the loss for Watertown.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Jamie Leggett singled in the top of the 1st, three consecutive walks to Devin Kulas, Cal Chance, and Cole Raymond brought Leggett home with the first run of the game. A two RBI double by Jonathan Remillard was followed by a two RBI single by AJ Corrado, and St. Paul led 5-0 after half an inning.</p>

<p>But that lead evaporated quickly as Jack McCloskey, Tino Tanganelli, and Nick Bristol (RBI) all singled to start the bottom of the frame. A two RBI single by Boden Stanton made it 5-3. An infield error made it 5-4, and an RBI double by Vin Tanganelli tied the score at 5-5 after one inning.</p>

<p>The St. Paul offense came roaring back in the top of the 2nd. Logan Rembish doubled to start the frame, advanced and scored on wild pitches, and the Falcons recaptured the lead 6-5. Back-to-back walks to Leggett and Kulas put two men on, and Chance had an RBI single to make it 7-5. Cole Raymond blasted a 3-2 pitch over the right field wall, and St. Paul regained its five run lead 10-5. </p>

<p>McCloskey was done for the day for Watertown, but St. Paul was not done for the inning. After reliever Boden Stanton hit batters Ryan Kilpatrick and AJ Corrado, Keaton Kroll drove them both home with a two RBI single. Kroll stole 2nd, and came home on Rembish's RBI single to give St Paul a 13-5 lead.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watertown got a run back when Tino Tanganelli homered to right with 1 out in the bottom of the second. But that was all the scoring that Watertown would have this day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilson settled down to retire the Watertown batters 1-2-3 in the 3rd, and reliever Mitch Crowley held Watertown scoreless over the final 2 innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Singles by Corrado, Rembish, and Leggett coupled with 2 Watertown errors allowed St Paul to tack on 5 more runs in the 4th, and the final was 18-6.</p>
