<p>Come Sunday morning, UConn men’s basketball team will have broken away from Illinois at half time and never looked back. For a while in that first half, it looked like the Huskies might be victims of that inertia that strikes at some point when a certain weariness sets in. Not so. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The UConn women’s team battles on after Duke. They wil be heading into a contest with top-seeded USC. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fingers crossed, hoping things keep going UConn’s way.</p>

<p>And Sunday will be Easter. Our contribution this year? Mary will have made Jay's Italian Ricotta cookies from a recipe by an old friend who is no longer with us. The cookies have become a tradition. Me? I will have pre-made the lasagna, which will be one of the main entrees. On Saturday, the grandkids and parents colored eggs. Mass is in the morning.</p>

<p>Picking up where he left off at the end of the last year, earlier on Saturday, C.T. O'Brien presented a second live program in his BRXSTOL immersive project, this time at the Bristol Public Library. No time here to recap what's happening but take a minute to head over the BRXSTOL website for the story and challenge. Click <a href="https://www.brxstol.com/home">here</a>. </p>

<p>Reading and listening this week starts with something a little different. The Ones &amp; Tooze podcast tackles "The Economic Thinking of Pope Francis." To have one of the premier modern thinkers, Columbia University professor Adam Tooze, address a pope's thinking about the economy is fairly unique. Typically, a pope addressing the economy is simply dismissed perfunctorily.

<p>And for reading, I have been dipping into a book by Jiddu Krishnamurti, "Commentaries on Living: Issues confronting every man and woman--interpreted with deep insight by one of the world's spiritual leaders." How's that for a title.  I picked up the book browsing at Worthwhile Read, Bristol's bookstore located at the end of Richmond Place and find that the book is becoming part of my morning routine--the chapters are short and provide a way to center before the day unfolds.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The purchase is kind of fun, not only because the book is terrific but also because inside the book I found a postcard, cordially inviting the recipient to attend an exhibition presented by The Cooper Union, "For the Advancement of Science and Art," from March 28 to April 30, 1957, in the window galleries of East River Saving Bank at Rockefeller Plaza.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recipient is a Miss Margaret A. Smith of 420 East 55th Street, New York 22, N.Y.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for Krishnamurti, he was an internationally known thinker, writer and speaker (with a huge presence on YouTube, for the curious). I was introduced to some of his writings in high school and I continue to dip into them from time to time.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
