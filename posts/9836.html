<p>BRISTOL – Down twenty points to Central Connecticut Conference Interdivisional foe Edwin O. Smith, the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team chopped the deficit to single digits before falling by a 51-40 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the opening contest for both squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were leading by five early in the second stanza before the Panthers unleashed a 29-4 run to capture a 40-20 edge with 4:06 to go in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern went for broke as back-to-back lay-ups from Ciara Collins and Taigan Parent – part of a 20-8 Lancers’ burst – made it a 48-40 game with 39 seconds to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern simply ran out of time in the end, eventually dropping the contest by 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m pleased about the way they played and came back and didn’t pack it in,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “They fought all to the way at the end down here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins dropped in a game-high 22 points and collected 10 rebounds for a season opening double-double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent scored seven of her career-high nine points over second half play while also swiping four steals that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens also snagged four steals to go along with seven points and two rebounds while Janessa Gonzalez added two points and seven rebounds for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith loomed big over Eastern’s scrappy squad as the visitors cashed in on 14 offensive rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lilli Clark dropped in 21 points, Maddie Hughes added seven while back-up center Bella Mallory – also hitting the glass with zest – had six points and several rebounds off the pine as the bigger Panthers enjoyed their height advantage on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith also had steady play out of point guard Oliva Verboven (six points) while Clair Greene canned two three-pointers, leading to eight points, for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re really a good team,” said Floyd of Smith. “They’re probably in the top five or top six [of the state]. They have some very good inside players. I thought they did a very good job. They’re huge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern went toe-to-toe against Smith in the first frame as Collins cashed in on three three-pointers with her final trifecta giving the Kingstreeters a 13-11 edge through eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They came out and played very well,” said Floyd of Eastern. “[Smith] tried to [match our] play but we executed well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 6:04 to go in the second tilt, Collins found Stavens for a huge three-point bomb as Eastern roped up a 16-11 lead as the offense was flowing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Eastern had trouble advancing the ball up the court as Smith went to full-court pressing tactics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers forced several consecutive miscues – leading to a period ending 18-3 jaunt – as the home team trailed 29-18 at intermission as Smith created offense via the turnovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We just fell into a little lull where we just turned the ball over four times in a row,” said Floyd of the pivotal second period. “We didn’t make a basket and they went up about ten points. That got their momentum going [into the half].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were cold shooting from the field in the third tilt as Smith maintained its defensive stance, with Eastern connecting on just one basket in the quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Hughes hit a charity shot with 4:06 left in the frame, Eastern trailed by twenty at 40-20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the third quarter, they really came at us again” with pressure said Floyd of Smith. “We didn’t attack the press until later on.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the home team eventually went 10-for-10 from the free throw line – sandwiched around a Collins hoop which was set up nicely by Parent – and with 6:36 to go in the bout, Eastern was hanging around at 42-30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the fourth quarter, we started doing a great job breaking the press, attacking, making some lay-ups and kids were filling the lanes,” said Floyd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith then started to stall, Eastern continued to hit a foul shot here and there but even as Parent drained a late three and Collins canned a free throw, it was still a double-figure game at 48-36 with 1:54 left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern went for broke as Collins dropped in a hoop and off a quick turnover, Parent connected on a lay-up and with about forty seconds to go, the Lancers trimmed the deficit to 48-40.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the ensuing play, Hughes found Clark for a quick lay-up and Eastern never got it back to single digits again as the Panthers came away with a big 51-40 season opening win from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were right there” in the end said Floyd. “We [just] didn’t play a whole good game. We played two-and-a-half [to three] good quarters. That [second] quarter hurt us.”</p>

<h2>Rim Dust: Bristol Eastern’s Lauren Ayotte hits game-winning free throw as Lancers’ JV squad defeats E.O. Smith.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"fontSize":"normal"} -->
<h2 class="has-normal-font-size">The Bristol Eastern girls JV basketball team trailed late in its contest against Edwin O. Smith on Tuesday before a little clutch foul shooting by Amanda Noel and Lauren Ayotte eventually helped the Lancers steal the game away from the Panthers.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it took some doing because Smith held all the momentum over the final period of play but could not close out the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern trailed 25-19 to open the fourth period but the Kingstreeters allowed Smith just five points over the final eight minutes of regulation as defense ruled the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers led 30-28 with less than a minute to play when Eastern attacked the hoop as Noel was fouled with 30.1 seconds remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She coolly sank two charity tosses to make it a 30-30 game as the visiting aggression quickly called for time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers then used some clock to set up their offense but missed a high-percentage shot and with 10.7 second left, Eastern was charging down the court – looking for a game-winning hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late three-pointer missed and after a scrum, Ayotte ended up with the offensive rebound and flung the ball at the hoop as the buzzer sounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The attempt missed but a foul was called on the play – sending Ayotte to the line for two shots, needing just one to win the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All alone at the free throw stripe due to the clock showing all zeros across the board, Ayotte calmly dropped in the first free throw toss as Eastern seized a sweet 31-30 come-from-behind victory to open the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first win for Eastern JV coach Beth Lafferty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Leah Roy was the only double-figure scorer of the game as she dropped in 13 points while Noel added four of her six points over fourth period play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury and Madison Charette each scored four points to the till while Ayotte notched three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Collins passes Chapman in all-time scoring</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When senior sensation Ciara Collins hit two free throws with 5:01 to play in the second period, she passed Tami Chapman for sixth place all-time in points scored at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chapman tallied 1,045 points over her career and Collins needed just 13 points to move up the Eastern scoring ladder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins notched 22 points and now has 1,055 career points – looking to pass one of her favorite coaches, Ginny Torreso (Ziogas), over the next few games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso scored 1,134 points for the Lancers and Collins needs just 79 to tie her for fifth place all-time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Learning their roles</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s going to take a little time for Eastern’s players to develop some court chemistry this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But once that chemistry takes a hold of the Lancers’ program, the locals are going to be in particularly decent shape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the duo of Taigan Parent and Emma Stavens made a total of eight starts over the pandemic shortened campaign – seeing considerable time off the bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, both athletes are in the starting line-up this season, a position they both will be in for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Edwin O. Smith in Eastern’s 51-40 season-opening loss, the duo showed flashes on both offense and defense abilities that will help the squad win games down the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Taigan and Emma were really coming off the bench last year,” said Eastern coach Tony Floyd. “Some games they started for half the year. But I thought they did a good job for the first time [starting] and coming out here and taking on their new roles.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Same goes for senior Janessa Gonzalez who truly is the squad’s only inside enforcer after Collins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez will push players around, grab several big rebounds, stick a jumper here and there and block shots in and around the paint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s another important cog to any chance Eastern has of doing well this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Janessa has really stepped it up this year on the boards,” said Floyd. “She’s physical. She’s done a great job playing good defense out there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Piendak (two rebounds) also got her first varsity start on Tuesday and played a ton of minutes against the Panthers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As she gets a little more confidence on the court, Piendak will fill an invaluable role at the forward position for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Emily Piendak came out and did a great job,” against Smith said Floyd. “I was pleased. That’s her first year playing out there as a junior and I was able to get a couple young kids in there [as well].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noel and Leah Roy earned a few minutes throughout the contest, making contributions here and there to keep the Lancers hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s vital that Eastern gets something from the bench this season to augment the play of the Lancers’ All-State performer in Collins and that starting unit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Leah Roy and Amanda Noel did a good job coming off the bench,” said Floyd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Floyd hopes to develop Noel, Roy and Vanessa Drury as the season unfolds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there won’t be any letup come Friday as Eastern travels to Windsor for a tough CCC Interdivisional showdown on the road.</p>
