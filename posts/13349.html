<p>BRISTOL – The East Hartford baseball team jumped all over Bristol Eastern in the sixth inning on Tuesday – roping up six runs over a whirlwind frame of play – as the Lancers fell to the Hornets by a 10-5 final from Muzzy Field in a CCC Interdivisional contest from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hornets improved to 4-13 overall while the Kingstreeters fell to 5-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The action started early as Eastern starting pitcher Ryan Maglio hit Xavier Quiles with a pitch to open the game but the pitcher retired the next three batters he faced to escape the jam without allowing a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But things turned in the top of the second as Sam Montovani started the inning with a single, moved to third on an error off a botched a pick-off attempt, and scored on a balk to make it a 1-0 game.<br>The Lancers tied the contest in the bottom of the tilt when Elliot Norris (two singles, one run) jammed an RBI single to center as Rio Fernandez, who walked with one gone, came around to score to make it a 1-1 stalemate.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Hornets notched two runs in the third tilt to seize the edge in the game for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A one-out walk, followed by an RBI&nbsp;triple down the right field line by Jaiden Rodriguez, gave the visitors a run and then an RBI single from Cody Segarra made it a 3-1 game through three.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford added a run in the top of the fifth as a single, a balk, a sacrifice, and an RBI base hit by Segarra propelled the visiting aggression to a 4-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers struck back in the bottom of the fifth to trim the deficit in half as Norris singled with one gone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conor McCormick then flew out to center but the throw from the outfield, trying to double up Norris, went wild for an error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris went to third on the play and later scored on a passed ball, making it a 4-2 game as Eastern was hanging around through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth, the Hornets put the event away, scoring six unearned runs to&nbsp;seize a 10-2 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the bases loaded and two outs, a three run double by Jaiden Rodriguez made it 7-2 game and ended Maglio's day on the mound.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Nocera relieved Maglio but three straight hits scored the final three runs of the contest as the Hornets led it by eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montovani chucked a solid six innings for East Hartford but put Eastern’s first two runners on base to start the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As he reached his pitching limit, Montovani was relieved by Segarra who generated a quick out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But an infield error led to two runs while Ben D'Amato RBI’s single added another tally to the scoreboard as Eastern chopped the deficit to 10-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dom Laduca then relieved Segarra, posting two strikeouts to end the game, as the Lancers’ late comeback was halted, leading to East Hartford’s five-run win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will be looking for victory number six on Wednesday as Eastern travels to Colt Park in Hartford to battle the Hartford Public/HMTCA co-op at 4:30 p.m.</p>
