<p>The Bristol Blues started the final week of the regular season with a tough in-state loss to the Danbury Westerners, dropping a 5-1 decision on Tuesday evening in New England Collegiate Baseball League action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, played from Rodgers Park in Danbury, saw the Blues (28-12) scoop up a 1-0 lead after six innings but could not maintain the edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Westerners (18-20) notched two runs in the seventh and added another three in the eighth to make it a four run game – good enough to stave off the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Alec Couture ended up drawing the loss in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 2.1 innings, allowed two hits, one earned run while striking out four over a very good effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Couture did not walk a batter but just couldn’t pitch his way out of the seventh stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Bristol Eastern standout Jagger Duquette did not yield a run in his stint on the hill over the third and fourth frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He walked three and struck out two as he improved his ERA to 1.38 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads ended up with six hits apiece but Danbury made its late hits count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calvin McCall led the Bristol charge at the plate, going 2-for-4, while Dante D’Amore (two walks) scored the lone run for the Blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored its run in the top of the third to claim a 1-0 lead but couldn’t sustain that advantage in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Bowery earned the win out of the bullpen for the Westerners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went five innings, gave up just three hits, walked none and struck out four over a big time effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Arnone Griffin went 1-for-1 at the dish while Jay Harry, Derek Tenney, and Chaz Myers all tallied hits for the Blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game, which took 2:29 to play, had 484 fans witness Danbury get within two wins of .500 as the regular season comes to a close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol used six pitchers in the game with no chucker going more than two innings as the postseason in on the horizon.</p>

<h3>South Wins All-Star Game</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Sunday at the Shark Tank in Martha’s Vineyard, the 2022 NECBL All-Star game commenced with the squad from the Southern Division snaring a 13-2 win over its Northern counterparts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martha’s Vineyard catcher Thomas Bramley was named MVP as he smacked out two home runs – grabbing two RBI – to collect MVP honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Chaz Myers smacked out an RBI single in the fourth as the South grabbed a 13-2 lead after four completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither team scored again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The South led 5-2 halfway through the fourth inning before the wheels fell off on the North.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winners went for eight straight in the bottom of the fourth to snare that 11-run cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The North was held to five hits while the victors smashed out 18 hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Blues that afternoon, Jay Harry went 1-for-3 and scored a run while Myers was 1-for-2 with an RBI and two runs scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
