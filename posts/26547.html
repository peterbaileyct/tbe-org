<p>BRISTOL - In a game between the Avon and Bristol Eastern baseball programs last Thursday, one team was able to tally big hits while the other one did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that lack of a big hit cost the Lancers in the end as the squad fell to the Falcons by a 5-1 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon improved to 12-6 overall while Eastern fell to 5-12.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had only six hits for the day, scoring their lone run in the bottom of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Caleb Molinsky did a credible job on the mound for the first six innings before tiring and giving up three consecutive hits and two runs to start the seventh inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In four of the six frames, Molinsky was able to retire the first two batters and limited the scoring opportunities for Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the other innings is where the Falcons went on the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one out in the third inning of the scoreless game, Avon’s Michael Prisco and Chris Beloin singled to put two on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prisco scored on a two-out infield single to short by Connor Lavore and Beloin later tagged the dish on a wild pitch for a 2-0 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon picked up an unearned run in the fourth as a run scored on an infield error, making it a 3-0 contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Eastern’s&nbsp;Isaac Roberge walked with one out, went to second on a wild pitch, got to third on a groundout, and scored on Kyle Babin's perfect bunt base hit to the left side to trim the deficit to 3-1 as the home squad was hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon tacked on their final two runs in the seventh to snare a four-run cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prisco led off with a single to left,&nbsp;Beloin tripled to the gap in left center to drive in Prisco and a single to center scored Beloin - making it 5-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Declan Schenck then relieved Molinsky and got the final three outs to end the inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game wasn’t all one-sided as the Lancers were just one hit away from breaking the showdown open.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that hit simply didn’t come in the clutch despite Eastern setting the table to score runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt with two outs, Connor Cyr and Ben D'Amato singled but Avon starter Ethan Lavore posted a strikeout to end the inning.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth, when Eastern scored its lone run, two runners were left on base when Lavore again got a strikeout to end the frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixth stanza, the Kingstreeters had multiple men on base but just couldn’t push one home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error, a hit batter, and a base-on-balls loaded things up with two outs. But a K by Avon reliever Harry Engle ended the inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally&nbsp;in the seventh, trailing 5-1, Cyr singled to start the inning as the rally was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two away, Rio Fernandez was hit by a pitch - putting two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Engle generated a strikeout for the third out to end the game with Avon seizing a 5-1 win.&nbsp;</p>
