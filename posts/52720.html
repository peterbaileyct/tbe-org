<p>U.S. and state flags in Connecticut will be lowered today, Wednesday, Oct. 23, to half-staff in honor of Robert Sharkevich Sr., a member of the Wethersfield Volunteer Fire Department and former member of the Hartford Fire Department who died in the line of duty while responding to a brush fire at Lamentation Mountain in Berlin, Gov. Ned Lamont announced in a release earlier this morning.</p>

<p>Flags will remain lowered until sunset on the date of interment, which has not yet been determined. The Office of the Governor will send out a notification when flags should be returned to full staff.</p>

<p>“His selfless dedication to public service and the safety of his community and the surrounding towns is nothing less than heroic. On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I thank him for the service he has provided to our state, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues in the Wethersfield Volunteer Fire Department and Hartford Fire Department.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the governor’s directive, flags will be at half-staff on the Connecticut State Capitol building and all other state-operated buildings, grounds and facilities statewide. Individuals, businesses, schools, municipalities and any other private entities and government subdivisions are encouraged to lower their flags for this same duration of time. Since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all other flags, including state, municipal, corporate, or otherwise, should also be lowered.</p>
