<p>Donna Maria (Plachno) Konieczny, of Fort Pierce, Fla., formerly of Bristol, beloved Mom, Babcia, and friend passed away unexpectedly on Wednesday, Dec. 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donna (Danusia) was born on April 23 in Borzecin Dolny Poland to her wonderful parents, the late Stanislaus and Wiktoria (Rogoz) Plachno. Donna endured the horrors of World War II as a child; memories that stayed with her forever. After she completed her education in Krakow, she worked for the Polish Red Cross. A multiple year pen-pal friendship led to marriage to her adoring husband, Julian, who had immigrated to the United States from England, after surviving WWII.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donna joined her husband in United States, started a family, became a U.S. citizen, and with Julian, were devout and very active members of St. Stanislaus Church. Donna was part of the choir and Julian was a lecturer. Both worked very hard to provide the best for their two daughters, Bernadette, and Danuta. They made sure their children had the best education, learned the Polish language, traveled to Poland to know their extended family; raising them in a very loving and religious environment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donna was famous for her baking especially babka’s. Everyone was always welcome in their home. If someone needed help, she and Julian did what they could. They loved dancing, music, traveling, and attending the theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For health reasons, Donna and Julian moved to Florida in 1989, leaving behind many lasting friendships, beginning a new chapter. Retirement included many happy days at the beach, parties, and attending the many Churches in the area. As Julian’s health declined, Donna, was his devoted caretaker, until his passing. Although she missed her children and grandchildren, her health was best suited living in a warm climate. Donna passed away peacefully in her Florida home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was predeceased by her husband of 49 years, Julian; her youngest daughter and mom to her grandsons, Danuta; her brothers Tadeusz, and Czeslaw; and a brother and sister lost during WWII.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Left to miss her very much, her daughter, Bernadette Bartosch, and her husband Rich, and Rich’s mom, Margaret; the grandsons she was so proud of, Augie, and Toby Smith; her brother’s children, sweet niece, Dorothy Stone, and godson/nephew Stan Plachno, and their mother Irene; family in Poland and Italy; and so many friends (you know who you are) and her wonderful Florida neighbors. Practice kindness, take care of each other, live in peace.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
