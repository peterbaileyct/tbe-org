<p>Community members and friends gathered at Bakery on Maple on Thursday to show their support for the LGBTQ community with a raising of the rainbow flag and to commemorate the beginning of Pride Month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I really hope this shows the town of Bristol that you can let everybody in,” said Erika Stirk, who along with her husband, David Landi, owns and runs the artisanal bakery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You have to be open and welcoming to everybody in the community, not just the people you want to have come in, because we are all part of the community,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thursday marked the third consecutive year that the small business has displayed the pride flag in their window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is our statement,” said Landi. "We try as a business to make social statements. As businesses are part of the community, we should be able to say, ‘We love everybody in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In such a diverse town as this, it’s just nice to show everyone that they are welcome here in Bristol.”</p>

<p>“Pride Month is about a sense of belonging,” said Scott Rosado, a local business owner who was among those who turned out for the flag raising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s an investment in our community and staying connected with everyone. It’s about moving forward and letting everyone know that they’re welcome."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Rosado announced recently that he will be running as the Democratic candidate for mayor this November.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
