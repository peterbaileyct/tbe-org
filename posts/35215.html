<p>This past Saturday, the University of Connecticut football program hit the pay window for the first time this season - squaring up a 38-31 victory on the road against Rice from Houston, Texas on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win moved the Huskies to 1-5 overall while Rice (3-3 overall) lost at home for the first time in four tries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s own Victor Rosa rambled up a game-high 89 yards on 18 carries for UConn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He sprinted out a 20-yard rush, the longest on the afternoon for the Huskies, to keep the chains moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa also made a reception for eight yards and just missed out on a combined 100-yard day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn trailed 14-0 after one period but scored 20 points in the second to scoop up a 20-14 edge at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies led 28-14 early into the second half - enjoying the spoils of four turnovers - and then hung on in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Owls made it a 31-28 contest midway through the fourth but UConn quickly took a 10-point edge, and Rice never drew even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connecticut’s defense held in the end and UConn was a huge seven-point winner in Texas to - perhaps - jumpstart the remainder of the campaign.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rosa to date</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sophomore’s impressive numbers against Rice are right around his season average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, Rosa has compiled 399 yards on 75 rushes - good for a per game average of 5.3 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has two touchdowns on the campaign along with several receptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa has made seven catches for 51 yards, leading to an average of 7.3 yards-per-catch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a rough start to the 2023 season, Rosa numbers have improved by the game as the offense for the Huskies continues to make gains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After tallying just 51 yards over his first 19 carries, the speedster has exploded a bit over the last three weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the loss to Duke, Rosa made 14 carries for 68 yards and then posted 92 yards - on 15 rushes - in the 34-33 setback against Utah State.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Including the 89 yards in the win against Rice, Rosa has gained 249 yards on 47 carries (5.3 yards-per-carry) over the past three games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It appears Rosa and the Huskies are on the right path and expect another tremendous effort on October 21 when South Florida (3-3) invades the Nutmeg State.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford is the place for the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 3:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
