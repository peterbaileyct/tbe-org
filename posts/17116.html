<p>BRISTOL - Week one of the scholastic season for the Bristol Eastern football team started with promise but ended in outright disaster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were twenty points better than RHAM midway through the third tilt but penalties and missed opportunities foiled the Kingstreeters as the squad dropped a heartbreaking 23-20 decision from Alumni Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Penalties cost the Lancers over 130 yards and wiped out two touchdown scores by receiver Rayshon Andrews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Eastern can clean up those types of miscues, the squad has a chance to hang a loss on anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt, Easter’s opponent this week, fell at Berlin last week and both programs are looking to hit the pay window for the first time in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the deal in this Week 2 confrontation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (0-1) at Platt (0-1)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time: </strong>6:30 p.m. (Falcon Field in Meriden)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: Platt has been a long time Eastern opponent back from its CCIL days. Overall, the Panthers lead the series 33-23-1. This will be the 58th showdown between the schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Eastern win over Platt: </strong>Back on October 1, 2010 - on the way to the CIAC playoffs - Eastern scooped up a huge 28-20 victory over the Panthers. Since that win, Eastern is 0-5 against the team from Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week: </strong>Platt fell at Berlin (38-28) while Eastern was upset by RHAM (23-20).</p>

<p><strong>Game Facts: </strong>Berlin led 24-7 in its opening season contest against the Panthers and never let the cushion drop under double figures…Injuries might play a role in stopping the Panthers’ ground attack but the squad has a quarterback that can toss the ball all over the field…Senior quarterback Avery Robinson (15-for-24, 275 yards, two TDs at Berlin) will toss the ball to the likes of Kevin Acosta, Vittorio Church or Zack Baker…Injured back Amari Robinson has a broken hand but senior Corey Rogers can run the ball when called upon…This team has better strike ability than RHAM and can’t be underestimated…Eastern had RHAM’s collective number on both sides of the ball last week but those penalties and mistakes cost the Lancers…But there were bright spots everywhere on the gridiron in Eastern’s 2022 debut…Rayshon Andrews is legit and should have had more than the 138 yards and three touchdowns he ended up with. Over 100 yards and two TDs were wiped away from Andrews due to foolish penalties…The running attack worked with Jaiden Fore (12 rushes, 67 yards) and Kyle Babin (5-23) on the job…The running duo complimented the offense well as did QB Kamden Laprise. The sophomore sensation connected on 7-of-15 passes for 122 yards and two TDs. He needs just 101 additional yards to equal last season’s passing totals - showing how far the youngster has come in just a short time…Brady Brown (2 passes, 39 yards), Austin Shorette (1-23), Zaveyn Tate (1-15) and Kyle Babin (1-4) all shined on offense…Defensively, the Lancers played well but that darn clock just wouldn’t move fast enough over the last 17 minutes of the contest…If the Kingstreeters can limit those gaffes, Eastern has a chance in this one against Platt…“We just sputtered in the second half,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius after the RHAM loss. “[There were] really no answers for it. You’ve got to give RHAM credit. They made the plays that they had to make”…This is the first of four consecutive road games for the Lancers (I don’t know who made this schedule, but this is ridiculous).</p>
