<p>We’re already in Week Four of the scholastic football campaign and that means the Bristol Central football squad is looking to get back to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the program is a hungry bunch off a 1-2 start that included a couple losses that ended up in one-possession defeats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was that close in all three of Central’s games to date but it’s a brand new opponent tonight and a different challenge in the form of winless Enfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, Central has been able to grab some serious momentum during the middle of the campaign and the Enfield challenge is the start of three straight games for the Rams in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This could be the beginning of something very big and here’s what to expect from the Rams tonight:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enfield (0-2) at Bristol Central (1-2)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>7 p.m. (Bristol Central turf field at BCHS)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: This is the fifth showdown between the squads as the series is all tied up at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Week:&nbsp;</strong>Enfield was rocked by Brien McMahon 19-2 while Central just fell at Wilton 14-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fast Facts: </strong>Enfield has scored just eight total points this season. That’s an average of 4.0 points-per-game and the squad will be hard-pressed to beat any scholastic team in that state with that tally…The Eagles lost its only home game to Middletown on September 16 (25-6 final) played from the old Fermi High School…Last week against McMahon, the Eagles allowed the opponents 290 total yards in offense. Enfield was then suffocated offensively as McMahon compiled a half-dozen tackles for losses and four sacks. That’s 10 possessions where the Eagles’ offense was stuck in reverse…Central has the tools to keep that kind of pressure on the Eagles as well…Enfield did not win a game last season and an 0-2 start this year tells the same story…Central has gotten excellent defensive play over the first quarter in every game to date this year, allowing opponents zero first period points but in the second stanza, the Rams have been outscored 22-0. Expect those numbers to improve against undermanned Enfield…Central QB Nick Salinas has been a solid dual threat for the program, making 15-of-35 passes for 238 yards while leading the team in carries (41) for 148 yards…Salinas and Tre Blair (27 carries, team-leading 196 yards) both have three rushing TD’s to lead the team and will be unleashed for big gains over Central’s rushing schemes versus the Eagles…Aiden Lamarre leads the locals in receptions with five while Blair has four catches for 91 total yards and a score…Carmelo Thompson has an ever-improving skillset (25 carries, 71 yards; four catches, 46 yards, TD) and the contest might be a coming out party for the youngster (and the entire Central program for that matter)…Central allows just under 22 points-per-game this season and with a solid defensive effort, that average should be chopped down significantly…If Central can win this one, it could have a domino effect for the Rams’ excellent program as October commences.</p>
