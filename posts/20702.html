<p>Families, friends and neighbors gathered on the upper deck of the Page Park Pool on Thursday evening for a community tree lighting ceremony honoring the lives of Lt. Dustin Demonte and Sgt. Alex Hamzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol police officers lined the walkway to the pool, standing alongside the families of Lt. Demonte and Sgt. Hamzy. Cheers of “Bristol Strong!” echoed around the room as the tree was lit for the first time.<br>The festive sounds of carols filled the air while children were greeted by a special visitor from the North Pole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The “Night of Lights” event is the first holiday event that Bristol has held in several years due to COVID-19 precautions.</p>

<p>“I hope that they do this again next year,” said Moran. “It’s been a lot of fun.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
