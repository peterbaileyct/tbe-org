<p>NEW BRITAIN - The Bristol Central girls track and field team put together a great effort at the recent Class L championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Rams finished in 17th place - scoring 14 points - and had several athletes make big finishes over a loaded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a great turnout,” said Central coach Kiara Bonilla-Jusino. “We had both relays in the top 10.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off those performances, the Rams will have representatives at the CIAC State Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top five finishers in each event move on to the Open Championship on Monday, also from New Britain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Kylee Barnes will be competing in two of the jumping events at the Open thanks to her finish at the Class Ls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the long jump, Barnes took third place with a leap of 16 feet, 2.75 inches to punch her ticket to the biggest event in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to top that effort, Barnes nabbed a fourth place finish in the high jump - nailing the mark at five feet, two inches - to advance in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kylee just continues to just excel at the jumps,” said Bonilla-Jusino of Barnes. “Unfortunately for her, the triple jump didn’t go as planned but I think this year for her, high jump and long jump have been her best jumps by far. She’s close to the national qualifying standard [in the high jump] which is 5-3 so she kind of has that in her mind.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Central’s lone victory in terms of an individual effort on the track, Sophia Stark made a great showing, scoring a 10th place tally in the 800 meters with a time of 2:24.2 - a good finish for the Central program. "Sophia, I mean, she’s had a great season, coming from last year at a 2:32,” said Bonillia of Stark. “She ran a 2:23 against Eastern all by herself. She blew herself out of the water, so she’s set her own standard for herself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team also finished well in the short distance sprinting relays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the competitive 4x400 meter relay, the team of Stark, Gabriela Drewniak, Francesca Amara, and Lynae Lewis finished in 4:13.2 - good for seventh place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Central’s 4x100 meter relay combination of Christina Browne, Rebecca Litwinczyk, Francesca Amara, and Lewis scooped up an eighth place finish in 51.47 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My seniors, Christian and Becky, are big components of that 4x100” really as seniors said Bonilla-Jusino. “So, they’re going to be missed as far as that goes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor ended up winning the Class L title behind a 105-point performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edwin O. Smith was a distant runner-up (75 points) followed by New Canaan (71).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall of West Hartford (52 points) came in fourth place while Shelton (51) was one point behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central did well this year, taking a smaller group to the task each and every day and doing quite well over regular and postseason action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the likes of Barnes, Stark, Drewniak, Amara, and Lewis all return next season and will help lead the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A lot of those girls who qualified and performed are retuning,” said Bonilla-Jusino. “The team is young so we’re going to keep moving forward with that.”&nbsp;</p>
