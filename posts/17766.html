<p>SOUTH WINDSOR - Frankie Porrini, one of the standout cross country runners of the Central Connecticut Conference, isn’t just the heart and soul of the program over at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s the leader of the team, a model student-athlete, and has simply taken the 2022 campaign by storm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior continued his torrid pace at the 10th Harry Gerraghty Cross Country Invite on September 30, winning the race from Nevers Park in South Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini was in a battle against Glastonbury’s Harrison Krause and the duo finished 1-2 at the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central harrier won the race in 16:04.2 while Krause (16:14.2) was the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini ran an average mile time of 5:10.4 to help tally the winning mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Glastonbury’s top-five, like Central, is an excellent grouping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams finished third overall as a program, just one point behind second place Hall (61).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glastonbury won the day with a 33-point showing as the team had four racers cross the line over a top-nine showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Chris Roy was in the mix as well, placing fourth in 17:28.8 - another big finish for the outstanding senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Patrick Wininger has been moving up the ranks as of late, finishing fifth in 17:51.2 while Bristol Eastern’s Dominic Tartarelli was seventh (17:55.6 overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lancers’ standout Jack Mulcunry also had a good day, crossing the line in 18:14.6 while Central’s Lance Archibald (21st, 18:39.6) also had a solid showing on the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s trio of Nick DiMatteo (34th, 19:46.9), Scott Petrosky (42nd, 20:02.1) and Braydan Dwyer (43rd, 20:09.9) all ran well for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Lancers, Brendan Tartarelli (25th, 19:11.5), Aidan Tartarelli (28th, 19:24.8), Dylan Prince (29th, 19:25.8), Cole Beland (33rd, 19:44.5) and Aidan Gezelman (36th, 19:48.7) had good finishes at the mainly CCC event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had a great finish, placing fourth overall (98 points), one place behind Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls front, Bristol Eastern freshmen sensation Kaelyn Gonzalez did extremely well in the varsity race - finishing up in 20:45.4 for fifth place - the second-best time by a freshman that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She beat every senior's time on the course but one. Edwin O. Smith’s Briana Ashton placed third with a time of 20:34.8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Sophia Stark was 13th overall (22:13.1) as the junior ran a very good race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teammate Katie Tran (21st, 23:01.3) wasn’t far off the pace while Eastern’s Lauren Ayotte was 31st overall with a finish of 23:49.8 to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also running well for the Rams was Emma Cavallari (37th, 24:56.3) and&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lynae Lewis (40th, 26:15.9).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edwin O. Smith (19 points) won the girls race as all five of its runners placed in the top-8 in the team scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the girls JV race, Central’s Ruth Smith (29th place, 27:02.8) made the best finish of any local competitor.</p>
