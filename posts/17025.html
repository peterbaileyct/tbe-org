<p>Eastern split the first two sets, winning the first by a score of 26-24 and losing the second 25-27. The two sets were both seat-squirming affairs, as both teams had multiple chances to win.</p>

<p>The Lancers then ran off sets three and four by scores of 25-16 and 25-19. The long bus ride back to Bristol was a satisfying one, as an early-season challenge was well-met.</p>

<p>Bristol Eastern was led in victory by Alyssa Valentine, who served 2 aces and dished out 35 assists. Captain Lauren Bender was all over the court, serving up 4 aces and knocking down 20 kills. And Lilli Lowe came up big for the Lancers with 7 aces and 7 kills.</p>
