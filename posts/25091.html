<p>The campaign for the Bristol Eastern girls tennis squad started off with back-to-back matches from home, dropping both matches by identical 6-1 scores in CCC interdivisional play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On April 5, the Lancers lost to Enfield and then the following day, Eastern dropped a 6-1 decision to Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both matches commenced from the tennis courts on the campus of Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the contest against Enfield, the squad was able to sweep the action in singles play while the Eagles were winners in two of the three doubles encounters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers lone victory came in the third slot in doubles as the combination of Makayla Warnat and Isabella Davis hung a 6-2 and 7-6 loss against Charlotte Paltronien and Kayla Xiong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in doubles action, Enfield’s Olivia Eugenio and Brie Sanchez were pushed to a third set as Keelie Yorkhill and Hailey Devost refused to yield in the second spot of doubles play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping the first set 4-6, the Eastern duo wrapped up a 7-5 win to tie the match up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Enfield combo took the third set, 10-8, to snare the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the next afternoon, the Lancers fell to the Warriors but challenged the visitors throughout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Keelie Yorkhill ended up battling Kirikia Bittner-Chee Hung to a three-set challenge in the final singles slot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yorkhill nabbed a 6-2 triumph in set one, fell 2-6 in the ensuing set but won out in the end with a 10-6 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers also did well in the second singles bout, pitting Windsor’s Amanda Eneh against Eastern’s Vanessa Cyr.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another three set battle ensued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After falling behind in set one (6-2), Cyr ended up taking the second (6-3) – forcing a winner-take-all third set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eneh won the final set, 10-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Back to the grind</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had nearly two weeks off between matches but the Kingstreeters are in action over the next three days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This afternoon, Northwest Catholic comes to town and then on Thursday, East Catholic makes an appearance from the tennis courts at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally on Friday, Eastern competes in its first road challenge of the year and must burn through all its cash on gas money for a trip to Edwin O. Smith in Storrs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three contests commence at 3:45 p.m. and are CCC interdivisional matches.</p>
