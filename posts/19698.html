<p>Mary O’Neil, of Bristol, passed away peacefully surrounded by her loving children at age 88 on Tuesday, Nov. 8, which happened to be Election Day. For the past 30 years, she could be found working at various Bristol polling locations on that day. Mary Louise Mills was born in Milton, Mass. on Feb. 23, 1934, to parents Helen (Coleman) and Richard Mills, Sr. She was predeceased by her parents, her older sister Dorothy Scanlon and older brother, Richard Mills. </p>

<p>While raising her children, Mary was involved in many Bristol civic and church organizations and served for many years as President of the St. Matthew’s Guild of the Blessed Sacrament and President of the Bristol Women’s Club. She and her husband were extremely active in the Bristol Republican town committee. Employed over the years at JC Penney, Motorlease Corporation, and the O’Neil Law Firm, she retired in 1998 to spend more time with her husband and 11 grandchildren. She was a passionate supporter of her grandchildren’s sporting events, music performances, dance recitals, and school activities.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
