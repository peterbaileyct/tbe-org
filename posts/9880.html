<p>Our dear mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, Lottie (Rajewicz) Archacki, 90, of Bristol, passed from this world to her heavenly home on Tuesday, Dec. 14, to be reunited with her beloved husband, Ed and her dear son, Ed, Jr. </p>

<p>Lottie was born on Jan. 26, 1931, in Bristol and was the only child of the late Antony and Pauline (Kapecki) Rajewicz. A lifelong Bristol resident, she retired from the State of Connecticut Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. She will be remembered for her pleasant nature and kindness. She was happily involved with ministries in her parish, St. Stanislaus Church of Bristol, serving in many roles over a number of years. There will never be another quite like Lottie. </p>

<p>We have benefitted from her love and sense of humor. Learned from her wisdom and perseverance, and have admired her strength, independence, and love of life itself. Bask in the light of your eternal home Mom, Grammy, with those who have entered the kingdom of God before you. Until we meet again, we will treasure the many precious memories we were blessed to create with you. You remain forever in our hearts. </p>

The family is grateful to her caregiver, Audet Dixon, for her faithful care over the last four years enabling Lottie to continue to live in her beloved home after Ed Sr.’s passing in 2015.</p>
