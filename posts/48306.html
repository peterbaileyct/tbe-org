<p>A Bristol Police Criminal Investigation Division report resulted in the death of 2-year-old by physical abuse over a period of time, rather than a fall down a flight of stairs as originally indicated, according to a release from the Bristol Police Dept. yesterday.</p>

<p>On Jan. 1, the Bristol Police responded to a city residence for a call where they found that 2-year old child was reported to have fallen down a flight of stairs and was unresponsive. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Responding officers immediately assessed the child and performed CPR. Bristol EMS arrived on scene and transported the child to the Bristol Hospital, where the child was pronounced dead. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that time, responding officers noticed a significant amount of abnormal injuries on the child while performing CPR. The Bristol Police Criminal Investigations Division was called to the scene and began an investigation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the child did not fall down a flight of stairs but was instead the victim of physical abuse over a period of time, ultimately resulting in the death of the child.</p>
