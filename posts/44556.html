<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How was your Bellsprout Day and your spotlight hours recently? I hope you all got some awesome shiny Pokémon! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were huge changes that happened this week, and I’m sure you guys saw a bunch already. For those that don’t know, let me briefly tell you about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Registeel is making a comeback to round out this month. Registeel will be in five-star raid battles from April 25 to May 2, with a Raid Hour from 6 to 7 p.m. This dominant steel-type Pokémon is excellent for PVP, or player versus player. This one can be a shiny version as well and can be defeated with five players. To set yourselves up for success, use fire, ground or fighting types to gain victory. </p>

<p>Here are the best places to find them:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.<br>Bushnell Park, Hartford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game is also undergoing some changes as well. You may have noticed the graphics on the map when encountering a Pokémon. On top of this, the avatars were updated as well. To celebrate these changes, Pokémon Go has launched an event for Kanto that will let new and old players experience the glory of this generation that started it all. This begins May 9.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those that want to compete in the North American International Championships, today is the day to register.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season's NAIC event will take place at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, La., from June 7 to June 9. It will award high amounts of Championship Points and more than $500,000 USD in prizes, spread across the Pokémon TCG, Pokémon VGC, Pokémon GO, and Pokémon UNITE competitions.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
