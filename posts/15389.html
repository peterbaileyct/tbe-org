<p>“We’re holding adoption events throughout the summer. Kids can come pick out their own reading buddies and a book, with the promise that they’ll read to their buddies 20 minutes a day.”</p>

<p>Koser said that over 100 children visited their booth at the Farmer’s Market on July 23 to adopt a reading buddy.</p>

<p>“We had a lot of kids say that they can’t wait to go home to read, and we’re all happy about that. We want to see every single child excited about reading.”</p>

<p>In addition to the Farmer’s Market, "Making Bristol Better" volunteers can be found at the Rockin’ Out at Rockwell Summer Concert series on Tuesday evenings. The group will return to the park this Sunday to host their first “Walk &amp; Talk” event.  Parent Ambassador Jennifer St. John said that the event will provide a safe space for parents looking to connect with others.</p>
