<p>The St. Paul Falcons knocked the Naugatuck Greyhounds out of the unbeaten ranks with a 6-2 win yesterday afternoon in Naugatuck. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coby Dagata picked up his third win of the season pitching four and two-thirds innings allowing 2 runs on 5 hits while striking out five. Brian Anderson finished the game allowing no runs on no hits to pick up his first save. Starter Kevin Cestari picked up the loss for Naugatuck.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Cestari retired the St. Paul hitters in order in the top of the first, Damon Abate led off with a base hit in the bottom of the frame. Second baseman Dylan Sepulveda followed with a long, RBI double to give Naugatuck the early 1-0. Sepulveda was out trying to stretch his double into a triple, and Dagata struck out the next two batters to end the inning.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AJ Corrado led off the top of the second, and was hit by a pitch. Singles by Dagata and Mike DeRosa loaded the bases with one out. A wild pitch allowed Corrado to score, and the game was tied 1-1. A walk to Cooper Sima reloaded the bases, and a walk to Keaton Kroll gave St. Paul a 2-1 lead. Jay DeRosa followed with a 2 RBI single up the middle; then Logan Rembisk hit a sacrifice fly to right field, and St. Paul led 5-1.</p>

<p>At this point in the game, the pitchers took over and held the opposing offense in check for the next four innings. </p>

<p>The final run of the game came in the top of the seventh inning. Rembish walked leading off the frame and was replaced by pinch runner Mitch Crowley. Crowley advanced to second when Corrado was plunked for the second time, and then scored when Brian Anderson singled to left.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
