<p>PLAINVILLE – The Bristol Central softball team wants to use its games in the Central Connecticut Conference Tournament as a bit of a tune up for the upcoming Class L title chase.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the second ranked Rams, in their first round battle against No. 7 Plainville on Tuesday got a little competition – at least early in the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the end, Central star pitcher Sophia Torreso was simply overwhelming and once the Rams’ bats started churning, the game was all but over.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso scooped up a one-hit, 18 strikeout gem while the home team belted out several extra base hits as Central downed Plainville 11-0 from the softball field at BCHS.&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;victory for the Rams (20-1) while Plainville fell to 15-6 but got a good performance out of pitcher Grace Geddes (six strikeouts).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was all Torreso from the opening pitch until the final backwards K was recorded. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only hit she allowed came in the seventh inning as she fanned the side over the first four frames and added two Ks apiece in the fifth, sixth and seventh stanzas.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a good battle to start as Central went to work at the plate in the bottom of the third without the benefit of a score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had to make some adjustments,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “That was not an 11-0 game. It was a close game [with] pressure situations. I thought we missed a big hit early with a runner in scoring position [in] a couple innings that we just didn’t execute. So, we have to take advantage of those opportunities because we’re not going to get too many of those opportunities moving forward over, over and over again. So, you have to capitalize when you have those opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m glad we did that towards the middle and end of this game but moving forward, we’re going to have to get hits with people in scoring position.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils’ Natalie Newton generated a walk in the top of the first inning but never advanced – thanks in part to three strikeouts by Torreso – while Central started the bottom of the frame with zest as Kaley Laird (3-for-4, three doubles) slammed a deep dish double to the fence in left but did not come around to score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso showed Plainville very little mercy in the second stanza, fanning the side, and nabbing six Ks overall for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Geddes was dealing in the bottom of the second even after Central’s Lillian VanNostrand ((3-for-3, three RBI) opened the frame with a gapper to right.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And off a slick sacrifice bunt by Mya Porrini, Central had another runner in scoring position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Geddes remained poised, fanning the final two batters she faced, as the game was scoreless through two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso dominated in the third tilt with another three pack of Ks as the home team was about to put a dent in the scoreboard for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the third, Laird belted another two-base hit, this time to center, as the Rams had something brewing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird advanced to third off a Tori Hogan fly out to right and Torreso helped her own cause, dropping in an RBI single to left to make it a 1-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorelei Stancavage (2-for-4) then executed a triple to left, scoring Torreso, and when VanNostrand jammed a shot to center, she hustled out an RBI double as Central’s edge reached 3-0 through three.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso generated her 10th K of the game with the first out in the top of the fourth and added two more to make it a cool dozen as she was simply dealing, overwhelming Plainville hitters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s why we’re here. She’s a great ace in the hole to have,” said Hayes of Torreso. “She threw a great game, another one-hitter. She battled out there. She definitely missed a couple spots, but she came back, and I thought she executed well. She made some really good pitches tonight.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Emma Kulak dropped a one hopper to right in the fourth but was caught stealing second before Laird eventually doubled again – the third consecutive time at the plate that she launched a two-base hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While she never advanced home, the 3-0 push was more than enough entering the fifth frame as Torreso was untouchable.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She went 1-2-3 once again, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth that included 14 strikeouts and just two walks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso and Stancavage etched up back-to-back hits in the bottom of the fifth and VanNostrand made it 3-for-3 as her double to center cleared the bases, making it a 5-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini followed with a base hit up the gut – putting runners on the corners – and then a single to left to by Adrianna Lubrico made it 6-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central notched another run off an error to make it 7-0 and when Dez Nickerson raced out an infield hit to third, the bases were loaded for the top of the order.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passed ball eventually allowed Lubrico to score from third as Plainville entered the sixth stanza down eight runs (8-0).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hogan made a great diving catch of a foul ball to open the sixth and two strikeouts later, Central was back at the dish, looking to pad its lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tori diving” for that ball was tremendous, said Hayes. “She’s a special kid. And Adrianna, she can play anywhere and made a nice snag at first base [in the top of the seventh].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central added three runs in the sixth to push the cushion out to 11-0 and the only question would be if Plainville would finally be able generate its first hit in the seventh.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with one away in the last inning, Plainville’s Nora Couture hit a Texas leaguer&nbsp;to right for the only hit for the Blue Devils, but nothing came of it as Central held on to win 11-0, advancing to the semifinal round of CCC Tournament play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m just really proud of this team,” said Hayes. “I’m really proud of [Torreso] and we got to play some defense behind her, made a couple plays on some solid hit balls.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
