<p>TOLLAND - In a game the Bristol American Legion squad trailed in from the start, the squad finally finished its suspended game against the Northeast program out of Tolland on Friday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game survived two rainouts and was completed as Post 2 fell 11-3, getting swept by Northeast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s how all the events went, leading to a tough loss by Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The beginning - June 12</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast scored three times in both the first and second innings while adding another run in the third to tally that 7-0 edge through three frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jared Wilhelm and Ryan Giluly were a combined 5-of-6 from the plate that evening with an RBI and five runs scored while eventual winning pitcher Mason Wilson was 2-of-2 with a double and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hill, Mason allowed just two hits, punched out three and did not allow a walk through three completed innings as the visitors were in charge as the rain wrecked the game at Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Continuation Number 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was recommenced a couple weeks later with Bristol in the field to start the top of the fourth inning as Isaac Roberge retook the mound for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast picked up where it left off as an RBI single by Andrew McGann scored Ben Belair as the squad led 8-0 with Bristol coming up to bat in the bottom of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McGann took over on the mound for Wilson, promptly walking Bristol’s Jed Sutula to start a Bristol rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio spun out an infield hit to shortstop to put two on as, unbelievably, the rain came back!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Churchill then walked to juice the bases with the dangerous Cole Caccamo at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo grounded out to first but scored Sutula from third as the deficit was chopped to 8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not long after, the umpires called the game due to rain and – once again – the teams needed another day to attempt to finish the contest for yet a third time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Continuation Number 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though the game was played in Tolland, Bristol remained the home team this past Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the restart of the game, Bristol had two on, but Connor Cyr struck out to end the fourth as Northeast was up 8-1 going into the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Wilhelm smacked a deep double to center but no further damage was done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fifth, Post 2 loaded the bases without the benefit of an out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanchez singled up the middle while Elliot Norris and Nick Sconziano each nabbed infield hits to juice the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And an RBI fielder’s choice by Gavin Colvin scored Sanchez to trim the deficit to 8-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the sixth, Diego Mercado was robbed of an infield hit by Norris as his throw and Connor Cyr’s scoop-in led to the first out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back-to-back base hits scored Mason to increase the Northeast lead to 9-2. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passed ball made it 10-2 as Ryan Duffy scored from third and a walk to Wilhelm loaded the bases once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast generated a runoff a hit by Derek Melfor, making it an 11-2 game, but a base running mistake got Post 2 out of the inning, down nine runs in the bottom of the sixth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In that second game, we were behind the eight ball from the start,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol got one run back as Jayden Churchill nabbed an infield hit, Josh Dunne drew a walk and a fielder’s choice put the runners on first and third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And EJ Sanchez was able to score Churchill via a groundout as the deficit was cut to 11-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the seventh, Norris took over on the hill and quickly went to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two groundouts and a fly out to Churchill in center got Bristol to the dish quickly in the bottom of the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Bristol couldn’t dent the deficit any further, bowing out by an eight-run final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have our own fate in front of us,” said LaPenta. “We have two games left and we have to take care of business. Hopefully on Saturday and Sunday, we can get a couple ‘W’s.’&nbsp;</p>
