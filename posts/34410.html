<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer program put together an excellent defensive game plan against non-conference foe Portland on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it took just one ball to slip through the Lancers’ net&nbsp;to change the outcome of the showdown as the Highlanders were able to defeat the home squad by a 1-0 final from Alumni Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Portland remained undefeated at 3-0-2 while Eastern fell to 0-3-1 despite having chances of notching a game-tying goal throughout the match.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers were outshot at the goal 8-1 as attempts were few and far between for the home program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The credit belonged to Eastern keeper Hailey Beebe and a stout defensive attack that showed excellent ability in stopping shots at the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beebe stopped seven of the Highlanders’ eight attempts but the one ball that slipped through was scored midway during the first period by Cristina Austin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was all the offense the visiting aggression needed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 17 minutes remaining in the first half, a close play led to the only score of the encounter for Austin and the squad from Portland. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Austin beat a defender on the end line and snuck a nifty shot near post on Bebee for the lone goal,” said Bristol Eastern coach Scott Redman.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lillian Carroll saved the one shot Eastern attempted on the Portland goal that afternoon as the keeper is undefeated on the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers held the Highlanders scoreless the rest of the way - for nearly 57 minutes - but the team never scored over a tough 1-0 decision.</p>

<p><strong>Not Private but [Hartford] Public</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Hartford Public invaded the campus of Bristol Eastern in a CCC Interdivisional clash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs were looking for their first win of the season but Eastern was the team that came away with the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Owls (0-3) allowed 6.3 goals-per-game to start the campaign and allowed just about the same against Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were 6-0 winners - moving to 1-3-1 after five matches.&nbsp;</p>
