BURLINGTON - It wasn’t that long ago when the Bristol Eastern softball team
was a couple games under .500 with a cluster of contests to be played over a
short period of time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

But if the Lancers could win all of those games, the Kingstreeters could
turn everything around.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

And that’s exactly what’s happened to Eastern over the last week or so,
picking up its fifth consecutive victory via a 17-1 thrashing of Lewis Mills
from a CCC South bout in Burlington on Monday afternoon.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

After a bit of a slump, seeing the squad fall to 5-7 overall, it’s been
nothing but improvement since for the Lancers.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Eastern has won five straight and the entire line-up contributed to the
cause over the Spartans.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Leading the charge for the Kingstreeters was Grace D’Amato as she scooped up
four RBI two lead the offense.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Also for the Lancers, Makayla Antunes, Gracie Browne, and Ashley Serafin all
tallied two hits apiece.

Ali Tellier also had a great day on the mound over the winning effort,
scooping up nine strikeouts

<strong>Back to work</strong>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

There’s absolutely no rest for the weary as Eastern is back in action on
Tuesday against Manchester.

The CCC Interdivisional bout commences at 3:45 p.m. on King Street.
