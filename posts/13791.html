<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is with great sorrow we share the passing of Dave Parker. He passed peacefully with his loving family by his side on Sunday, May 22. He was a lifelong resident of Bristol and was well known by many. His vibrant smile would light up a room and make everyone comfortable. He was full of life with a huge heart. He would give you the shirt of his back and help you any way he could. He would also be the first to rise up and protect anyone that needed his help.</p>
