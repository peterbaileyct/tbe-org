<p>STORRS -- Missed opportunities foiled the Bristol Eastern football team on Friday night as the program dropped a tough 24-14 decision to Edwin O. Smith in a CCC Tier III tilt from Storrs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss dropped the program to 5-3 overall while the Panthers improved to that very same mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tough night for Bristol special teams as the unit dropped punt, allowed a touchdown on a kickoff return and a critical penalty on a missed field goal by the Panthers stopped the Lancers in their tracks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Unfortunately, it’s a major part of the game,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius of the special team miscues. “We didn’t make enough plays in that phase tonight.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was a complete mess, for both teams, due to penalty, after penalty, after penalty -- leading to a combined 220 penalty yards and, over the first 14 minutes of the showdown, 10 penalties were called as officials handed out yellow flags like people gave out candy to trick-or-treaters on Halloween just last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there were very few treats in this back-and-forth affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had chances to win this one thanks to a tremendous second-half defensive effort as the Panthers were allowed just one late score in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that touchdown gambit essentially ended the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown started off well as Eastern marched 67 yards off 10 plays on its first drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back Jaiden Fore, BE’s newest 1,000-yard rusher, made a one-yard gallop into the end zone and with 5:50 left to play in the first period, it was a 7-0 game thanks to Aiden Liseo’s PAT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Smith responded with a five-play series as E.O. quarterback Connor Ouellette found Justin Beaton for a slick 30-yard TD strike -- tying things up at 7-7 at the 3:18 mark of the first period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the game truly became bizarre after that scoring drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Eastern’s ensuing possession, receiver Mikey Sherrill could not haul in a pass from quarterback Kamden Laprise (9-for-19, 110 yards) and the official nearest the play immediately signaled no catch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as the ball was dropped, it was picked up by a Panthers’ defender who started to run with the football.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The play was ruled day but after a brief discussion by the officials -- that truly wasn’t so brief -- the call was overturned and ruled a fumble, giving the home team the ball despite protests from Julius and his staff.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four plays later, Smith was stuck on Eastern’s 42-yard line as the defense forced a punt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the punted ball was not cleanly caught on a fair catch and the Panthers got it back, retaining possession and earning a fresh set of downs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drive went into the second stanza and thanks to a huge tackle for a loss by Ryan Zavecz and Lincoln Bashaw, Smith was forced to kick a 28-yard field goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A false start sent the team back five yards and on the 33-yard retry, which completely missed its mark, the sideline official called Eastern for an encroachment penalty despite the line not moving and Smith got the ball back to the 28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, the kick was good as Smith moved ahead in the showdown 10-7 with 11:06 to go in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We forced a missed field goal, but we had a procedural pre-snap penalty that gave them another chance at it,” said Julius. “These things hurt in game against a quality opponent.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams then exchanged punts but midway through the second period, Eastern started a drive from Smith’s 46 due to a personal foul.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the drive, Laprise found Noah Albert (four catches, 47 yards) for a big 17-yard connection and then it was all Fore from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fore made six straight rushes to get Eastern in the red zone and finally, he hopped into the goal, literally, via an eight-yard dash - and with 2:13 to go in the first half, Eastern retook the lead at 14-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They were able to capitalize on a huge return and, I thought, we kind of taken the momentum back, scoring late there in the first half to go up 14-10, said Julius.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Smith, a program that has played most of its games from behind this year, saw Sam DeJesus rip off a 79-yard kickoff return as the Panthers retook the lead at 17-14 with 1:58.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“E.O. was missing a lot of players early on in the season,” said Julius. “They kind of stubbed their toes early but they’re a quality football team. They’re very physical. They’re well coached.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smith took that three-point lead into the locker room but was not able to immediately add to it thanks to Eastern’s stout defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hunter Wells had a huge tackle for a loss on Smith’s first series out of the break while the defense held on again over the next drive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Eastern fumble with 1:51 to play in the third gave Smith the ball back -- going all the way to the Eastern seven before being stopped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two penalties pushed Smith back to the 17 and an Ouellette pass was picked off in the end zone by Eastern’s Bryce Bacote as the 14-10 score lasted deep into the final period.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The defense kept giving us the ball back,” said Julius. “Then they kind of sputtered out on a play or two. It would put us behind the sticks and get us off schedule. That hurt us a little bit tonight [and] we weren’t able to recover.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an Eastern punt, Smith stalled out on Eastern’s 41 and with 5:27 to play, the visiting aggression was looking for the game-winning score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fore made a 15-yard jaunt on the ensuing drive and the squad got to the Smith 40 before turning the ball over with 2:17 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, the Panthers pushed across one final score as a game-changing 50-yard rush by Isaiah DeJesus got the squad into the red zone and the ball carrier ended the series with a six-yard TD sprint up the middle for an insurance score - making it 24-14 with 1:43 to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern couldn’t return the favor in the end as Smith hung on to win the showdown by 10 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Unfortunately, we didn’t do enough to win tonight,” said Julius. “It’s really what it comes down to. There are still multiple games left to be played. We can still finish our season on a high note but we kind of have to dig in here a little bit, get some things corrected and kind of go from there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Adam Zavecz, getting his usual quota of tackles, made two receptions for 34 yards…Eastern wrangled up 219 total yards in offense while E.O. tallied 247.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
