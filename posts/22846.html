<p>BURLINGTON –&nbsp;The Bristol Central girls basketball team continued its winning ways on Tuesday night as the squad paid a trip to Burlington to square off against Lewis Mills in a CCC South engagement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notching its fifth straight victory, the Rams knocked off the Spartans by a 41-30 final from the Thunder Dome on the campus of Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central improved to 14-4 overall on the campaign and are having their best season in over 20 years under head coach Steve Gaudet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can split their final two games, it would leave the program at 15-5 which would match the team’s best record since 1999-00.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 1999 program was under the guidance of then coach Ginny Torreso, winning a couple postseason games along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a bit of an uphill battle against Mills at first as the game was all knotted up at 17-17 heading into the halftime break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams used an 18-10 third quarter surge to salt away the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Arianna Rivera led all players with 19 points while Brooke Watson cashed in nine – hitting the only 3 for the team that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slick shooting Leilani Jackson-Mills posted six points while ever-improving center Nicole Riemer notched four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans did not have a double-figure scorer as Abriana Wroblewski led her squad with nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central outscored Mills 11-9 to open first period play but could not sustain the small edge by the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans held the Rams to just six second period points as the 17-17 score was the halftime tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central then went for 18 third-period points to secure a 35-27 edge after three completed frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the Rams allowed just three points the rest of the way as Central nabbed a big 41-30 road victory for its 14<sup>th</sup> triumph of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two more games</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central battles against Berlin on Friday in Bristol and its final regular season game of the season commences next Monday when rival Bristol Eastern travels to the campus of BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both CCC South showdowns begin at 6:45 from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams last two losses were to non-conference opponents as Gaudet said he wanted his squad to see some non-CCC competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Loss</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There haven’t been many losses this season by the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central fell to North Haven (57-30) back on January 21 while one week previous, the Rams lost at Sheehan (63-39).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those programs have winning records this year while Central’s other two setbacks against South Windsor (42-39) and Middletown (55-51) were by a combined seven points.</p>
