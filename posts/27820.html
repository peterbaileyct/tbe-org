<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - When the Northeast and Bristol American Legion baseball teams attempted to square off on June 12 from Muzzy Field in a Zone 3 tilt, Mother Nature had a say in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After nearly an hour of play, the rain came crashing down at 6:43 p.m. - causing a delay that soon forced a postponement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That contest saw Northeast ramp up a 7-0 edge through three completed frames with the continuation taking place on Sunday afternoon after Post 2 had picked off Zone 3 leading Ellington by a 3-1 final in the previous game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or would the contest against Northeast be postponed once again due to spotty downpours in Bristol?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, the unofficial doubleheader commenced with Northeast ahead by seven runs off 10 hits - looking to add a few more runs to the board in the top of the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, how did the game get to 7-0 in the first place?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick summary:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>June 12 Rewind</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast scored three times in both the first and second innings while adding another run in the third to tally that 7-0 edge through three frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jared Wilhelm and Ryan Giluly were a combined 5-of-6 from the plate that evening with an RBI and five runs scored while Mason Wilson was 2-of-2 with a double and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hill, Mason allowed just two hits, punched out three and did not allow a walk through three completed innings as the visitors were in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The game continues nearly two weeks later…sort of</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was recommenced at 3:23 p.m. on Sunday with Bristol in the field to start the top of the fourth inning as Isaac Roberge retook the mound for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Northeast picked up where it left off as an RBI single by Andrew McGann scored Ben Belair as the squad led 8-0 with Bristol coming up to bat in the bottom of the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McGann took over on the mound for Wilson, promptly walking Bristol’s Jed Sutula to start a Bristol rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio spun out an infield hit to shortstop to put two on as, unbelievably, the rain came back!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Jayden Churchill walked, the bases were juiced with the dangerous Cole Caccamo at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caccamo grounded out to first but scored Sutula from third as the deficit was chopped to 8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon after, the umpires called the game due to rain and - once again - Northeast had to return to Muzzy Field another day to finish the contest for yet a third time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weather baffles the Bristol coach</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta has led both the Bristol American senior and junior programs over several summers, dealing with all kinds of weather phenomenon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The suspension of the Northeast game was the third contest that has been suspended this season because of rain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s not even July yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, postponements foiled two games twice this week alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Torrington game on Monday, stuck at 3-1 in the fourth inning, was rained out in the fourth and the Northeast contest from Sunday have both been postponed over a six-day period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Has LaPenta ever seen this kind of bizarre weather, leading to multiple stoppages and postponements?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” said LaPenta bluntly. “No and this week coming up, it could be worse.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With games almost every day over the final week of June, and rain prevalent in the forecast, something might have to give schedule wise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 originally had a couple games set up at the 2023 Stars and Stripes Tournament on Saturday, July 8 and Sunday, July 9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps those contests might have to go by the wayside to get in one or two suspended Zone 3 contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were supposed to play [on] Patriot Weekend in Danbury,” said LaPenta. “We may have to back those [out] to play our regular zone games because if this week gets washed out, there’s a lot of games backed up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was scheduled to take on Danbury on July 8 and then the following day, it was a date against Ridgefield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both games were to commence from Danbury High school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, those showdowns are in jeopardy depending on the weather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A possible continuation against Northeast could take place on July 14 when Bristol travels to Tolland for a Zone 3 encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That date might turn into a doubleheader of sorts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
