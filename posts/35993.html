<p>BRISTOL - After absorbing a tough seven-goal loss at Maloney last Monday, the Bristol Eastern girls soccer team hung around in its CCC South bout against Middletown on Thursday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons (7-5-2 overall) were flummoxed by the Lancers (3-9-1) the entire evening and only scored when Eastern coach Scott Redman advanced most of his players forward in order to tally a game-winning goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, a late goal from Middletown allowed the visitors to square up a 1-0 victory from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A&nbsp;very evenly matched contest [against] Middletown resulted in a 1-0 defeat and elimination from postseason play,” said Redman. “I would argue the Lancers outplayed Middletown and created more high-quality chances but were unable to convert.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams combined to shoot 10 total times at the&nbsp;opponents’ nets but Eastern never gave up until time expired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, after 77 scoreless minutes, the Blue Dragons finally tallied a goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown’s Gabrielle Butler redirected a cross into the side of the Eastern netting, just inside the far post, for the game winning score.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was] a beautiful finish,” said Redman of the goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Eastern had shots at the net, Middletown ended up stopping every attempt the squad took at the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the final horn sounded, Butler’s ball was the only goal of the game as Eastern fell 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We needed a win to maintain a chance&nbsp;to qualify for the tourney, so we pressed forward, and it opened up space for them,” said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown outshot Eastern 6-4 while earning five corner kicks along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maya Martin made four stops for Middletown while Eastern keeper Hailey Beebe added five saves.</p>
