<p>With a crisis raging in Ukraine and an eye towards current events, this Thursday, at 7 p.m., the Bristol Historical Society presents Damien Cregeau, an independent historian from Connecticut, and his special presentation, Ukraine: Then and Now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr. Cregeau will examine 150 years of the history between Ukraine and Russia, beginning with the definition of Europe and central versus eastern Europe and ending with a brief analysis of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The areas of discussion will also include the Russian takeover of Ukraine in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century by Catherine the Great, the Crimean War in the 1850s, the famine of the 1930s, World War II, and Vladimir Putin’s career, including his many war crimes over the past twenty years both home and abroad.</p>

All proceeds will be donated to CARE’s Ukraine Crisis Fund, which provides aid to those affected by the war, including food, water, hygiene kits, support services, and direct cash assistance.
