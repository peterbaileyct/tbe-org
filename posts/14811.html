<p>MERIDEN – Just about a month ago, Bristol Senior American Legion pitcher/outfielder Dylan Woodsome banged up his troublesome shoulder in Post 2’s 11-7 triumph on the road in Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he eventually got back to the dugout, somehow popped his shoulder back in and a couple games later, Woodsome was back at it again and in the starting lineup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He hurt his shoulder years ago in a Bristol Eastern/Bristol Central JV boys basketball game and even after his shoulder was ‘fixed’ and he was cleared to resume play again, it was still trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he’s the definition of a gamer and a little sore shoulder couldn’t slow down the likable ‘Woody’ in the least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just this past Sunday, Woodsome had a banner day against Meriden - helping Bristol to a 10-7 victory in extra innings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After throwing thirty pitches of scoreless ball, he then zipped out the game-winning hit in the ninth - eventually propelling Post 2 to the three-run victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’ll do whatever you ask of him,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Woodsome. “It was just awesome.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can start a game on the hill in a pinch, isn’t a bad right fielder, and can get you a hit or two every once in a grand while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>‘I know’</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second game of the Bristol/Meriden doubleheader, Bristol’s Michael Roalf took over in centerfield for Ryan Fradette while Woodsome was playing in right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Post 45’s first at-bat of the seventh inning, the ball was hit in Woodsome’s direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf, attempting to help out his teammate, started to yell ‘back, back, back, back, back…’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome screamed back <em>‘I know’</em> as he made the catch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those two weren’t exactly trying to recreate the epic Han Solo/Princess Leia moment from the movie <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was some great banter back and forth between the duo for the rest of the inning as Bristol closed out the game - winning 7-2 - to sweep the day over Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That exchange had the Bristol fans chuckling as it was a classic moment over a long season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woodsome is a model player, a very good teammate, and does a little of everything for the American Legion baseball program over his final season of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the postseason arrives for Post 2 this weekend, Woodsome is going to bring a little veteran presence and experience which should help Bristol win at least a couple of games.</p>
