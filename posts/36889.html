<p>The public school girls and boys soccer programs are representing the city of Bristol to the best of their abilities this postseason and that means close matches and exciting games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls soccer team from Central had its hands full against Wethersfield on Monday afternoon while both boys soccer programs at BC and BE look to hit the pitch running on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what happened on Monday and what to expect come Tuesday afternoon:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls Soccer - Central hangs with CCC foe until the end</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L - First Round: No. 14 Wethersfield 2, No. 19 Bristol Central 1</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Rams, after a slow start to the campaign, rallied to an 8-8 overall record and earned the 19th seed in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was an all CCC battle in first round action as No 14 Wethersfield handed the Rams a tough one goal loss from Cottone Field on the campus of Wethersfield High school on Monday evening, 2-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles (9-4-4 overall) advanced to second round play against No. 3 Brookfield - a squad that earned a bye off a stellar 13-3 regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit belongs to the Central program after a tough 0-5 ledger to begin the season, finishing the campaign with an 8-4 burst - including a sweep of Bristol Eastern by a combined score of 11-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason match marked the final game for Central seniors Kaylynn LaPointe, Sophia Dallipi and Abigail Hansen (the squad hasn’t been Hansen-less in quite some time…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams will be returning a very good squad next year with captain Francesca Amara once again leading the charge offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys soccer on Tuesday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*In Class L, first round action, the program from Bristol Eastern -- ranked 20th overall -- takes its best shot again No. 13 Masuk from Monroe on Tuesday at 4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masuk (10-4-2 overall) better be ready because the Lancers have several crafty scorers that could cause mega problems for the home team and its defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eddie Ansah, Liam Sanchez-Barreto, Rocco Barbino and Lucas Tylicki will lead the offensive charge while big Rio Fernandez helps to patrol the backline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s slick keeper Peyton Cummings who will give the Lancers everything he has in the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters have been undefeated since their bout against East Hartford, falling by a 1-0 final back on Oct. 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since that setback, Eastern is 2-0-4 and would like nothing better than to keep that amazing streak alive off a tremendous 8-4-4 regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s pay window time in Monroe on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class LL - Bristol Central tackles one of Connecticut’s best programs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams punched their postseason ticket after drawing a tie against Bristol Eastern in its second city series bout on Oct. 26 as the 31st ranked program travels to Greenwich for a first round confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cardinals are seeded as the No. 2 program in the Class LL bracket as the contest against the Rams commences from Greenwich High School at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harry Ross will be taking on all comers in the goal for Central while Greenwich needs to be wary of senior Frank Palma and junior Rafael Antonio pulling the team forward upfront.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central earned its postseason trip via a 6-9-1 overall record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cardinals went 11-2-2 in the regular season play, losing to just Staples and Darien -- coming over a stretch of eight days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victor of the showdown battles the winner of No. 15 Shelton and No. 18 Danbury on Friday afternoon.</p>
