<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball squad might be challenged off the bat this season as the program graduated three of its top four scores and needed to replace three starters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have shown the ability to rise above adversity over the years but must face this season without the services of All-Stater Ciara Collins who currently is one of the leading scorers on the women’s basketball team at Pace despite being a first year player at the collegiate level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has some shooters in the mix, a couple freshmen ready to immediately contribute and it will be up to the likes of senior Taigan Parent to help lead this crew back to the playoff picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC is not an easy division to play in, the Kingstreeters will have to travel far and wide this season and snaring around eight wins to make the state tournament should be in the cards once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a quick peak at the girls basketball program at Bristol Eastern:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN GIRLS BASKETBALL</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Tony Floyd (43rd season)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong>: 8-13 overall in 2022 (No. 21 Bristol Eastern lost in the first round to No. 12 Bethel, 46-45 over a heartbreaker).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 42 seasons at Eastern, Floyd is 594-336 overall. Floyd won state titles in 1983, 1987 and in back-to-back seasons of 1990-1991.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Ciara Collins (guard/forward/center), Janessa Gonzalez (forward), Emma Stavens (guard/forward).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Taigan Parent (sr, guard), Vanessa Drury (jr, guard), Emily Piendak (sr, forward), Lauren Ayotte (jr, forward), Leah Roy (so, guard/forward), Amanda Noel (so, forward), Tavia Swain (so, guard), Grace Browne (so, guard), Hailey Beebe (so, guard), Gabriella Piendak (so, guard/forward), Autumn Udoh (fr, forward), Jayle Evins-Mosley (fr, forward).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Experienced guards, good size off bench&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Depth, varsity experience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Eastern will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;Eastern has an experienced coaching staff who has been there and done that. Floyd and company have the tools to get the players in the right position to be as successful as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Relevant Fact:&nbsp;</strong>The Lancers once again will challenge several of the top squads that the CCC has to offer but why do the Lancers have to travel all over the CCC globe this winter? Thank you Mr. Greenleaf (Triple G: Gas Guzzling Greenleaf). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Another&nbsp;Relevant&nbsp;Fact:&nbsp;</strong>After going 7-13 in 1994-95, Eastern has earned a spot in the postseason every year since.&nbsp;The 2022-23 campaign shouldn’t be any different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: After losing All-State talent Ciara Collins and tough forward Janessa Gonzalez, it would seem this could be a tough season for the Lancers and that monster of a schedule is of no help thanks to Eastern’s winning ways over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this is also a group that, if it can gel as a unit, could surprise opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Eastern is going to be a bit on the youthful side this season, those youngsters are talented and there’s a core group that came back to the fold which should keep Eastern afloat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We really just have two starters coming back,” said Floyd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading the crew will be senior Taigan Parent, a nifty guard that’s been in the line-up since her freshman campaign. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent, Eastern’s third leading scorer last season at 6.8 points-per-game, was also fifth on the squad in rebounding (3.0 per), third in assists (2.5) while scooping in a steal per game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her three-point shooting has improved leaps and bounds and is an 80-plus percent shooter from the charity stripe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent’s leadership, drive and abilities overall will be important to the success of this squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow senior, forward Emily Piendak, started 10 games for the program last season and did a quality job on the rebounding front.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will need a little more offense out of her but if she can sink a couple hoops along the way, the Lancers will be all the better for it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s a couple returners from the junior class eager to improve upon their games from last season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury is a slick shooter who started turning the corner last year right around midseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She played in 20 games, starting 17, contributing three points and a couple rebounds every game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury isn’t afraid to shoot the ball and she’ll give the offense a little pep over the campaign while assisting on the playmaking front&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forward Lauren Ayotte started five of her 18 games last season and nearly contributed four rebounds an outing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She did a credible job boxing out, averaged a slick 1.9 offensive rebounds-per-game and is another leader the program can turn to.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what sophomores are going to make a step up for the Lancers this season?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guard Leah Roy proved to be a defensive pest last year and will provide some scoring and tough rebounding while forward Amanda Noel should be able to nab a few rebounds along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple freshman will also contribute this season as forwards Autumn Udoh and Jayle Evins-Mosley could factor into the mix – bringing some badly needed size, scoring and defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh is tailor made for Eastern’s transition game and could be Eastern’s leading rebounder by season’s end while Evins-Mosley is going to be tough to stop in the paint. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is going to have some challenges this season but if the squad can get out into transition, play a little defense and drop the ball into the hoop more often than not, the team is going to win some games along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch this season</strong>: The Kingstreeters certainly have their hands full this season with another loaded schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern opens up its home slate on Friday against Middletown (6 p.m.) and then on December 29, St. Joseph comes to town for a non-conference tilt at 5 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers first week of January sees Berlin (January 2), New Britain (January 4) and Northwest Catholic (January 6) invade the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium. All those showdowns will be tough tests.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern tangle for the first time on January 16 while the Lancers make a trip to Career Magnet in New Haven on Saturday, January 21.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are home for three games in February and on 13<sup>th</sup> of that month, it’s Part II between the Lancers and Rams.&nbsp;</p>
