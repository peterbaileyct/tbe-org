<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team continued its extended home stand against Avon Tuesday night. The result was a close game where every goal and literally every second counted. Avon held on for an 11-8 triumph over the Lancers in a game that Eastern was in to the final horn.</p>

<p>Avon took a 2-1 lead after the first quarter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In the second quarter both teams traded goals and Eastern seemed to have a one goal deficit going into the half after a free shot goal by Emma Stavens with 10 seconds in the quarter.&nbsp; However Avon won possession and ran down the field to score as time expired for a 5-3 lead. There was some discussion about whether the goal should count as the ball has to enter the goal before the horn but it appeared the Avon player released the ball but it didn't clear in time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the 3rd quarter it was a 7-6 Avon lead as time wound down and Avon yet again scored a last second goal to go up 8-6 entering the 4th.</p>
