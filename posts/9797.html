<p>Bristol Central was well represented on the CCC South All-Conference Boys Soccer team, with 4 selections: Beckett Hennessey, Ethan Crumrine, Mark Palma, and Carson Rivoira. These boys led Central to an 11-3-2 regular season record, one of the best seasons in the history of Bristol Central soccer.</p>

<p>Ethan Crumrine – Center midfielder. He was the team’s primary corner kick taker and free kick taker in the offensive zone. Had an excellent touch on his kicks and had an excellent connection with Carson Rivoira. Ethan had 2 goals and 11 assists. 10 of his assists were to Rivoira. They were a lethal combination, due in large part to the quality and consistency of Crumrine’s kicks. He worked tirelessly in the midfield and helped control the midfield and the game with his level-headed play and dogged determination. </p>

<p>Beckett Hennessey – Central Defender. Beckett was the backbone of the defense for the past two seasons, and was Mr. Reliable each and every game this season. Beckett was the quarterback of the defense, constantly communicating with all defenders and midfielders to keep the BC defense in the right positions. When Beckett was in a one-on-one situation, the vast majority of the times it was a win for BC.  The defense was very solid all season, often limiting teams to very few shots, and Beckett was the anchor of the stingy defense. <br></p>

<p>Mark Palma – Center Midfielder. Mark had 7 goals and 9 assists on the season. He was the engine behind the offensive machine that this year’s team was. Mark was relentless for 80 minutes, played the entire width of the field and was dogged in his pursuit of the ball. His excellent footwork enabled him to get out of many double and triple teams into the open field and then start the attack. He had assists to all parts of the field and had many great and timely goals on the season. </p>

<p>Carson Rivoira – Striker. Rivoira led the offense with 19 goals and 8 assists. He shined in the two games against Bristol Eastern, with 3 goals and 1 assist. He was the team’s finisher, very skilled and strong up front. Defenders struggled with his size and strength, as well as his dominance in the air. He scored many highlight reel goals in the air rising above the defenders who struggled to mark him. Many of Rivoira’s goals came off of corner kicks and free kicks, mostly from Crumrine.</p>

<p>In addition to being outstanding soccer players, the players selected were the four captains of the soccer team, as well as being on the All-Academic team each year on the varsity. <br></p>
