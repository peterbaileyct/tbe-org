<p>Jeffery Joseph Doyon, 67, of Bristol, passed away on Friday, Sept. 6. Born in Bristol on April 26, 1957, to the late Yvon and Josephine (Morrone) Doyon, Jeff was known for his quick wit, generous heart, and the pride he took in his family and work.</p>

<p>Jeff spent over 30 years caring for Bristol’s public spaces and ran a successful landscaping business, leaving a lasting impact on the city he loved. His strong work ethic and dedication were evident in everything he did, always putting others before himself.</p>

<p>He was a devoted husband to the late Karen (Snow) Doyon, sharing many years of love and laughter. Jeff’s infectious smile and generosity left a lasting impact on everyone he met—whether at the Hidden Havana Cigar Club, with his work crew, or along his daily travels.</p>

<p>Jeff had a deep love for music, a lifelong passion for soccer, and an unwavering devotion to the Yankees. Above all, he cherished time spent with his family and friends; his greatest fulfillment came from the relationships he built and the care he showed to those around him.</p>

<p>He is survived by his daughters, Nicole Gesner and her husband Kevin, and Cassie Doyon, both of Bristol; his granddaughter, Ava Gesner; his sister, Jodie DeCrisantis and her husband T.J. of Florida; his brother, Gary Doyon of Bristol; and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his son, Ryan Doyon, as well as his parents and wife, Karen.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
