<p>SOUTHINGTON – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball squad has a tough CCC Interdivisional schedule to tangle with this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it seems like that’s the case every single year due to the Lancers’ winning ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in its second road contest of the campaign, Eastern traveled to Southington to battle winless Southington on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Southington was able to stuff Eastern’s offensive efforts, outside of the play from senior Taigan Parent, as the Knights earned a 52-28 victory at Southington High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington is now 1-2 overall while Eastern fell to 1-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were never able to heat up from the field but Parent stuffed home a season-high 16 points to lead the offensive charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent hit four three-pointers as her long range game has taken off this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh nabbed five points, Vanessa Drury added four while Amanda Noel canned three free throws for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lily Cooper led the effort for Southington as she scored a team-high 12 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights etched up an 11-2 advantage through eight minutes of play and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored just seven points in the second stanza, trailing 32-9 at intermission, and through three completed frames, Southington was in complete control at 41-15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is back in action on Thursday as the squad travels to the Thunderdome at Lewis Mills High School in Burlington to battle the Spartans (1-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is slated for 6 p.m.</p>
