<p>After Sunday morning’s heavy rains produced flooding in several areas of Bristol, Gov. Ned Lamont came to town in the afternoon to inspect the damage done at the intersection of Middle Street and Memorial Boulevard.</p>

<p>Repair crews were already hard at work replacing parts of the road that buckled and needed repair when the governor arrived.</p>

<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano described the situation the city faced at approximately 8 a.m. when the downpour began. Several drivers attempted to drive through flooded areas of town and ended up stalled and stranded in rising waters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor stressed that drivers should not think they can drive through a flooded street, and instead should turn around and avoid the possibility of needing to be extricated from their vehicles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four different emergency situations had to be dealt with as drivers were stranded in their stalled cars and needed to be rescued. In one case, the water had risen so high that the driver had to be pulled out through the car window.</p>

<p>The governor was traveling across Connecticut Sunday afternoon inspecting the state’s hardest hit areas. He stated that it was more important than ever that the state be prepared for extreme weather events that are happening much more frequently.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
