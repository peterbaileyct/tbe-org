<p>BRISTOL - Santa Claus made a quick stop-off in Bristol on Saturday morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Santa, in fact, was at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church on Camp Street from 8-11 a.m. for a very worthy cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for a little yummy breakfast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was in town to support the fundraising efforts of the Sons of the American Legion Squadron 209 - raising money for a new monument that will be constructed on Memorial Boulevard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Santa Claus is here…for the Sons of the American Legion’s Squadron 209 Pancake Breakfast,” said Brian Avery on the Post 209 Forestville Facebook Page. “Your donation is going towards the POW/MIA monument.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeff Caggiano was also on hand for this special event, eating delicious pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage and other breakfast delights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other guests who enjoyed the event included recent Bristol Sports Hall of Fame inductee Frank Owsianko, Jr. and his brother Mike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children got to see Santa waving from Camp Street when entering the parking lot at Gloria Dei and later on, the jolly one met and greeted every child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pictures were taken, there were plenty of smiles and every child was able to take home a present from Santa Claus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the event, which cost just $10 per person, was a special one held during the Christmas season of giving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“100% of the profits from this benefit will go to the POW/MIA Monument being built on [Memorial] Boulevard for Memorial Day 2024,” said the release on Facebook.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cost of the memorial is $14,000 and even after Santa’s visit, donations are still being taken by the Bristol Veterans Council.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
