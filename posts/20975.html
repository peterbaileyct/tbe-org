<p>MANCHESTER - Apparently, basketball played from the gymnasium at Manchester High School seems to be the launching point of some very talented scholastic players from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in this example, both the careers of former Bristol Central All-State standout and current UConn center Donovan Clingan and Bristol Eastern freshman Autumn Udoh started off scholastically with showdowns in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, both teams had completely different results against the Red Hawks over their first respective games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Central and Clingan on December 14, 2018, the Rams ran into a talented Manchester squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The then Indians were big 86-43 victors but Clingan showed everyone just what his game on the hardwood would become.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot-10 center zipped up team-highs of 14 points, 16 rebounds and rejected six shots over a tremendous debut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central led 8-2 early but was outscored 84-35 the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, Central went 8-13 overall but was still able to fight its way into the playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following season, Central lost just five games, was ranked fourth in the Division II playoff field but the pandemic knocked out the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forty-three consecutive wins later, Clingan was headed off to the University of Connecticut with a CIAC Division II state title in hand off a simply remarkable scholastic career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>While Clingan lost his first encounter, Udoh hit the pay window over her debut game.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Udoh - whose sister Jade Udoh was a 1,000-point scorer at St. Paul Catholic - led her squad to a win from Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind Udoh’s sensational effort, Eastern hit the pay window for the first time in 2022, sinking the Red Hawks 51-39 in a CCC Interdivisional tilt back on December 13.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh came off the bench with 1:36 gone in the first quarter as teammate Lauren Ayotte committed two quick fouls - leading to the debut by the 5-foot-11 forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She came in firing and was tremendous on the defensive end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Udoh drained 6-of-14 shots, going a perfect 3-for-3 from the free throw line, for a team best 15 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight of her 18 total rebounds came off the offensive glass while she also tallied an assist, rejected four shots and snared four steals over an amazing first game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan finished one of the greatest individual scholastic campaigns in state history with a 28-0 record as a senior in 2022, a CIAC Division II champion, and is a top-10 career scorer in Connecticut state history.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will happen over Udoh’s four year career from Bristol Eastern?</p>

<p>Keep your eyes on Udoh as her game unfolds for the Lancers.</p>
