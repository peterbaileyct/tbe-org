<p>BRISTOL – It’s already time for a little city series clash as the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern girls basketball teams are ready to hit the court on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the Rams swept the series over two close showdowns and fast forward to this year, most of those same participants will be involved in the rematch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have won four out of its past five contests going into the Mum City tilt while the Rams recently broke a three game losing streak with a 67-25 triumph over Platt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it will be interesting to see how much Eastern decides to run, trap and press as the visitors hope to get into transition early and often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday evening as Eastern travels to Bristol Central: &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern Girls Basketball at Bristol Central, CCC South Tilt&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When</strong>: Tuesday, 6:45 p.m. (weather permitting)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The storyline to consider</strong>: Eastern has been tremendous this year, rolling out a 9-2 record and will be looking for victory number 10. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern head coach Tony Floyd is pleasantly surprised about how his young core has gotten up to speed in a hurry – making big contributions to the program right off the bat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have been playing well and have a good shot to win another game on the road, this time against the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern (9-2 overall) – Head Coach</strong>: Tony Floyd&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>:&nbsp;Autumn Udoh (sophomore), forward/center; Vanessa Drury (senior), guard; Lauren Ayotte (senior), forward; Leah Roy (junior), guard/forward; Amanda Noel (junior), forward; Cassie Sward (freshmen), guard; Savannah Drury (freshmen), guard; Natalie Vye (freshmen), guard; Alaina Joy (freshmen), guard/forward.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Does Eastern have the edge in this main event bout</strong>? You know the deal with records when it comes down to city series play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throw all those records out the window and simply sit back and enjoy the hardwood warfare.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has been rolling this season, losing its two games by a combined 12 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe there is something to that amazing ledger after all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have been very good this season, blending its upperclassmen with a multi-talented sophomore along with a stellar freshmen class.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of that sophomore, Autumn Udoh has picked up where she left off in 2022-23, leading the program in several statistical categories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through 11 games this year, the forward is averaging team highs of 17.5 points, 12.5 rebounds and 4.3 blocked shots-per-game. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Letendre</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if Udoh gets beaten to the hoop, which isn’t often, she has the ability to block shots from behind and also averages three steals a night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She doesn’t take a ton of 3-pointers but Udoh does connect from long range on occasion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forward Amanda Noel (8.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.3 blocks-per-game) is easily the most improved player on the squad – capable of a double-double on any given night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She can block shots, runs the floor with zest, finishes at the hoop and snares a few balls away in the passing lanes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add in veteran forward Lauren Ayotte (2.3 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.2 steals-per-game), a blue collar athlete that does so many good things on the court, helping out the younger players along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, the forwards on the squad are tough to top.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point guard Vanessa Drury (9.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 3.1 assists-per-game) has also been there and done that - in her third season of varsity action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She does a little of everything on the court, shoots with range and when her shot isn’t falling, Drury is doing something else that helps the program win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like the contest at Maloney this past Friday when she netted just two points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury dished out 10 assists and nabbed five steals, spinning the Spartans in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Maloney, junior Leah Roy made her debut in Meriden and she filled up the stat sheet with all kinds of tremendous numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy’s return was a big boon for the squad as she immediately returned to the starting unit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Roy was on the sidelines, preparing to make her comeback, the freshmen duo of &nbsp;Cassie Sward (6.2 points, 1.7 steals-per-game) and Savannah Drury (4.8 points-per-game) made a combined 10 starts – getting plenty of experience under the bright lights of varsity basketball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Freshmen Alaina Joy and Natalia Vye will also provide support when called upon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is certainly talented and if the nerves don’t get in the way at Central on Tuesday, the Kingstreeters have a good chance in this one.&nbsp;</p>
