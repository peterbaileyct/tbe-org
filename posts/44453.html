<p>The co-captain battery of Logan Rembish and Cal Chance led the St. Paul Falcons to a 12-0 win over the Seymour Wildcats in Seymour last evening at French Park. </p>

<p>Rembish was dominant on the mound striking out 12 while scattering four hits and allowing no walks. Chance led the offense going two for four with a grand slam in the fifth inning. Starter Conor Recine took the loss for Seymour, his first loss of the season.</p>

<p>St. Paul took an early 1-0 lead in the top of the first. With two outs, Coby Dagata singled. Then AJ Corrado hit a long double driving in Dagata with the first run of the game.</p>

<p>In the top of the second, Seth Meuer led off with a double. After a walk to Keaton Kroll, Jay DeRosa hit an RBI single driving in Meuer. Singles by Chance and Dagata, some aggressive baserunning, and a wild pitch allowed St. Paul to score 3 more and open up a 5-0 lead.</p>

<p>Rembish led off the top of the third with a single. Rembish stole second, and came in to score on Kroll's RBI double. Kroll scored later on a throwing error, and St. Paul led 7-0 after three innings.</p>

<p>In the top of the fifth, Meuer led off with an infield single. Walks to Kroll and DeRosa loaded the bases. Then Brian Anderson picked up an RBI beating out an infield hit. That ended the day on the mound for Conor Recine and he was replaced by reliever Ryan Babineau. Chance greeted Babineau with a high fly ball over the right center field fence; a grand slam that cleared the bases and made it 12-0. And that was the final score.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
