<p>The postseason started for one of our public-school volleyball programs on Monday evening with another match commencing for the other outstanding teams on Tuesday in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern squads are in the mix -- looking to make some loud noises over state tournament play in 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of all of Monday’s action from the volleyball scene as Bristol Eastern advanced in tournament play while Bristol Central’s first round match is on tap for Tuesday at 6 p.m. in town:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Volleyball - Bristol Eastern passes first Class L Test</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Class L - First Round: No. 10 Bristol Eastern 3, No. 23 Waterbury Career Academy 0</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Kingstreeters are in a familiar place, ranked among the top-10 in a loaded field of quality Class L programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And step one was accomplished on Monday evening as the tenth ranked Lancers foiled No. 23 Waterbury Career Academy in straight sets during a first round tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game scores were 25-11, 25-21 and 25-15 in a match from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the stars came out to shine in this one for Eastern, led by the frontline duo of Adrianna Reay and Gabby Caucci.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay blasted WCA for 18 kills, six digs and four aces while Caucci knocked the Naugatuck Valley League program for 14 kills, 11 digs and slipped in an ace to complete a tremendous effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setter Naseem Hennouch notched 39 assists and three digs as the setter was here, there and everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other contributions came from Kamila Mateo Rivera (two kills, two aces, three digs), Samara Paranzino (two kills) and Jamayrie McRae (one kill).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the victory, the squad advances to square off against the winner of No, 7 Stratford and No. 26 Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Eagles can pull off an upset, the squad will travel to Bristol for a second-round showdown on Thursday at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central hits the court on Tuesday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The 2023 Class L runner-up starts its journey on Tuesday, welcoming No. 24 New Milford to town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium at Bristol Central High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This squad is fresh off a second place showing in the CCC Tournament and is locked in for another long tournament jaunt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ trio of captains, Alex Rivera, Grace Higgins and Lily Kirk, will be leading the charge against a solid Green Wave program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Milford went 10-11 overall coming into the contest at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the first contest for the Green Wave against a CCC opponent this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of the event squares off against the victor of No. 8 Guilford and No. 25 Bethel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bethel can flip the script and seize an upset win, the program will be heading to the Mum City on Thursday at 6 p.m.</p>
