<p>The scholastic football decade of the 2010’s started off with the program from Bristol Eastern winning several times on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But about halfway through the decade, Bristol Central had a reversal of fortunes against its crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters won three of the five games by single digits but by 2015, it was all Central in terms of victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the last three games were decided by 13 points and the Rams needed overtime to seize the last battle in 2019.</p>

<p>Here’s the latest chapter of Central/Eastern Thanksgiving Day football rivalry as the 2021 contest is on the horizon:</p>
