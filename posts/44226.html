<p>April is Poetry Month, so TBE is including links to poems for those who might be inclined to start their day with an adventure of sorts or who are simply curious. There will be links to classics as well as to some sources that are new. Some will hit home, others will miss.</p>

<p>For those with a few minutes, there is the&nbsp;<a href="https://onbeing.org/series/poetry-unbound/">Poetry Unbound</a>&nbsp;website hosted by Pádraig Ó Tuama, an Irish poet. He provides commentary along with each poem.</p>

<p>And there are everyday people, who talk about a particular poem that means something special to them. Try Robert Pinsky's "Favorite Poem Project." Click <a href="https://www.favoritepoem.org/poems/the-emigrant-irish/">here</a> for an example, featuring Eavan Boland's "The Emigrant Irish," with reading and comments by Stephen Murphy, who has a background in finance and lives in Boston.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
