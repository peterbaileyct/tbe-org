<p>The softball squads from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern got to the pay window on Monday afternoon over two double-figure victories, defeating programs from the Silver City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams easily beat Maloney by a 14-2 final while the Lancers dropped Platt over a 11-1 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at all the softball action from Monday:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central 14, Maloney 2: </strong>On the hill for Central, Alex Sciarretto picked up the win, not allowing the Spartans much in terms of offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pitching sensation racked up 12 strikeouts over the Rams’ 12-run triumph in CCC South play from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the dish, the combination of Lorelei Stancavage and Sophia Torreso tallied four total hits to pace the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo each went 2-for-4, scoring two runs apiece, while also collecting three RBI each over the winning endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, just about everyone had a hand in moving Central to 6-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 14 runs were the second most the Rams have scored in a single game this season, save the 16 notched against Pomperaug last week, as the program won for the sixth straight time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We broke it open in the fourth, aided by five errors&nbsp;from Maloney,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “Sam Sklenka, Gabby&nbsp;Buonafede and Mya Porrini scored multiple&nbsp;runs each for the Rams.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of teams from Meriden, Central travels to the Silver City on Wednesday for a CCC South bout at Platt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 3:45 p.m.<strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern 11, Platt 1:</strong>&nbsp;Pitching and defense ruled the day for the Kingstreeters against Platt, spinning the squad by 10 runs in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 5-3 on the season in the contest played from the Thunderdome on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South contest saw the combination of Ali Tellier and Ashley Serafin limit the Panthers to just the one run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Valentine had the hit of the day, cracking out a grand slam, as Eastern has been on a record pace for home runs this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Sam Policki smoked out a double while Jazmyn Browne wrangled up two hits for the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gracie Brown brought a little defense to the field, making five putouts on the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooklyn Cividanes drilled a homer for Platt, now 4-6 at the halfway mark of the season, while Ariana Soto smacked out an extra-base hit as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Hart drew the loss for the Spartans but had two hits at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up next, Eastern squares off against Maloney on the road Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. from the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden.</p>
