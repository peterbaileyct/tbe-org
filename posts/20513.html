<p>On Saturday, November 5, the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League honored its Hall of Fame class of 2022 from the Indian Hill Country Club in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that ceremony included a local talent from Berlin that was a huge contributor to the Bristol Merchants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GHTBL Hall of Fame Committee inducted eleven new members and Jay Maule was part of that group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 2007-11, Maule was a big contributor to the Bristol Merchant’s championship program, guided by coach and manager Bunty Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maule was part of several regular season title teams as the Merchants won the regular season championships in 2007, 2009 and 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And over the 2007 and 2009 campaigns, Bristol also won the GHTBL Playoff Championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maule was a speedster on the base paths, chasing down everything in the outfield, and usually found himself batting leadoff for the Merchants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2007, Bristol went 26-6 overall as Maule ended up leading the league in batting average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That season, he was also named GHTBL Player of the Year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One year later, Maule was named to the GHTBL All-Star Team - batting .345 overall, good for ninth in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up third in the GHTBL in steals with nine while in 2009, when the Merchants won both the regular and postseason championships, Maule earned the Ralph Giansanti award as he led the league in steals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in 2010, Bristol went 25-5 overall and Maule had another tremendous campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lefty batted a slick .372 over 14 games that included two home runs and 11 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied a .437 on-base percentage, slugged the ball at a .605 clip and also helped his squad once again over postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maule was a stud for the baseball programs at both Berlin High School and Central Connecticut State University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, he was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 23rd round of the 1999 Major League Draft.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played five seasons of minor league baseball with both the Astros and New York Yankees franchises which included a stint in the Eastern League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maule played at the Double A level in Trenton back in 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He batted .274 in 42 games with 32 hits, 13 RBI and 20 runs scored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then four short years later, he found his way to the Bristol Merchants, one of many former minor league players to suit up for the local program.</p>
