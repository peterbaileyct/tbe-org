<p>Kim Caron will be running for the City Council's First District alongside Democratic running-mate Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller, it was announced in a release from the Democratic Town Committee last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron said she is running for City Council because she believes the role of local administration is to be responsive to the needs of the residents and businesses in the city, according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron recently completed a fellowship at the University of Connecticut's Encore! Program and is currently employed as an executive administrator for New Opportunities, Inc., a large community action agency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron, a Bristol native, has served as vice chair of the city's Freedom of Information (FOI) Advisory Board since 2018. She has also served as the executive vice president of the Central Connecticut Paralegal Association. </p>

<p>She has spent the last three decades working in the finance, legal and public utility sectors for a large, local defense contractor, as well as large corporations and banks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If endorsed on July 25 by the Democratic Town Committee, Caron and Rasmullen-Tuller will be on the Democratic line of this year's municipal election ballot. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They would be challenging Republicans Sebastian Panioto, a first-term incumbent, and Erick Rosengren, who was appointed by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano when Jolene Luistani, who was in her first term, resigned from the council. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
