<p>BRISTOL -- In the first game of a twin bill against Torrington, the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team turned to its ace chucker, Roberto Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the pitcher ended up throwing a complete game as Post 2 wrangled up a 6-2 victory in a Zone 1 affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz moved to 3-0 overall, allowing six hits while striking out four, working himself out of a couple jams to remain perfect on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He gutted through,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Cruz. “I thought the umpire, his zone wasn’t giving [Cruz] the low strike at all. But I give the umpire credit because he stayed the whole game like that. He was tight, he was only giving the high strike and I give him credit for staying with that zone because really, as a player or coach, all you want it a consistent zone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third straight victory for Bristol (4-2 Zone 1) after a week off from competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington (1-6 overall) could have put a real hurting on Bristol in the first frame as Josh Hamel (2-for-4, double) and Tyler Semonich (2-for-3, run) smoked out back-to-back hits while Joe Dipippo drew a full count with nobody out - threatening to load the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s when the fun truly began.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dipippo struck out and when Hamel was caught in between second and third base on the K, Post 2 tracked the man down, tagging him out in what turned into a not-your-usual 2-6-5-4 double play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Steele Brobston fell via strikes, the half-inning came to a close without the benefit of a score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 had a response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris (2-for-3, three runs, RBI) started the inning with a walk and off a botched pickoff attempt, with the ball rolling all the way to the first base fence, the runner was off to the races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris easily tagged second base and sprinted to third, nearly sliding over the bag on a quick tag, but was called safe despite a protest from the Torrington skipper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Caron brought Norris home on a groundout to shortstop as Bristol led it 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Ryan Fradette launched a bloop pop-up to short center that three fielders watched drop in safely, leaving second base open in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette then sprinted to second, beating the fielder to the bag for a slick double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then stole third and scored on a flare to right by Tyler Stickles -- making it 2-0 through just one inning. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 nearly put together a two-out rally in the second when Chris Osuch walked and Norris singled to left -- putting two on -- but nothing came of it as the home team maintained its two-run edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Cruz retired eight straight, Semonich chopped a base hit into left field and went to second on a wild pitch to open the fourth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone, Steele Brobston grounded out to Cruz on the hill, throwing the ball to first for the second out and on the play, Semonich went to third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The throw to third went above Caron’s head as Semonich scooted home, chopping the deficit to 2-1.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dillon Hudson and Tyler Martin each got plunked by pitches to open the bottom of the fourth and Matt Beaucar sacrificed the duo a base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Osuch was hit by a pitch, the bases were loaded with one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Small ball was then on tap as Norris dropped in a picture-perfect bunt, right in front of the pitcher who didn’t have a play on the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We executed really well with Elliot bunting,” said LaPenta of Norris. “And he eventually stole home.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hudson came home to score and when Jayden Churchill (1-for-2, two RBI) drew a bases loaded walk, Martin scored as Bristol led it, 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Bristol went for a double steal with Fradette at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the count at 1-2, Norris stole home -- beating the tag -- as Post 2 started the fifth stanza with a 5-1 cushion in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz had retired 12 of 13 batters when he allowed his first walk of the game, a one-out base-on-balls to Hank Martin in the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He didn’t have his breaking ball but, once again, he battled through the whole game,” said LaPenta of Cruz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fielder’s choice by Nick Basso erased the lead runner with two outs but he stole second and scored on a single by Ben Smith off a misplayed ball as Post 38 chopped the deficit to 5-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamel followed with a two-base hit to the gap in left and with runners on second and third, Torrington had the tying runner at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Semonich flew out to Beaucar in right to end the threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamel retired the Bristol side in the bottom of the fifth as Post 38 was still trailing by three runs as the sixth inning commenced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cruz allowed a one-out base hit by Brobston in the sixth, but no damage was done, while on the flip side, Mike Roalf earned a walk to open the bottom portion of the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Churchill ended Hamel’s day on the hill as the batter absolutely scorched a double down the line in left - easily scoring Norris who reached on a fielder’s choice and stole second -- as Post 2 scooped up a 6-2 cushion through six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington drew two walks in the seventh but the team was down to its final two outs, trailing by four runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the showdown, Hamel struck out and Smith was picked off at first base by Cruz to end things as Bristol won the first portion of the doubleheader by a 6-2 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‘We got the pickoff at first base to end the game,” said LaPenta. “That game, fundamentally, we did a lot of good things.”</p>
