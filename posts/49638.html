<p>The latest Chippanee Country Club weekly news email contains an item dispelling rumors that the club is selling to a developer who would be building condominiums on the property. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There is a rumor going around that the club is sold or has been sold to a developer looking to build homes on the property," the announcement reads, appearing under the title, "Rumor control..." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The rumor is NOT TRUE!!! We would not have invested in sprinkler systems, car paths, and all the other infrastructure improvements if the club were up for sale!!!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The announcement, in the Aug. 13 newsletter, concludes with an appeal to those who are contributing to the rumors to, please, stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If you are part of the rumor mill, please stop as this could hurt our efforts to attract new members, outside events and weddings."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
