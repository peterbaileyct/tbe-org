<p>Dear social media people for the mayor,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the love of God, stop recording the mayor vertically. It looks like amateur hour. And while you are at it, get the man a microphone. His voice competes with background noises, and he can’t effectively be heard.</p>

<p>You can pick up a wireless Lavalier mic for 30 bucks on Amazon. Sheesh.</p>

<p>Fifty-four years ago, yesterday, a hobbled Willis Reed limped out onto the court before Game 7 of the NBA finals, putting Madison Square Garden into a frenzy. Reed inspired his Knickerbockers to victory and their first NBA title.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
