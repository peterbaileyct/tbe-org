<p>BURLINGTON – It didn’t take long for the Bristol Eastern boys track and field team to get to .500 this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after battling some of the heavyweights of the CCC South, the Lancers have been able to cobble together wins against Maloney and on a rainy Tuesday afternoon, Lewis Mills was Eastern’s latest conquest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans fell to the Lancers by an 80-70 final from Burlington, pushing its ledger to 2-2 on the campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lewis Mills fell to 2-1-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters won all three relay events with the likes of Jack Mulcunry and Carter Harris winning multiple races.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4×800 relay, the combination of Logan Crowley, Dominik Tartarelli, Mulcunry, and Harris won the challenge in 8:32 while in the 4x400, Mulcunry, Edward Ansah, Preston Poirier, and Harris were the victors in 3:46.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the speedy 4×100 relay event, the combination of Preston Poirier, Dylan Bradley, Dante Marciano, and Maurice Chisholm took first place in 47.8 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Poirier, the speedster won the one hundred meters in 11.9 seconds and in the 800, Harris took the heat with a sterling time of 2:05 to win it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris also won the pole vault with a successful completion of nine feet, six inches. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the field for the Lancers, sophomore stud Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum was the winner of both the long and triple jump challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawrence-Bynum won the long with a jump of 16 feet, eight inches and in the triple, the athlete took the event with a leap of 38 feet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern stays in Bristol for the remainder of the regular season as the month of May sees the Lancers competing exclusively from its home base of Alumni Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First up for the Kingstreeters is a CCC South encounter against Middletown next Tuesday at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
