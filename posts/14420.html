<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the Connecticut American Legion Baseball Top-10 poll was recently released for the Seniors level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not surprisingly, the top three teams from last week are in the same positions in the most recent poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Records in the poll are as of Sunday, June 26.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RCP Prep (Cromwell) has been on a tear to start the 2022 campaign and are a perfect 12-0, ranked first among the squads in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown has been tremendous as well, rated second at 10-0, and have yet to lose while third ranked Stamford is 9-1 through 10 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Haven is a perfect 8-0 and jumped up from fifth to fourth while Zone 1’s West Hartford continues its onslaught with a 9-0 ledger – moving from eighth to the fifth slot in the most recent rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In sixth is Waterford (8-1-1), moving up one position from last week while Greenwich and Willimantic are new to the poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greenwich (7-1) is seventh, Willimantic (9-2) is eighth while the last two spots in the poll belonged to squads that fell drastically in the rankings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danbury (7-3) dropped from fourth to ninth while Ellington (7-3) slipped from sixth to 10th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>North Haven and Westport fell out of the rankings entirely but are threats within their respective zones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Tough year for Zone 1 Teams</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After losing Naugatuck to start the season, Newington – which had a solid roster of players – never got its campaign off the ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And unfortunately, the squad was unable to compete as Zone 1 has, incredibly, dropped to just five teams in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The current teams are West Hartford (9-0 Zone 1), Bristol (5-2), Simsbury (3-5), Meriden (2-6), and Torrington (1-7) who recently just got its Senior program back together after a couple years without a team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there will be a major shake-up of the zones in 2023 as Connecticut will be realigning things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Big one on Tuesday for Post 2</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has a huge game against West Hartford on Tuesday from Conard high school (5:45 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the second contest of the season between the programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 dropped a tough 5-0 decision to West Hartford on June 13, but the locals are looking to square the series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was three-hit that evening while Matt Beaucar pitched well but drew the loss in 5.2 innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The venue has changed for West Hartford as the usual battles against Bristol typically take place from Hall High School down the road a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Welcome Latko</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern’s Cole Latko was a late addition to the Bristol roster this year and will provide depth as a back-up infielder at second base and shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s also listed as a DH on the Post 2 roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko will bring a little pop to the batting order and should be a solid contributor when given a little playing time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Schedule</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Thursday, Bristol is back in action against Simsbury at 5:30 p.m. from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Post 2 is off until July 5 when the program is back on the road – in Simsbury – for a Zone 1 confrontation at Memorial Field in Simsbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown starts a stretch of five consecutive road games for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
