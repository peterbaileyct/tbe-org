<p>BRISTOL - After a scoreless stalemate at the half, the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team allowed Hall of West Hartford three second period goals as the Lancers fell by two scores in the end, 3-1, in a CCC Interdivisional showdown from Alumni Field in Bristol on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors and UCONN commit Lucas Almeida (two goals) played a strong second-forty to snare the victory after the Lancers gave Hall plenty of fits early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the win, Hall remained undefeated at 2-0-1 overall while the Kingstreeters fell to 1-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a scoreless first half, Almeida scored three minutes into the second period, making it a 1-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that edge did not last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers evened the score one minute later as Connor Policarpio fed Eddie Ansah the ball and the drive was on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah ended up chipping the ball over Hall keeper Tyler Fairchild as Eastern knotted the score at 1-1 with a ton of time left on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall’s Sam Sandler notched the game winner with 14:00 to play and Almeida added an insurance score with ten minutes remaining as the Lancers absorbed a tough 3-1 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We played smart and hard,” said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. “Hall had a little too much fire power at the end.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fairchild made four saves for the visiting aggression while Eastern goalies Peyton Cummings (seven saves) and Carlos Portillo (three) etched up a total of 10 saves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up next, Eastern hosts Farmington on Monday night at 6 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The River Hawks enter the Eastern showdown undefeated at 2-0-1 having just hung a loss on Bristol Central (3-0) on Friday in Bristol.</p>
