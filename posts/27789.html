<p>The story of Bristol Central’s Track and Field dynamic duo of Frankie Porrini and Tre Blair could lead to several volumes if someone decided to publish them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And last weekend at the 2023 New Balance Outdoor Nationals from Franklin Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (June 15-18), the senior representatives from BCHS added another chapter to their tremendous tales.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo had its coaching staff with them in their corner to witness them achieving at the highest level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini was looking to reestablish the Connecticut state record in the 2k steeplechase while Blair wanted to out-jump the competition in the challenging triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both athletes were tremendous in the ‘City of Brotherly Love’ over one of the nation’s marque events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini did indeed break the old 2k state record but another runner from Connecticut did the same over a slick top-six finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had an amazing weekend at the New Balance Outdoor Nationals,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Frankie Porrini is All-American again in the 2k steeplechase! He placed sixth with a time of 5:53.81. That time broke the existing state record. Another Connecticut runner placed third, so he ends up with the state record. But Frankie went into the race with the goal to repeat as All-American and run sub 6:00. It was a grueling race, but Frankie ran with heart and guts to reach his goals. Our entire BC community is so proud of him.”</p>

<p>Porrini also placed 15th in the Rising Stars Mile with a time of 4:19.40.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That time ended up being Porrini’s personal record in the true mile.<br>And in the field, Blair ended the triple jump - placing 19th overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His long jump of 45 feet, 1.75 inches was a great finish while also doing well in the long jump event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair placed 22nd overall with a jump of 21 feet, two inches - ending his scholastic career as one as the program’s most decorated student athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tre made history this season,” said Stafford-Kirk of Blair. “His triple jump school record of 46-11 broke the existing record by over 2 feet! That is literally mind blowing. He is leaving an outstanding legacy and has raised the bar at Bristol Central.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before he headed off to play football over at Western New England University, Blair won yet another award.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair was named the CHSCA 2023 Outdoor Track and Field male Field Athlete of the Year, putting a little icing on the cake of a tremendous scholastic career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini will continue to run at the collegiate level, taking his talents to Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven and should be a primetime performer at the NCAA Division II level.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Both Tre and Frankie leave our program as the most decorated athletes in their events,” said Stafford-Kirk. “It is bittersweet to know they won’t be with me any longer, but I am so proud of all they’ve accomplished. They have such bright futures ahead of them and I know they will continue to make me proud.”&nbsp;</p>
