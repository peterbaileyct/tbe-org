<p>Joseph proudly enlisted to serve in the United States Navy during the Korean War, traveling the world aboard the USS Gatling (DD-671). He eventually settled in Bristol in 1962, where he and his wife Henrietta raised their family. His military background and attention to detail led him to work for Pratt and Whitney from 1958 until retiring in 1996.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Joseph was an extraordinarily kind and gentle man, known for his infectious smile and witty one-liners. He was always happiest spending time with family and friends, enjoying the simple pleasures of life. When he wasn't barbequing to country western music, or hustling his grandchildren at cards, he could be found enjoying many hobbies. He loved 10-pin bowling, exploring outdoors, traveling, enjoying live music and dancing with his wife and playing horseshoes. </p>

<p>As his faith remained a pillar throughout his life, he was a parishioner of Saint Matthew Church, Bristol. He was also a member of the Southington YMCA. </p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, the family expresses an eternal debt of gratitude to Heinrich "Henry" Hermann for the compassionate care and friendship extended to Joseph throughout his commendable battle with Lewy Body dementia. Not only did the special bond shared make an immeasurable impact on Joseph, but also provided tremendous comfort to his family.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
