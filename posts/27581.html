<p>The New Balance Nationals Outdoor Track and Field Championships commenced in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania over this past weekend from the University of Pennsylvania’s Franklin Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, once again, it was a major event with student-athletes from both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams brought down senior stars Tre Blair and Frankie Porrini, competing in different events, while the Lancers had their 800 sprint medley relay crew competing as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair, in fact, competed in both the long and triple jump events, Porrini was looking to establish a new Connecticut record in the 2000 meter Steeplechase while the crew from King Street was in the thick of the 800 meter medley showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one of those athletes from Bristol also put together an excellent showing in the 800 meters as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did the group fare in the city of Brotherly Love?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The results were certainly impressive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Porrini tops his own Steeplechase time</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that amazing Top-5 finish at the Nike Outdoor Nationals last year, the All-American was in the thick of it again as Porrini was attempting to break the state’s record at the event before heading off to Southern Connecticut State University in the fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Porrini did just that, finishing the challenge in 5:56.81 which was good enough to top the old Connecticut record of 5:58.55.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Newtown’s Soheib Dissa came in third place overall (5:51.34) to just top Porrini’s excellent finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stud from Central came in sixth place overall off a tremendous finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Francis Porrini III has done it again [at the] 2023 New Balance Nationals,” said Central boys coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “[He took] sixth place and smoking school record time of 5:56.81. What a ride this guy has taken us on. I couldn’t be prouder.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern medley team finishes in the Top-15</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several months ago, Eastern saw its boys 800 meter sprint medley team punch its ticket to the Nationals and from the event in Philadelphia, the squad had a really good showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Dennis Cruz, Justin Sanchez, Rayshon Andrews and Jack Mulcunry earned 14<sup>th</sup> place over a very loaded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their combined time of 1:34.08 was a great way to finish the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Mulcunry crushed it in the Rising Stars 800 meter showcase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior finished up in 10<sup>th</sup> place, garnering a time of 1:54.80 – not far off the winning time of Matt Schutzbank from the Nyack Track Club (1:52.31).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ superstar ran 400 times of 57.50 and 57:31 seconds to make that amazing finish in Philly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Blair jumps here, there and everywhere</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior from Central did very well in both the long and triple jump events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the triple jump, Blair reached 45 feet, 1.75 inches for 18<sup>th</sup> place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Treshawn Blair finishes his triple jump season [in] 18<sup>th</sup> [place] at the New Balance Nationals,” said Stafford-Kirk. “What a season this young man had. We are so very proud of you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the long jump, the senior nabbed a leap of 21 feet, two inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That mark ended his day in 21<sup>st</sup> place over an excellent day for Blair..</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Blair earns CHSCA honors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After such an amazing track and field season – and before heading off to college to play a little football at Western New England University – the athlete earned yet another award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair was named the CHSCA 2023 Outdoor T&amp;F male Field Athlete of the Year and will be recognized this week for that outstanding achievement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll be honored at the All-State banquet this coming Wednesday at the Aqua Turf in Southington.</p>
