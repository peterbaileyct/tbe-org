<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How topsy-turvy was the scholastic volleyball campaign for the public schools in town?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the programs at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern played a tough slate of Central Connecticut Conference games, took part of the grueling CCC Tournament and then squared off against all the top squads in Class L postseason competition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams and Lancers, along with St. Joseph and eventually state champion Farmington, made for a very good block of Class L semifinalists that played well over postseason competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Lance Pepper and Eastern mentor Stefanie Reay both did a tremendous job in 2023&nbsp;- posting wins against several tough programs along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central wins another CCC South title </strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central completed an incredible two year run as back-to-back CCC South champions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going 19-9 overall, the Rams were able to knock off Eastern in its own gymnasium – an extremely rare feat – while splitting the season series with the Lancers 1-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team went to the finals of the CCC Tournament for the first time ever while falling to a talented St. Joseph squad in the semifinal round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Setter Alex Rivera, along with fellow CCC South, All-Conference mates Lily Kirk, Grace Higgins and libero Daigelis Figueroa, led another historic charge into the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivera ended her career with 2,163 assists and helped her squad get within two sets of another Class L title tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was one heck of a campaign for the Rams, playing all of their home games from the Pepperdome (Charles C .Marsh Gymnasium).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern follows suit</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a tough loss to Simsbury in the CCC Tournament, the Lancers made a run in the Class Ls – getting within an eyelash of the championship title bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern lost to eventual champion Farmington (3-0) but the program had tremendous success over its first three matches in the postseason.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program knocked off second ranked Waterford three games to one and made it to the semifinals in Class L for the second time in three seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Kingstreeters went 15-9, winning nine of their first 10 postseason sets.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had three players take home postseason honors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naseem Hennouch, Gabby Caucci and Adrianna Reay were all named to the CCC South All Conference squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay, the senior outside hitter, was tremendous from the start of the season until the last set was completed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She blasted the competition for 433 kills, an average of 5.5 per set, and competed like a Class L All-Stater the entire campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who would BE Principal Higgins cheer for if Bristol Eastern squared off against Bristol Central in the finals?</strong> <br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first time in Bristol scholastic history, the two volleyball programs had a chance to qualify for the Class L championship round which would have made it all Bristol affair.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was a situation that didn’t come to pass but would have been incredible to witness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, and this was brought up here several times along the way, who would Bristol Eastern Principal Mike Higgins cheered for during that BC/BE encounter?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember, it wouldn’t have been business as usual over that BC/BE encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would have been Central and Eastern in the finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, All-Conference stud Grace Higgins, Mike’s daughter, plays for Central while Mr. Higgins has BEHS loyalty as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During regular season battles between Central and Eastern, there’s no one squirming more than Principal Higgins along the sidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know Mike’s bother, Kevin Higgins, would have cheered for his niece but we don’t truly know what school the principal’s allegiances would be with that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s something to consider, Mr. Higgins:&nbsp;back in the day, pirates made traitors walk the plank…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gail Ericson is Bristol Volleyball</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone knows who Gail Ericson is and what she means to Bristol volleyball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, she is Bristol volleyball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just on her Mum City resume, Ericson played scholastically at Eastern and eventually came back to coach the program in 1982.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 23 years, Ericson won 332 matches, took home 15 league titles and won three state championships - the final coming in her final season (2005).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She been inducted in several hall of fames and is one of the leading forces behind the Bristol’s Crush Volleyball program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ericson was even on the Bristol Central bench on October 29, 2020 when Pepper and his staff had to isolate due to COVID.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pepper was coaching from a TV (you can’t make that stuff up) and Ericson was leading the charge from the Central bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central led 2-1 in the match before losing 3-2 in what could have been the Rams’ first win over Eastern since 1995 with Ericson at the helm for the other team!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an incredible scene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, she’s back in yet another capacity as Ericson was one of the officials at the final BC/BE clash on October 23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams defeated the Lancers 3-0 from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium and it was an extreme pleasure to see Ericson once again working her magic on the sidelines from the campus at BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
