<p>Of the 37,826 eligible voters in the city, 9,137, or 20 percent chose to vote during Early Voting.</p>

<p>"About the same amount that voted by absentee in 2016 voted that way again this year," said administrator of elections Jennifier Brunoli. She added that it's difficult to compare that to 2020 because of COVID.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than the candidates on the ballot, the only other item votes need to be aware of is the question about voting for or against no-excuse absentee ballots, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Anyone looking for a ride to the polls, may call either (860)302-3664 or (860)503-4441 to request one.</p>

<p>In addition, each polling place has an assisted voting machine that allows for hearing and sight impaired to use audio or touch screen to vote, Brunoli said.</p>
