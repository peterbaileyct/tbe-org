<p>MERIDEN – The Bristol Central boys track and field program is on a collision course for another CCC South Championship, now a perfect 4-0 after spinning Maloney by a 109-41 final from Meriden on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams took first place in all but four events as the local program is a complete juggernaut, steamrolling&nbsp;through&nbsp;every team they’ve faced to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s victories came in the 4x100 meter relay and the short distance sprints (100, 200, and 400) but other than that, it was a near wipeout by the program from Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central smoked the competition in two of the three relays as the combination of&nbsp;Rowan&nbsp;Hennessy, Patrick Wininger, Aiden Georgakopoulos, and Julieen Lopez&nbsp;took the 4x400 meter relay in 3:41.<br>And in the always challenging 4x800 meter relay, the Rams won the bout in nine minutes flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team of Chris Roy, Wininger, Aiden Georgakopoulos, and Lopez&nbsp;crossed the finish line in first place over that grueling relay challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger also grabbed victories in both the 800 meters and one mile showdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He took first place in the 800 with a finish of 2:08 while in the 1600, he ended up winning in 4:39 - an excellent mile time for any athlete.<br>Of course, senior standout Frankie Porrini was in the lineup and winning once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He took the 3200 meters in 10:03 while teammate Logan Jackson won both hurdle challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson ended up winning the 100 in 17:41 seconds and won the 300 with a finish of 44.3 seconds.<br>Central was extremely busy in the field as well with several impressive hurls, jumps and leaps for first place tallies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Paulino won the long jump with a leap of 20 feet and in the triple jump, he won with a make of 41 feet, six inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tre Blair seized first place in the high jump, getting over the bar at five feet, six inches while Jude Browning won the pole vault – clearing 10 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio of Tashawn Cauley, Aengus Repeta and Wyatt Gibson finished the meet strongly in the field.<br>Cauley took the shot put (36 feet, three inches), Repeta won the discus (114 feet, two inches) and Gibson seized victory in the javelin (118 feet, 10&nbsp;inches).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next week, Central returns home for a CCC South engagement against Plainville.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The meet against the Blue Devils commences at 3:45 p.m. and should be a competitive affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
