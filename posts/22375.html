<p>Fans of the 1960s TV show “The Monkees” will remember the catchy song played over the Season 2 end credits. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In this generation, in this lovin' time, in this generation, we will make the world shine.</em><em>&nbsp;</em>The song “For Pete’s Sake” was penned by Monkees’ bassist Peter Tork, whose words perfectly encapsulated the social atmosphere of the late 1960s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born Peter Thorkelson and raised in Willimantic, Conn., he began playing piano at age 9. After graduating from E.O. Smith High School, Tork moved to New York City, where he became part of the Greenwich Village folk scene. While playing at local coffee houses, Tork met members of the Lovin’ Spoonful, Mamas and Papas and Buffalo Springfield guitarist Stephen Stills.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the summer of 1965, Stills was one of 500 men who auditioned for the Monkees TV show. While the producers were interested in him, Stills wasn’t the right fit for the band. Before departing his second audition, Stills recommended his friend Peter Tork to the producers, who was cast in the show.</p>

<p>Tork recorded five albums with The Monkees, as well as the soundtrack for their 1968 film <em>Head.</em> In addition to providing song lyrics, bass and vocals, Tork played many instruments on the recordings, including guitar, banjo, keyboard and piano. Tork was the first member to leave the Monkees, departing in December 1968. The band officially broke up 18 months later in 1970. </p>

<p>The Monkees reunited as a band in 1986 for a 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary reunion tour, which sold out almost every venue. Following the success of the tour, the Monkees recorded <em>Pool It!,</em> the first album of new Monkees material in 17 years. The band recorded three subsequent albums together, including <em>Christmas Party</em>, which would be Tork’s final recording before his death in 2019.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
