<p>There’s been plenty of scholastic sports taking place over the opening week of the season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is a quick recap of some of the action from last week:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bristol Central softball starts the season winning its first two games</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After throttling Newington on Monday by a 14-2 push, the softball team from Central made its first road trip of the season to Rocky Hill – battling the Terriers in a CCC Interdivisional tilt on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams came away winners again, sinking Rocky Hill by a 7-1 final to push Central’s ledger to a perfect 2-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This game was about the seniors as Alex Sciarretto shut down the Terriers from the circle while Sophia Torreso was big from the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto was on fire from the start, allowing Rocky Hill precious little in offense while striking out 14 batters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the flip&nbsp;side, Torreso blasted out her first career home run to pace the offensive onslaught over a seven-hit attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, the Rams average 10.5 runs-per-game while giving up just 1.5 defensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming week, Central is in action three times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, the Rams travel to Middletown for a battle from Pat Kidney Softball field at high noon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, Central takes on Plainville (11 a.m.) for the first and only time this season while traveling to Pomperaug on Friday in a non-conference affair, starting at 1:45 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Central girls lacrosse starts the campaign at 1-0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams opened their season last Tuesday on the road and easily defeated Enfield by a 16-7 throttling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaylynn LaPointe was the high scorer on the day with five goals to lead the offensive charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emily Lowe and Rachel Wygant each blasted in four goals as the duo accounted for eight big scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Amy Pelletier played a solid game in the net to keep the Eagles at bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is back to work on Monday against the contingent from Middletown/Coginchaug.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 6 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eastern softball wins for the first time in 2023</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The softball squad over on King Street, after a tough loss to Berlin to open the season, was able to topple Simsbury this past Thursday in a CCC interdivisional showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams moved to 1-1 off the Lancers’ 21-9 win as the locals needed just five innings to wrap up the victory from the softball field in front of BEHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After blasting out a home run against the Redcoats, Emily Valentine roped up a 4-for-4 day against the Trojans.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also against Simsbury, Grace Browne and Kayla Webber each added multi-hit games to the tilt to pace the Eastern offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next Wednesday, the Lancers are back in action in a rematch against Berlin - this time from Sage Park at 11 a.m.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
