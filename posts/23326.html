<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;What would rivalry night be without a down to the wire showdown between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys JV basketball teams?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday night, both programs held late leads in the showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with 16 seconds left, the Lancers’ Donte DePass spun and drained the game-winning hoop as Eastern downed Central by a 42-41 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brett Bisson’s JV program at Eastern was able to hold off Joe DeFillippi’s grouping though both squads had a chance to take the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass led the Lancers with 14 points, Owen Myers added 12 while Chase Dauphinee posted 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Harry Ross led all players with 16 points, Jaysun Dominguez nabbed nine while teammate Nate Ortiz dropped in eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 13-6 through one period of play as DePass flipped in seven points over the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, Dauphinee (seven points) and Owens (six) notched all the points for the Lancers as the home team scooped up a 26-18 edge at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third quarter, Central struck right back to take the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dominguez, Ortiz and Ross combined for 17 third period points and through three completed frames, Eastern trailed 35-33.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over an aggressive fourth frame, Central surged in front 39-35 with less than five minutes to play in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern recaptured the lead moments later as Mikey Sherill found DePass for his only 3 of the game and when Dauphinee cashed in a hoop off a steal by Sherill, the Kingstreeters were ahead 40-39 with 3:13 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams traded misses before Ross, who misfired on two free throws with 1:38 left, made a quick steal for a lay-up to give Central a 41-40 lead just 14 seconds later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had possession of the ball, calling timeout with 55.6 seconds remaining, but DePass made a slick steal, was later fouled but Eastern was not yet in the bonus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the Lancers were patient, worked the ball around, and DePass cashed in on his game-winner but Central took one last shot at it with 16 second left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the game, Dominguez - hounded by Myers - eventually got the ball over to Quincy Lawson.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lawson’s 3 was short at the buzzer as Eastern came away with a huge one-point victory over its crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>In the freshmen game, Central got the best of Eastern by a 57-34 final. The Rams got 12 points from Jayden Glasper, Cody Roy added 11 while Quincy Lawson nabbed 10.</p>
