<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Blues of the New England Collegiate Baseball League continue to hang around .500 this season - keeping pace with some of the top squads in the league.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Sunday morning, the Blues are 12-13 with one tie to their name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is just a game out of first place, trailing Western Division leading Valley Blue Sox by a single game (14-14).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the top three teams in the West are separated by only two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third place Danbury Westerners (11-15) are just two games out of the top spot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight, Bristol and Danbury tangle from Muzzy Field at 5 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past 10 games, Bristol is the only squad from the West to have a record better than .500 (5-4-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>North Adams (7-18) is at the bottom of the standings but went 4-6 over its past 10 contests, showing vast improvement as of late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Costal Division, the Newport Gulls (21-5) have the best record in the NECBL and are running away with things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the North, the Vermont Mountaineers are hanging in the first place chase (17-10-1) while the Upper Valley Nighthawks (14-9) are right in the mix as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol batting check</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one thing you can count on with the Blues is the squad can hit the long ball a time or two during the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Blues’ slugger Daniel Hussey has three homers in just 43 at-bats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s second on the squad in RBI as well with 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin Noriega is the current leader in RBI with 15 while his batting average of .284 is one of the top marks on the Bristol squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s currently 23-of-81 from the plate, scoring nine runs along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those 23 hits also lead the Bristol program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Billy Sullivan has 16 hits while Cal Parrillo and Skye Selinsky each have contributed 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dixon Black has 10 hits for the Blues this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How about the pitching?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Bristol Eastern standout Jagger Duquette has put together a pretty complete season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s thrown over 20 innings, fanning 17, walking just four while carrying a tremendous ERA of 1.32.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His strikeout total is good for third place on the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette has started four games, carries an overall record of 1-0, allowed nine hits and carries a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.3-to-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His lone win came on June 16 in Bristol’s 4-1 triumph over Keene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In five innings, Duquette chucked a five-inning shutout that saw him yield just one hit while striking out a half dozen batters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Justin Solimine and Luke Benneche each have complied 22 Ks while Mason Ulsh and Peter Phillips (two saves) are both 2-1 this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Brent Francisco has three saves in 6.2 innings of action, carrying a clean ERA of 0.00 out of the bullpen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lots of ball left to be played</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next eight days, the Blues will be in the thick of it in terms of NECBL action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, the Blues travel to North Shore but the squad won’t be on the road for long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday sees Bristol back in action from Muzzy Field as the squad squares off against Danbury (6:30 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, North Adams invades Bristol while the following day, Valley shows up to town for a big tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both contests commence at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming Saturday, the Blues take a trip to square off against North Adams (5 p.m.) before returning to the Mum City on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol battles Sanford on Sunday evening at 5 p.m. at Muzzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Coaches</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues are managed by Tim Binkowski while former Bristol Merchants standout Kevin Rival is the pitching coach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mark Stephens is the Blues hitting coach in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
