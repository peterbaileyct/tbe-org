<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew again! Community Day was so much fun, and I met so many Trainers in Rockwell Park! There is another Community Day happening soon, and I’ll share some more details about it later in the article. Here are some Trainers that participated in Community Day. (I am behind Team Rocket.)</p>

<p>Mega Heracross is finally coming to raids near you! This is a one-day event happening on Saturday, April 13, at 2 p.m. and ends at 5 p.m. Heracross does come in as a shiny form, but the challenge won’t be easy. As a bug and fighting type Pokémon, flying type Pokémon will be able to beat this one with ease. Hurricane is the move of choice here, dealing massive damage during this raid battle. </p>

<p>The best Pokémon for the tasks are Staraptor, Moltres, Yveltal, Rayquaza and Honchkrow. You also can get up to five additional raid passes by spinning the gyms that day, so stock up on potions and revives to get the best Heracross you can! If you want to check out the other hotspots for this event, look below:</p>

<p>Community Bellsprout Day is coming soon! It’s starts on Saturday, April 20. You can catch the Flower Pokémon and the shiny form too! It’s from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. I will be doing this event over in Rockwell Park, so if you are there, you can meet me in person! During this time, you can teach it Magical Leaf, a super effective grass type move for this Pokémon.</p>

<p>GO Fest is right around the corner, really, it’s in three months. Necrozma is making its debut appearance in Pokémon GO! The Global GO fest is on July 13 and 14, however, the best experience for this event will be in New York City between the 5th and 7th.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
