<p>BRISTOL - Against a winless Simsbury American Legion program, the 19U squad from Bristol brought up a couple young arms in an attempt to gain a little experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Bristol suffered a tough 10-1 setback to Simsbury on Sunday afternoon, the duo of Caleb Molinsky and Gavin Colvin got a chance to throw in a 19U game.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky drew the loss though he showed some poise over his four innings, striking out four and allowing only six hits, while Colvin allowed four runs on five hits&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Jose Feliciano kept the seventh and final inning - against regulars in the Simsbury batting order - scoreless.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three of those pitchers could see starting and spot duty as the year roles along for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I brought Gavin up today to see what he could do,” said LaPenta of Colvin. “He was nervous, and Caleb was a little nervous. I could see it in his face in the first inning. Even though these guys played a little [high school] varsity, Caleb started three games for Bristol Eastern, when you’re here and now [you’re playing] against 19-year-old kids, it’s a little different.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky was a part of the Bristol Eastern rotation in 2023, along with Declan Schenck, and those two chuckers should see more time on the hill as the summer month's role along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think Caleb is going to be okay for us,” said LaPenta. “I’m going to need him. I’m kind of short pitching this year for 19U.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wolcott players in the mix</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game against Simsbury was basically tryouts for a large grouping of Wolcott players - fresh off their tough 10-8 loss to Nonnewaug in the Class M title game - have brand new assignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those new players to the Bristol program include Nick Sconziano (second base) along with Josh Dunne (left field) and Joe Dunne (catcher), getting their first innings in a Bristol American Legion uniform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, while new players have arrived, the chemistry is simply not going to be there - yet - for the outfit from Post 2</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Dunne boys and Sconziano all gave glimpses of what they could add to the team as the season progresses for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had three new kids today, trying to get that puzzle together,” said LaPenta of the players from Wolcott.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase Belisle would have started at catcher today but had a later commitment to a team from the Tri-State Baseball League and was moved over to Designated Hitter instead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And asking a 19-year-old to catch two games in two different leagues was something LaPenta was not going to force upon the young man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, LaPenta gave the start to Joe Dunne along with the other standouts from Wolcott around the horn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today was kind of a tryout/game, trying to figure out how to work people in, what the deal is going to be,” said LaPenta. “It’s a long season over a short time. After three games, were 1-1 with a tie. I thought we played well in the first two games.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today was just a stinker and you’re going to have that every once in a while.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What towns represent the Bristol 19U program team this year?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Sunday, Post 2 consisted of players from Bristol Eastern, one from Bristol Central, Wolcott and even Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s as diverse a roster Bristol has ever put together in senior American Legion baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was going to be a smattering of Plainville players mixed in and one player could still be in the running before the final roster is turned in by LaPenta and his crew.</p>
