<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, this past Friday, he made a game-saving play that propelled WPI to a huge win over Bridgewater State.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Engineers were ahead in the showdown when Bridgewater, trailing by three points, was running out of time with less than 10 seconds to go in regulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program decided to try a 23-yard field goal in an attempt to tie the contest and force overtime from its own home field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Curtin wasn’t in the mood for overtime on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up blocking the attempt as the Engineers held on to win by a 24-21 final as Curtin made one of the biggest defensive stops of his career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his effort, he was selected as the New England’s Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Football Special Teams Athlete of the Week for the week of September 10th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The attempted kick didn’t have a chance as Curtin simply rose above the defensive line and batted the ball out of the air to stop the play dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a clutch performance in a primetime position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curtin played well throughout the showdown against Bridgewater, nabbing a 13-yard reception while adding an assisted tackle to complete a solid effort for WPI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curtin, sporting a bit of a mustache in his bio on the WPI website, is in his senior season for the Engineers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot-1, 210-pound wide receiver has played in two games for WPI this season, compiling three receptions for 31 yards (10.3 yards-per-catch) as the program is undefeated to date (2-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first career weekly NEWMAC award for Curtin - a well-deserved honor for an athlete who completed with maximum effort on the gridiron for the Lancers over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Eastern, Curtin was a tough out at quarterback - a competitor that always gave it his all on the gridiron or on the hardwood as a forward for the program under coach boys basketball coach Bunty Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curtin was the Kingstreeters’ full-time quarterback in 2019, nearly throwing for 800 yards as a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw for six touchdowns and rushed for 150 yards and a touchdown to complete his final season on the turf at BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He worked hard scholastically under head coach Anthony Julius and all that effort led to a spot on WPI’s football roster.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curtin came to WPI as a 180-pound freshmen and certainly filled out as his senior campaign rolled around in 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He came onto the collegiate scene as a quarterback but settled nicely into his current wide receiver role - doing a little of everything on both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, WPI is home against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in a confrontation from H. Carr Field at Alumni Stadium on Saturday, September 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 5 p.m.</p>
