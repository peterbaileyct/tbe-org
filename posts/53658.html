<p>Come Sunday morning, Election Day is behind us. We have a new president--for the second time--and the analysts are checking in with their different experiences and commentary. The bottom line is that the American people have spoken, loudly, and surprisingly, as once again, the polls performed less robustly than expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, here at home, it has been quiet.  (And, yes, Mary will return as State Representative for the 79th District.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting was successful in Bristol. The numbers who turned out were significant. In addition, statewide the ballot measure that allows for no-excuse absentee balloting passed easily. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weekend is a celebration of our veterans, with events throughout the day today and tomorrow--right through the end of the month with special Thanksgiving Day meals for veterans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of special note today, there is the free "Salute to Veterans" concert at the Rockwell Theater on Memorial Boulevard. That is 3 p.m. today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomorrow there is the Veterans Day Celebration, also at the Rockwell Theater, 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Once again, for those in the giving mindset--it is that time of year -- our donation link is up. Some people have discovered this themselves and are responding with donations. Thank you so much, to those who have taken that step to support us financially. There is not time like the present to join them, click <a href="https://bristoledition.fundjournalism.org/support-our-work">here</a> or look to our message at the end of this column which also has a link.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With sound financial support, we can improve--i.e., increase--our coverage of local government by providing more regular stories about what is happening at city hall, so that each of us has information to form our own opinions about where Bristol is and where we are going.  </p>

<p>For listening, I turned to the "Honestly with Bari Weiss" podcast, episode "Why Trump Won." Again, these listening sessions are ones I recommend because they present positions that challenge conventional thinking and positions. This particular podcast is long, so be prepared. Click <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-trump-won/id1570872415?i=1000676042358">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are plenty of others. I highly recommend taking time this week to bounce around any podcast venue for podcasts that present positions that might challenge yours. One that was recommended to me is Michael Smerconish's podcast featuring Allan Lichtman, the historian and creator of 13 keys to choosing the winner of a presidential election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lichtman, based on his own system, had been 9 of 10 when it came to previous elections. He chose Kamala Harris to win this time. Smerconish, who is a fan of the keys, had Lichtman on his podcast and discussed where the keys, or interpretation, failed. Click <a href="https://www.smerconish.com/podcasts/the-smerconish-podcast/">here</a>.  Scroll to E1123, "Harris Didn't Win: Allan Lichtman on where his 13 keys went wrong."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For reading, I finished "Martyr" by Kaveh Akbar. It's a terrific read with an ending that leaves plenty of room for interpretation. Now I am on to the late Lore Segal's "First American." An Austrian-American novelist, Lore passed in October. I read her obituary and decided it might be a good idea to read her books. For information about Segal, check her Wikipedia page, by clicking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lore_Segal">here</a>.  </p>
