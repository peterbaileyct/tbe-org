<p>Hundreds filled Centre Square on Saturday for the opening day of the 2023 Bristol Farmers Market. The forecasted heavy rains held off, providing ideal conditions for vendors and patrons alike. </p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting all winter for this to open,” said Nancy Wilson. “I come for the vegetables, but I always end up getting myself some soap, or a dipped Oreos maybe a pastry and coffee. I would buy almost everything if I could.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Local businesses and farms offered a wide variety of products including fresh produce, coffee, sweet treats, and other locally produced consumable products. Eager patrons like Nancy Wilson lined up at 10 a.m. to patronize their favorite vendors.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
