<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the second consecutive season, the annual girls City Series Cross Country meet was won by an underclassman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that harrier, Bristol Eastern sophomore Kaelyn Gonzalez, hardly resembles a youngster on the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She made a tremendous impact as a freshman at BEHS, storming the scene and seizing the city series championship on a freezing Saturday morning from St. Paul Catholic High School last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her time of 22:00 flat was 43 seconds better than the runner up, putting her on the scholastic map.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That trail was relatively flat, encompassing Stafford Avenue, but Gonzalez led from wire to wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isn’t that a familiar sequence at just about every race Gonzalez takes a part of?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, in the rematch this past Thursday at Rockwell Park between the city schools, the speedster once again dominated - spinning up a winning time of 22:51.5 while runner-up, St. Paul Catholic sophomore Gretchen Radcliff, finished in 23:33.3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was like a lot of pressure to keep the pace going and trying to get first place again for the second year in a row,” said Gonzalez of the win. “But I’m really happy I did it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city series battles between Gonzalez and Radcliff should be fun over the next couple of years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The course</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cross country course at Rockwell Park might not contain the hills and different elevation that Page Park challenges harriers with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rockwell has its own challenges and isn’t the preverbal day in the park when it comes to cross country events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The hill in the back is really high up,” said Gonzalez. “And it’s really hard to get up but once I got to the top, I was good from there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rockwell is probably the best representation of outdoor running between the three schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Page has more hills than the law should legally allow, the course at St. Paul Catholic is on the flat side -- much like Plainville -- while Rockwell has tremendous balance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that’s what makes the annual event so special as the schools rotate the hosting duties with those different trails and seeing a different course every season makes the City Series bout different and challenging when October rolls around each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, will Gonzalez, when it comes time for her junior campaign, go for the trifecta with a first-place victory at home from Page Park - giving her a clean sweep of the courses in Bristol over City Series meets?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can we fast forward to 2024 already?</p>
