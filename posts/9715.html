<p>The City of Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services (BPRYCS) Department’s 24th Annual Turkey Shoot Basketball Contest was held at Chippens Hill Middle School on Saturday, November 20th.<br><br>The Turkey Shoot saw tons of points put on the board, as Bristol youth ages 4-13-years-old partnered with a teammate to sink as many foul shots as possible. The Turkey Shoot competition was split into 5 divisions, based on age, with the winning teams from each division winning a $25 dollar gift card to Price Chopper to be used to purchase a turkey.</p>

<p><br>Over 125 participants signed up to compete across six divisions. Although the winners of each division received the Price Chopper gift card, all participants were eligible for numerous raffle prizes, and each youth participant received a 24th Annual Turkey Shoot Basketball Contest t-shirt.<br><br>“BPRYCS would not have been able to offer such a high-level event without the support and buy-in from the groups within our community. Price Chopper, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Zach Ibanez’s State Farm, BEST, Firehouse Subs, and Spare Time all contributed to this year’s Turkey Shoot. These contributions ensured that each youth participant was able to go home with a prize from the event,” said Amry Shelby, Recreation Supervisor of Bristol Parks.</p>
