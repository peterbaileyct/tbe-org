<p>An evening of family-friendly music and comedy is coming to the Rockwell Theater on Saturday for the highly anticipated "Animaniacs in Concert."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“I am most excited for the nostalgia of it all,” BPRYCS Arts &amp; Culture Supervisor Arianna Therriault said. “Being able to see these incredibly talented voice actors and musicians perform bits from beloved 90's cartoons, right here in Bristol; that’s really special.”</p>

<p>"Animaniacs" is an animated comedy series that originally ran from 1993 to 1999, with three revival seasons returning from 2020 to 2023. The classic cartoon stars Yakko and Wakko, the “Warner Brothers” and the “Warner Sister”, Dot, Pinky and the Brain and a large cast of various zany characters. </p>

<p>In addition to clever stories and short skits, many episodes of "Animaniacs" featured witty songs and parodies, including fan favorites “Yakko’s World,” “I Am the Very Model of a Cartoon Individual” and “The Ballad of Magellan.” </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I loved 'Animaniacs'!” Therriault said, “I think a lot of people are really looking forward to seeing it live.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Animaniacs" in Concert will feature selections of the beloved cartoon tunes sung live with instrumental accompaniment and backed by the original projected animation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The nationally touring show stars the show's original Emmy-Winning composer, Randy Rogel, on piano and the voice talents of Emmy winner Rob Paulsen (Yakko &amp; Pinky on "Animaniacs;" Raphael on "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles") and Maurice LaMarche (The Brain on "Animaniacs;" Kif &amp; Calculon on "Futurama").</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The evening promises to capture the excitement and nostalgia of Saturday morning cartons for adult attendees while providing comedic entertainment for a new generation of younger theatergoers. Therriault, who watched "Animaniacs" as a child, stated that Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services hope to make some everlasting memories with shows like this one.</p>

<p>“I think folks who come with kids will be able to laugh along with their children to what they once grew up watching,” Therriault said. “Those moments and memories are so special, and to make them at this theater is really magical!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think theater goers will also be able to just have a nice evening out with their friends and family,” Theriault continued, “laughing along with Randy Rogel, Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche as they perform some favorites from Warner Brothers Studios.” </p>

<p>"Animaniacs in Concert" will be held Saturday, Feb. 17, at 6 p.m. at the Rockwell Theater. Doors will open at 5 p.m., tickets are $26 for children 10 and under and $36 for adults.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
