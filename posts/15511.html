<p>“We have a great group of volunteers who come out for the events we have. It’s a beautiful day and everyone is having fun.”</p>

<p>The large crowd brought camping chairs and blankets to lounge under shady trees and take in the beauty of the 280-acre preserve. Guests had the opportunity to meet the resident animals of the Indian Rock Nature Preserve, including Jade the cow and Mabel the pig. Part of the profits from the musical event will be put towards the care of the farm’s 4-legged inhabitants.</p>

<p>“The profits will be used for education programs for school children and summer camp. They’ll also be used to support our farm animals. We’re having a special fundraising opportunity today to adopt a farm animal.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the adoptable animals are the lovable avian couple Tom and Henrietta. Their adoption profiles show that Tom likes strutting and dancing the turkey trot, while Henrietta enjoys long strolls and presidential pardons.</p>

<p>“They’re always together and they’re a cute couple,” said Heth. “Wherever Tom goes, Henrietta goes.” In addition to turkeys, the farm is home to about 40 chickens that Heth affectionally calls “the girls.” Their farm-fresh eggs are sold at the Barnes Nature Center on Shrub Road.</p>
