<p>BRISTOL – The Newport Gulls and the Bristol Blues will try to give it a go again on Tuesday night in game two of the New England Collegiate Baseball League Championship series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, which was slated for Monday night from Muzzy Field, was rescheduled due to rain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game two is scheduled for tonight at 6:30 from Muzzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues, ranked No. 6 in the NECBL field, trail the top-ranked Gulls 1-0 after falling to the squad 7-2 from Cardines Field in Rhode Island in the first game of the best-of-three series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol now must win on both Tuesday and Wednesday to take the Fay Vincent, Sr Cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one from Rhode Island on Sunday evening, the Gulls Billy Butler went 2-for-4 with two hits and two RBIs to lead the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied the go-ahead RBI single in the sixth inning to help Newport scoop up a 3-2 lead that was never again threatened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Gulls added an insurance run in the seventh stanza and three more in the eighth to seal the deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newport, trailing 2-1 going into the bottom of the sixth stanza, outhit Bristol 12-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Griffin Arnone went 2-for-3 with a blistering home run, driving in two runs overall, to lead the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His homer made it a 2-1 game but the Blues were not able to hold on in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jordan Peyton, Skye Selinsky and Connor Goodman all generated hits for the locals while Peter Ostensen absorbed a tough loss on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ostensen went 5.2 innings, allowing six hits, three earned runs, a single walk while nabbing four strikeouts over a solid performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the third, Bristol scored the first run of the contest to grab some early momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Billy Sullivan started the jaunt by getting hit-by-a-pitch while Goodman’s single put two men on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arnone then singled home Sullivan as Bristol secured a 1-0 push through three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that early edge did not hold as Newport outscored Bristol 7-1 the rest of the way to secure a huge five-run win and get within a game of taking the Fay Vincent, Sr. Cup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Duquette is up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s own Jagger Duquette (4-0) is scheduled to take the mound tonight, putting his undefeated streak on the line in this win or go home challenge. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Blues can earn the victory tonight, the squads will play a winner-take-all championship game on Wednesday from Cardines Field at 6:35 p.m.</p>
