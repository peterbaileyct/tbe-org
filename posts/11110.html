<p>A new development in the ongoing Wheeler Clinic drama has emerged recently. Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller announced on his Facebook page that the City of Bristol Economic and Community Development Committee had received revised plans for Wheeler Clinic to come to Centre Square on a different lot than previously proposed. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new plan calls for the movement of the planned city Green and affords Wheeler Clinic the opportunity to obtain a slightly smaller lot for their corporate headquarters which includes treatment offices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new lot arrangement allows for the larger lot, originally planned for Wheeler, to be available for future development for additional retail/entertainment/residential space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The motion passed the ECD by a bipartisan, unanimous vote with full support of every ECD Commissioner, Mayor Caggiano, and Councilman Panioto. It now moves on to the City Council for their vote at the next City Council meeting on Tuesday, February 8, 2022 at City Council Chambers. </p>

<p>In the announcement, no mention was made as to what will then happen to the plan for a city green on Centre Square.</p>
