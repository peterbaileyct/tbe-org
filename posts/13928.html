<p>BRISTOL – For the first time since the 2005 campaign, the Bristol Central softball team is heading back to the state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And behind another tremendous pitching effort by Pia Torreso, the fifth ranked Rams picked off top seeded Danbury by a 4-1 final from DeLuca Field in Stratford on Monday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (22-4) earned its trip to the title game and will battle No. 2 Southington – a 7-3 winner over No. 3 Fairfield Ludlowe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That showdown, which marks the third meeting between the two powerhouses this season, will commence either Friday or Saturday with <strong>DeLuca Field in Stratford a possible venue for the title tilt.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the semifinal attraction, the Hatters didn’t have an answer from the dish against Central’s recently minted 2022 CHSCA All-State Class LL pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in her biggest game to date, Torreso shined when all the lights were at their brightest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso allowed just the one run on two hits, walking only one while fanning 12 to completely shut down the Danbury offense (23-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big-time performance, one of many that day by the Rams, leading to a Class LL state championship berth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pia was un-hittable besides the home run in the seventh,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “[She] had total command of her pitches.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the time Danbury was finally able to scratch across a run, it was far too late as Central had already constructed a 4-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Hatters only scooped up hits during the fourth and seventh innings and that offense was spaced very nicely by the Central’s defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Central ramped up five hits but put up single runs over the first, second, fifth, and sixth frames to keep the pressure on the Hatters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first frame with Sam Sklenka on, Leah Sklenka’s base hit scored the lead runner as Central nabbed a 1-0 push through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Romano came home in the second inning off a misplayed ball hit by Lorelei Stancavage as Central’s lead increased 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lorelei and Leah came up big early,” said Hayes of Stancavage and Sklenka. “And Sam [Sklenka] was solid on the bases once again.&nbsp;“</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And later in the game, both Sklenka’s posted insurance runs to make it a 4-0 contest through six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Sklenka came home on an error in the fifth while Sam Sklenka tagged the dish in the sixth off a passed ball as the Rams were clearly cruising to a big finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the bottom of the seventh, Masuk’s Kaylee Drago blasted out a home run for the Hatters only run of the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the end, it simply wouldn’t be enough as Central punched its state title ticket via the 4-1 win over the top seed in all of Class LL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a rare occurrence, it’s going to be an All-CCC championship affair as the two neighboring towns will go to battle for the state’s biggest prize.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…In the bottom part of the bracket, Southington and Fairfield Ludlowe went toe-to-toe through three innings as the teams battled to a 3-3 stalemate. But the Knights went for four runs in the bottom of the fourth to ice the contest as Southington grabbed a 7-3 win to advance to the championship round against the Rams…Central will be looking for its second ever title in girls softball – last winning it all in 1985…The showdown against Central will be Southington’s 25<sup>th</sup> Class LL championship appearance in school history…The Knights are 1-0 in the championship round against the Rams, having defeated Central (2-0) back in the 2004 title game under then head coach Phil Pirog.</p>
