<p>The Bristol Central girls lacrosse team picked up two victories last week, moving to 3-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, the Rams zipped up a hard-fought 7-5 victory over Lewis Mills in a CCC South confrontation from the turf field at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was another back-and-forth contest but Central was able to tally all the big goals late.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaylynn LaPointe, Abby Duval and Emily Lowe all notched two goals apiece for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Emma Burciaga’s goal helped push out the Rams’ edge late over the fray.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the net, Central’s Amy Pelletier nabbed 11 saves as the Spartans ended up drawing a tough loss.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the following Friday, Central was back at the pay window again - seizing a critical 7-4 victory against Wolcott in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the hottest day of the season to date, the Eagles just couldn’t keep pace against the Rams’ offense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPointe zipped up three goals and three assists to lead the charge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lowe flipped in two goals while Brooke Patnode and Duval also added a score to the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pelletier, flanked by her defense, played well as Wolcott scored just four goals. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only setback for the Bristol squad this season came last Monday against the coop from Middletown/Coginchaug.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors picked up an 8-7 win but that’s been the only blemish for the Rams to date.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This week, Central continues its outstanding play in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, the locals battle double-tough Wethersfield and then on Friday, Edwin O. Smith travels in from Storrs for a CCC South confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time for both home bouts is 4 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
