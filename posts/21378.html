<p>BRISTOL – Last season, the Bristol Central and Gilbert girls basketball teams squared off in a huge confrontation from the Bristol Central Holiday Classic on December 29, 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Yellowjackets wrangled up a huge 20-point plus lead but saw it completely evaporate before freshmen guard Emily Arel hit some critical buckets late to lead her team to a 62-56 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exactly one year later, the teams were back at it and Arel, now a slick shooting sophomore, was once again standing in the Rams’ way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this time around, it was Central that had all the defensive answers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arel was limited to just 19 points and was clearly tired off some staunch Central defense as the Rams squared away a huge 63-30 win from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The win propelled the Rams’ program to the BC Holiday Classic championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Kaley Laird (four points) helped to slow Arel early before foul trouble put her on the bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Callie Lodovico - and a host of other players - all helped push Arel to the brink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s what we talked about all day in practice yesterday” said Central coach Steve Gaudet about defending Arel. “We had a phenomenal practice [the day before]. We talked about how it was going to be a team effort, defensively and offensively. Kaley was outstanding and then Callie coming to play defense on her…that girl [Arel] is so talented, so skilled and is a hard worker.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We held her to 19 and our goal was to keep her under twenty.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central threw the proverbial kitchen sink at Arel as Central’s defenders are all able to slow down the impressive scorer from Gilbert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rest of the Yellowjackets' squad managed just 11 total points which manifested itself into a very tough night for the Winsted squad in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we kept her under twenty, we thought we had a chance to win the game,” said Gaudet of Arel. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, five players from Central tallied double figures in scoring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adrianna Rivera led the charge with 14 points while Callie Lodovico added 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Watson scored 12, Leilani Jackson nabbed 10 while Nicole Riemer notched her 10 points off the bench as balance was the key.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four lead changes highlighted a back-and-forth first frame of play before Watson hit a floater - plus a foul - and when she calmly sank the charity toss, Central led it for good at 7-6 with 4:37 remaining in the period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That one point edge eventually was pushed out to eight before the home team settled on an 18-12 lead through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lead grew to 28-14 with 3:39 to play before the half as Watson canned another jumper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arel nearly had to back to single digits late in the second but another hoop from Watson, a slick floater by Laird and an offensive rebound and put-back by Rivera at the halftime horn pushed Central’s edge to 34-17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would Central relent after the break and allow Arel and company to get back in the game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not in the least as the Rams used an 11-4 burst to put the thing out of reach over the first four minutes of the third quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two jumpers by Jackson started the quarter and when Laird banked a basket in with 3:15 to go in the third, the contest was a 47-23 blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I don’t think I could have preached it anymore in the locker room [at the half] about how important those first four minutes were,” said Gaudet. “Because against South Windsor at the beginning of the season, we had a big lead against them and [lost] it. But these kids are young and they’re learning. We’re competing. Every day, we’re getting better. It’s still a long season but I’m pretty proud of the effort we gave tonight.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arel was trying to single-handily keep her squad in reach but even as she dropped in a field goal after a basket from Rivera, Gilbert trailed 51-26 with just eight minutes remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a banked by Rivera shot found the bottom of the net, Arel drained a 3 with 5:49 left that trimmed the deficit back to 24 at 53-29.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Arel did not score again as the Yellowjackets tallied just a single foul shot the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the contest, Riemer hustled for the final six points of the affair and at the final horn, Central moved to 4-2 with its tremendous 63-30 victory over Gilbert to win its first ever Bristol Central Holiday Classic title.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was just an outstanding effort from top to bottom,” said Gaudet. “All the girls, I couldn’t be prouder.”&nbsp;</p>
