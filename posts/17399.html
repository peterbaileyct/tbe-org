<p>Helloooo Thuuuursday! We are glad you are here, but you need to get out of the way and make room for Friday. Seriously, go. Shoo!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s weather, 69 degrees, rainy and possible thunderstorms. Madness!</p>

<h3>Bristol, today in five seconds maybe 10</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight, there is a special city council meeting. For the last time or until it comes up again, cannabis, cannabis, cannabis!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even money on the mayor saying "codify" during the meeting, and Cheryl Thibeault being the voice of reason. You go, Cheryl!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of codify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Open letter</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Mayor Caggiano (or whoever reads your mail),</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is Halloween legalized panhandling?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If so, maybe we should “codify” it so some drunk-with-power city council in the future does not ban it. Just an idea, don’t get all nervous and adjust your tie or anything crazy like that. Oh wait, never mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol</p>

<p>P.S. What’s your shoe size?</p>

<h3>Bristol Trivia</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone knows Buzz Aldrin was the second person to walk the moon, but few know the third. With that in mind, who was the third chairman of the Mum Festival?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bonus: Who was the third person to walk on the moon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
