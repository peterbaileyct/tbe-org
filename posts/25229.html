<p>After failing to score in the first 2 innings, St.Paul batted around and scored six runs in the top of the third inning. Logan Rembish reached safely on an infield error and Jamie Leggett singled to put two men on. Devin Kulas followed with a single to load the bases. Catcher Cal Chance doubled to score Rembish and Leggett. Then Ryan Kilpatrick's ground ball was fielded cleanly, but the throw home was wild allowing Kulas to score. Cole Raymond then tripled driving in Chance and Kilpatrick. Raymond scored on Jonathan Remillard's RBI single, and St Paul led 6-0. White retired the next three batters to end the inning.</p>

Then in the top of the 6th, Rembish led off with a single, Leggett followed with a single, and Kulas hit a two RBI triple. Chance hit a SAC fly to left to score Kulas, and St. Paul led 9-0.</p>

<p>Seymour mounted a rally in the bottom of the 7th, but failed to score. Lead off hitter Jason Beaudry reached safely on an infield error. With one out, Colby Ruggerio and Shane White hit back-to-back singles to load the bases, and chase Wilson from the mound. Dom Napoletano came in to relieve Wilson and got an infield fly and a fly ball to center to end the game.</p>
