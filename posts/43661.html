<p>Bristol Public Library and Manross Memorial Library will be participating in Passport to Connecticut Libraries 2024, which offers four individuals the chance to win $200 Visa gift cards from a random drawing of all program participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a person, adult or child, visits at least five (5) participating libraries and returns their Passport to a participating library by May 10, they will be entered into a state-wide drawing for a chance to win a $200 Visa gift card for adults (18 and up) and a $200 Visa gift card for children (under 18). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a state-wide contest where four winners will be selected: one adult and one child from a random drawing from all returned Passports with at least five separate library stamps, and the one adult and one child who visited the most libraries/received the most stamps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program began April 1 and continues through April 30. Not all Connecticut libraries are participating libraries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To begin in Bristol, visit either the Bristol Public Library or Manross memorial for a passport. The librarian will stamp passport (and possibly add a token gift). Then, take a passport along to other participating libraries where, after producing a library card, the librarian will stamp the passport (and possibly hand over another small gift).</p>

<p>For more details and a full list of participating libraries are available at the library.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
