<p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. - How many additional awards can the duo of Karly Martin and Myah Croze scoop up for the women’s soccer program over at Western Connecticut State University?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, the Little East Conference (LEC) continues to heap several postseason awards and honors on the former Bristol Eastern girls soccer standouts and the least surprised person - in terms of realizing the success the duo enjoyed at Western over the years - is their former scholastic coach, Scott Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am not surprised&nbsp;at all with the success Myah and Karly are having,” admitted Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The LEC Champions went 18-2 overall and qualified for the NCAA Division III championships, falling to Franklin and Marshall by a 2-1 final in first round play on November 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze, the outstanding junior competitor, scored an early goal in the match but the locals could not sustain the edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin, the senior keeper for the program, zipped up seven saves in the match as WestConn made its 15th appearance in the national tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that combination from Bristol was all over the LEC’s 2021 women's soccer postseason award list, following a vote of the league's coaches in mid-November.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Martin was named the 2021 LEC Defensive Player of the Year and was a First Team All-LEC selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Karly was one of the most athletic female athletes I coached in my career,” said Redman. “Her ability to read and react to shots was second to none and her work ethic and positivity separated her from the rest. With elite level coaching at Western, I am not shocked in the least with her leap forward and continued success.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scooped up a league-best 0.52 goals against average and carried a tremendous .909 save percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the start of the NCAA Tournament, Martin allowed just eight goals while registering 93 saves - the third-most in the conference. Martin ranked third in Division III in save percentage and 23rd in goals against average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Croze, the scoring wizard over her scholastic days over on King Street in Bristol, was named the 2021 LEC Offensive Player of Year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Myah was always a soccer freak,” said Redman. “She lived, breathed and ate soccer from a young age. Her ability on the field was incredible&nbsp;to watch. Once she found the school that fit her style and comfort level, she had the opportunity to really excel. I am not surprised by her sensational season, albeit it has been truly amazing to watch and root for her from the sidelines during an incredible scoring and winning streak.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she was once again extremely offensive for the program at WestConn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A First Team All-LEC selection, Croze led the conference in scoring with a league-best 27 goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also tallied seven assists for 61 points overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Croze kicked in a LEC-best eight game-winning goals, putting her in the top three in all of Division III in goals and points scored while tied for third in game-winning goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am incredibly proud of them and they deserve all the accolades&nbsp;this season has brought to them,” said Redman.</p>
