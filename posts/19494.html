<p>BRISTOL - The Central Connecticut Conference has a dangerous alignment of volleyball programs - any of which could qualify for semifinal round play and beyond in the 2022 Class L bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Central (15-8) and Bristol Eastern (11-8) are in the mix, drawing positions over the top 11 over a crowded field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, playing a very aggressive regular season slate, earned the seventh ranking and squares off against No. 26 Ledyard - the second lowest rated program in all the Class L field - from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of BCHS on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be the first showdown between the programs this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central will turn to its senior crew of Brooke Valentino, Olivia Clingan, Maddie Lodovico and Sam Sklenka along with junior setter Alex Rivera, sophomore Grace Higgins and freshman sensation Lily Kirk to win the first round clash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams certainly have enough skill and talent to make a deep run into state tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the opposite side of the city, Eastern takes its first shot at a different CCC opponent this season in first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eleventh ranked Lancers battle No. 22 Windsor in a showdown from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a second round rematch from 2021, a bout that saw the Kingstreeters sweep the Warriors 3-0. Set scores were 25-13, 26-24 and 25-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor was a pesky bunch last year and expect more of the same come Tuesday (6 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Expect more than a couple loud swings from Eastern senior Lauren Bender along with Lilli Lowe and junior Adrianna Reay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Juniors Jayna Hatcher, Emma Cretella and Andrea Martir-Perez will also be counted on for contributions along with sophomore Emily Valentine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s showdown also commences on Tuesday at the same time as Eastern’s first round extravaganza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joel Barlow, a perennial Class L power, did not draw a loss during regular season play and is ranked No. 1 in the Class L field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here is how the tournament could flesh out for Central and Eastern:</p>

<p>No. 22 Windsor (9-11) at No. 11 Bristol Eastern (11-7), 11/8, 6:00pm</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the Lancers and Rams are in first round action on Tuesday at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of Central/Ledyard takes on the victor of No. 10 North Haven/No. 23 Edwin O. Smith on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A date against No 2 Suffield could be in the cards if the Rams qualify for quarterfinal round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern/Windsor victor gets a match-up against either No. 6 Stratford or No. 27 Wethersfield on Thursday in a second round tilt.</p>
