<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even in the rain, some of our local scholastic lacrosse squads were in action over the past couple days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at some of the action from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central Girls Lacrosse</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Central girls lacrosse team made it two-for-two on Wednesday evening as the Rams smashed Enfield by a 15-3 final in a Central Connecticut Conference confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the home opener for the locals and Central was a big winner against the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, the Rams have outscored the competition 23-7 and in the contest against Enfield, eight different players scored for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all the big guns were out for the Rams, starting with scoring sensation Maddie Secor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secor, notching four goals in Central’s season opening victory at Wolcott, nabbed other four-pack against Enfield to lead the Rams offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rachel Wygant added three goals while Kaylynn LaPointe and Ava Bouchard tallied two goals apiece for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abby Duval and Emma Burciaga also scored for the winning outfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the net, Central keeper Alyah Rodriguez Warren scooped up another win behind a tremendous defensive effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Defense was phenomenal, and Alyah was a brick wall in the goal,” said Central coach Kyle Phelan via Twitter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first match of the season for Enfield (0-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squads will have a quick rematch which will open the month of May for both programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, Central will travel up to Enfield for a CCC showdown on May 2 at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, Central is in action twice on the road before tangling with a familiar opponent in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, Central travels to Wethersfield for a CCC bout at 5:15 p.m. and then on Friday, the Rams are saving up their gas money in a battle against Edwin O. Smith (3:45 p.m.) at Farrell Field Park in Mansfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then on Monday, April 25, it's city series time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern invades the turf at Bristol Central, commencing at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Co-op Boys Lacrosse</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>TOLLAND 8, BRISTOL COOP 6</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Coop battled to the end in its CCC contest against Tolland on Thursday, dropping a tough 8-6 decision to the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match was the debut for the Bristol program (0-1) while Tolland moved to 1-1 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was close throughout but Tolland was able to hold on until the end despite Bristol’s challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Spina led he charge with three goals for the Bristol Coop while Aiden Collins, Ayden Cross, and Dylan Brown each contributed a score over the tough effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max Stavens played well in the net to keep Bristol in it until the final horn.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys continue on the road for its next two bouts as the Bristol program battles at Meriden on Tuesday (5 p.m.) and then Newington (3:45 p.m.) on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol opens at home on Monday, April 18 against Lewis Mills (5 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Eastern Girls Lacrosse Debuts today</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls lacrosse team from Eastern plays for the first time at home, starting at 3:45 p.m. versus Lewis Mills from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s no rest for the weary as the Kingstreeters are in action on Saturday against Rockville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 11 a.m.</p>
