<p>MERIDEN –&nbsp;It’s been two weeks since the Bristol Central cross-country programs hit the courses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The weather has played a bit of havoc with their schedule and when the Rams finally got to hit the course on Tuesday afternoon, it was a hot and muggy day in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the girls and boys programs from the Mum City swept the day over Middletown and host Maloney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The boys from BC flipped Middletown 19-40 while posting a 20-38 victory over Maloney from Hubbard Park in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the winning efforts, Central is now 4-2 overall as one standout from Bristol dominated the race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Patrick Wininger easily won the event, posting a sterling time of 17:08 which was nearly a minute better than the runner up – Maloney’s Griffin DePalma (18:05).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams got an outstanding effort out of freshmen Noah Pellerin, placing third in Meriden with a time of 19:06 while teammate Naythan Pellerin – another tremendous first year competitor – finished in 19:27, good for fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other top finishers for the Rams included Rowan Hennessey (sixth, 19:32), Aiden Georgakopoulos (ninth, 20:15),&nbsp;Nick DiMatteo (12th, 20:24) and Beckham Barse (15th, 21:06).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it was an extremely good day for the Bristol Central boys cross country program in Meriden, putting together a little momentum for the upcoming city series bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BCHS Girls ruled the day as well</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls cross program at Central is now a sterling 5-1 with wins over Middletown and Maloney on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was two squeakers for the Rams as the program won both meets by a combined four points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t get any closer than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central defeated Maloney 27-30 and nabbed a one-point triumph over Middletown (28-29) over another great showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elise Kennedy was the individual winner as the competitor from Middletown crossed the finish line in 21:09.<br>But Central dominated the middle of the race and when Maloney and Middletown’s runners faltered, the Rams were able to make some huge finishes to seal the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another freshmen standout, Central’s&nbsp;Emersyn Mazzei (sixth, 22:56), was the first finisher for the Rams that afternoon while senior Katie Tran (23:04) was one spot behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior&nbsp;Sophia Stark (eighth, 24:09) and&nbsp;sophomore&nbsp;Emma Cavallari (tenth, 24:56) rounded out the top ten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And critical finishes by Johannie Juarez (11th, 26:28) and Ruth Smith (12th, 27:21)&nbsp;helped lead the Rams to the ultimate victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was] another great day for Bristol Central cross country,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk on X. “[The] boys and girls [won] against Maloney and Middletown. So great to be back on the course after being rained out a couple of times.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the Rams host the annual city series meet from Rockwell Park.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This coming&nbsp;Thursday, Bristol Eastern and St. Paul Catholic take on the challenging course at Rockwell in what is going to be a very special event.&nbsp;</p>
