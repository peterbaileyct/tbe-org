<p>BRISTOL - Maybe one day this postseason, the Bristol Eastern volleyball team will have to play on the road in someone else’s gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that scenario won’t be taking place any time soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No. 10 ranked Lancers took care of business in Class L second round play on Thursday against a pesky squad from Windsor, winning in straight sets to post a 3-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By virtue of the victory, Eastern won its 20th match of the season and is now 20-5 - riding a six match postseason winning streak, advancing to the quarterfinals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 25-13, 26-24, and 25-5 as five teams from the Central Connecticut Conference are in the quarterfinal mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern squares off against No. 18 St. Joseph - a 25-22, 25-22, 25-19 upset winner over No. 2 Pomperaug - on Saturday at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 26th ranked Warriors (10-11) did a tremendous job taking advantage of Lancers’ mistakes over the first two sets but the visitors came up empty both times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the third and final set, it was business as usual for Eastern in a 20-point blitzing that sent Windsor out of postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The first set was a little better [but] the second set was similar” to the Torrington game said Eastern coach Stefanie Reay. “And the third set was more how we like to play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allison McGovern ramped up three kills, five digs, and three aces while&nbsp; Amanda Romero bumped up five assists and two digs for Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors sat on set point in the second game but just couldn’t get over the hump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match featured six lead changes and seven ties, most of that coming over the first two sets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just went over to their coaches and said [they] had a fantastic group of girls,” said Reay of Windsor. “They were all over the place on defense. They were really excited. They were smart with the ball. They did a nice job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But all the stars were out for Eastern as Hannah Webber zipped up 16 kills, led the team in aces with six and added three digs in another complete all-around effort.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Bender swung down nine&nbsp;kills while posting five&nbsp;digs and four aces while Alex Shorette collected four&nbsp;digs, four&nbsp;aces, and two kills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alyssa Adorno’s serving was on-point with five aces and Abby Jones dished out 26 assists to lead the Lancers’ offense on the court.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adrianna Reay had a postseason high three kills while Sarah Lacouture, Lilli Lowe, and Emily Valentine all added something to the till.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber sat for a good part of the first set but that was due to an ‘adhesive issue.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that gave other players a chance for a little court time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wanted the to get them some tournament experience,” said Reay about subbing other players in. “Some of it was people [Webber] needing band aids for their fingers…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early tomfooolery in set one saw the Warriors etch up an 8-3 lead with errors and a big kill from Marina Inyatkin fueling the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Webber’s serving took over the game as ace after ace fell on Windsor’s side of the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That jump started a 15-2 Eastern push and quickly, the Kingstreeters went ahead 18-10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bender then flipped in some non-returnable serves, Webber dropped in more kills as the set was a double figure affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting to set point, Eastern watched a bad Windsor serve crash into the net as the upper seed nabbed a 25-13 win to lead the contest one set to none.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In set two, the Warriors ran out to another lead and when Elaina Brathwaite’s serve was not returned, Eastern called for time - trailing 11-6.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers stayed in it and while they trailed deep into the set, Eastern trimmed the deficit one on four different occasions before Shorette got to the service line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three straight aces, the Lancers led 22-20 but the slim cushion could not be sustained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors collected four straight points, getting to 24-22 and was on the cusp of tying the event up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could Windsor drop in one more swing to make it a 1-1 event or would Eastern make a final push to make it a two-set lead?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That stalemate never came to pass as a bad serve started Eastern’s set ending 4-0 burst and when Bender dropped in two unreturnable serves, the Lancers held off the Warriors by a 26-24 final to go ahead 2-0 in the match - looking to close the event over a third and final set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the third game, it was back to business for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adorno’s serves were impossible to return, Webber and Lowe dropped in kills, and just 10 points into the set, Eastern led 9-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think mentality was a lot of what was corrected,” said Reay of the third set. “[And] talking was a lot of what was corrected.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor chopped the deficit to six midway through things but then aces by Jones and a hook up from Lowe to Webber saw the Lancers surge in front, 16-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to end the match, Eastern scored the final seven points as one final swing by Bender gave the Lancers a 25-5 set three win - sweeping the Warriors in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We like to really focus on one point at a time, one game at a time and not look too far in advance,” said Reay. “You can’t climb a mountain in one step so it’s just as important as any other game. We tried to make it not any more important than any other game, but to the seniors it’s ultimately like any game could be their last.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So they’re a little nervous, but they’re also super excited.”</p>
