<p>UNCASVILLE – After a big victory over Southington the previous Saturday, the Bristol Central boys basketball team continued its jaunt through Connecticut’s top venues and on Monday, it was time for a huge rematch from a facility the Rams would love to end their campaign in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And third ranked East Catholic nearly trailed from the onset as Central – the state’s top-ranked team – spun the Eagles by a 74-59 final from Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams improved to 2-0 on the campaign while the Eagles (2-1) lost for the first time this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the second game of The Day of New London Holiday Classic Tournament and the showdown once again highlighted that the Bristol program is truly the best in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once East Catholic fell behind by double-figures, the team could never get back on track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The night belonged to Central senior Donovan Clingan as he put himself in the school’s record books – tallying his 1,033-career rebound, passing his late mother’s standard (1,032) in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Clingan put on another show, collecting 29 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocked shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those totals came through foul trouble as Clingan missed 7:02 minutes of action between the third and fourth periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the rest of the Central team rallied around its 7-foot-2 center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damion Glasper dropped in five three-pointers on his way to 19 points while trio of Carson Rivoira, Julius Powell and Glasper were huge in Clingan’s absence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rivoira/Powell duo combined for eight points when Clingan was on the pine over a stint that saw the Rams actually increase their advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira scored nine points overall while Powell played his best game, adding four points while snaring five huge rebounds to keep the Eagles from making it a single-digit affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steve Alseph was also tremendous, adding a season-high nine points along the way while Victor Rosa did a little of everything for the winners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mason Stokes also scored for Central, just missing on a three-point play late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Reilly (11 points), Luke Reilly (10), Allyn Wright (nine), and Leondre Sanchez (eight) paced a balanced scoring attack for the Eagles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game only saw one lead change and once Glasper busted in back-to-back three-point bombs early in the first tilt, Catholic never again held the edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then when Clingan powered in ten straight points, the Rams led 18-12 with 1:38 to go in the first quarter and took a five-point advantage (19-14) into the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sam Reilly canned a jumper twenty seconds into the second – making it a one possession game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, a critical 10-0 run by Central – with Glasper hitting a lefty lay-up and then canning a three – put the state’s top ranked program ahead by a 29-16 push with 5:11 left in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s offense went into a bit of a lull until intermission but its defensive pressure never relented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catholic’s Rob Elliott put in a miss to chop the deficit to eight late in the half but Clingan made two straight charity tosses and Rosa found Alseph on the baseline for a dagger 3 to end the second period with Central ahead on the scoreboard, 36-23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles never got it to single digits in the second half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan was everywhere to open the third tilt – scoring the team’s first five points – and then found Alseph for another three-point blast and with 4:36 left, Central was up big at 46-30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon after, a double technical saw Clingan pick up his fourth foul, forcing him to the bench, but Rivoira and Powell did well controlling the middle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Clingan watching from the sidelines, Glasper hit a three, Powell put in his own miss, Rivoira canned a free throw and when Glasper ended the third quarter with a blazing 3 at the buzzer, the Eagles trailed 55-40 in what was slowly becoming a blowout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Powell hit another high-percentage hoop to open the fourth frame, Rivoira added a basket and a foul shot and when Alseph flipped in a lay-up, Clingan returned to the game with his team leading 62-44 with 5:18 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then a massive dunk by Clingan made it a twenty-point game ten seconds later, spelling doom and demise for East Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ made it a 24-point push after Rivoira connected on a three-point play and when Clingan rattled the rim one more time, Central’s cushion was 72-48 with 2:39 remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 1:59 left, Clingan seized his 1,033-career rebound, Stokes hit the final basket by the locals and Central grabbed a huge 15-point victory to stay undefeated on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, now on a 17-game winning streak, goes home for the first time on Thursday – squaring off against Middletown (2-1) from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium at 5:30 p.m.</p>
