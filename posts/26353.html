<p>The state of Connecticut continues to honor the police officers from Bristol who gave up the lives in the line of duty last October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference will do so again when the postseason arrives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Each year the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference dedicates its baseball state tournament in honor of an individual closely connected to high school baseball in the state,” according to a recent release by the CIAC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CIAC's 2023 Baseball State Tournament will be dedicated to the memory of Bristol Police Lieutenant Dustin DeMonte.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“DeMonte, a 2005 Middletown High School graduate, was a catcher and pitcher for the Middletown High School baseball team,” the release continued. “Coaches and friends recall Dustin as a quiet leader, who led by example.&nbsp;This season the Middletown High School baseball team has been honoring DeMonte by wearing #51 patches on their jersey sleeves.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The number 51 was DeMonte's uniform number in high school when he suited up for the Blue Dragons, a then member of the Northwest Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year, the CIAC baseball state finals will be played from Palmer Field in Middletown at a facility DeMonte knew extremely well during his playing days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The championship games will commence over the dates of Friday June 9&nbsp;and Saturday June 10.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brief pregame ceremony will be held to formally honor DeMonte and his family on June 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More details of the ceremony will be released by the CIAC at a later date.</p>
