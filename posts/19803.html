<p>NORTH SCITUATE, RI - The top cross country runners from Connecticut and beyond took center stage at the annual 2022 New England Championships on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at the boys event from Ponaganset High School in North Scituate, Rhode Island, Bristol Central’s own Frankie Porrini finished his final scholastic cross country race by making a top-35 showing over soggy and wet conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini placed 34th at the New England Championship event with a time of 16:37.8.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie had a strong senior cross country season,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The field was loaded with several strong runners from Connecticut which included Porrini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Raphael Academy’s Devan Kipyego won the individual championship behind an outstanding time of 15:24.7 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ridgefield’s own Steven Hergenrother - the winner of the CIAC State Open event - was the runner up in 15:37.20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also from the Nutmeg State, Hall’s Isaac Mahler placed sixth overall (15:46) while Rocky Hill’s Brayden Bayek (seventh, 15:47.80) wasn’t far off that mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Fairfield Warde’s Parker Broderick ended up in 22nd place with a time of 16:27.6 which was just 10 seconds better than Porrini’s outstanding finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even as the fall running season has come to a completion to end his scholastic cross country career, Porrini has plenty more to accomplish as indoor track quickly approaches. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are really looking forward to see what he does on the track, indoor and outdoor,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
