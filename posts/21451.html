<p>John A. Rizzi, 84, passed away peacefully surrounded by his family with dignity and grace on Saturday, Dec. 31.&nbsp;Born in Bristol, he was the son of the late Tomasso “Thomas” and Antonia “Antoinette” Rizzi.&nbsp; He lived his life with faith hope and love. He taught us all the value of life, and to enjoy the little things for one day, you will look back and realize they were the big things. </p>

<p>In his younger years he worked in auto body repair. John was a great handyman; he could fix anything. He graduated from Goodwin Tech in New Britain and soon after he enlisted in United States Army serving as a military police officer. He was employed at Wasley products in Plainville for 44 years as the technical director until his retirement. He held many patents for manufacturing process improvements. He designed and created a quick-change mold transfer system with collapsible wheels that made production much more efficient. </p>

<p>He was a member of the golf league and loved to travel. After his wife’s passing, he took over as the master pie chef for the holidays. Being the ever perfectionist, all ingredients were weighed to the nearest gram. Each pie taking longer than the next to bake, thus the 20-hour pie was named. He was kind and loving and the first to lend a hand. He was a great conversationalist and just loved life. He always had a kind word to say to everyone he met. He could always tell when you were down and his favorite saying was “<em>Un giorno alla volta</em>,” "One day at a time."&nbsp; </p>

<p>He met and married the love of his life, the late Patricia Rizzi. They spent 56 years together complimenting each other. He is survived by his favorite daughter, Lisa Baine and her husband Chris of Colchester with whom he made his home. His son Kevin Rizzi and Theresa Calkins, and his most favorite grandson Stephen Govea of Bristol, Chris Pellerin of Bristol, and a host of nieces, nephews and several cousins. He was predeceased by his wife Patricia Rizzi, his son John Rizzi II, and his sister Angela Donovan.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
