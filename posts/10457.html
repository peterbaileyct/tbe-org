<p>Rejeanne Kowalski, 90, of Bristol, left this earth peacefully on New Year’s Eve, Dec. 31. Her last week was spent in joyous Christmas celebration with her loving family. </p>

<p>Rejeanne “Rej” was born in Bristol on Nov. 19, 1931, daughter of the late Agnes and Sam Baillargeon. She lived and attended school in Bristol where she met the late Leonard “Lenny” Kowalski, the love of her life. After high school, Rejeanne attended nursing school in Lynn, Mass., where Lenny would hitchhike to visit her. </p>

<p>After finishing nursing school, Rejeanne returned to Bristol and worked as a pediatric nurse at Bristol Hospital for over 40 years, caring for thousands of children during her time. Rejeanne also served her community through her volunteer work with WIC for many years. </p>

<p>On June 6, 1953, Rejeanne married her childhood sweetheart Lenny and they made their home in Bristol, where they enjoyed entertaining friends and family. Rejeanne was an amazing cook and hostess and would prepare hundreds of pierogies each Christmas to give as gifts to friends and acquaintances. </p>

<p>Lenny and Rej raised two daughters and four grandchildren and spent their summers camping with their family at Hammonasett State Park, where Rejeanne also worked as the beach nurse. Leonard and Rejeanne enjoyed many vacations, traveling across the United States. They continued to travel and spend winters in Florida. </p>

<p>Rejeanne and Lenny were avid bridge and cribbage players, and Rejeanne continued to beat her family badly at cribbage right up until her final day. Rejeanne will be greatly missed by her family and friends, and her family is happy to know that she is now together with her husband Lenny once again.</p>
