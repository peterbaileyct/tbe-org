<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central baseball team is in a bit of a rebuilding mode in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team lost just about all of its pitching due to graduation and a boatload of inexperienced varsity players will have to produce from the get-go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head Coach Bunty Ray, no stranger to rebuilds, has done a tremendous job retooling his squads over the years and it should be interesting to see where this squad goes as the season wears on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick look at the Rams this season:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL BASEBALL</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Bunty Ray (15th season)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 14 seasons as the coach of the Bristol Central baseball program, Ray holds an all-time record of 199-102, one victory away from his 200th career win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2021 season</strong>: 10-7 overall. No. 16 Bristol Central won its first round Class L game against No. 17 Farmington, 5-0, but fell to No. 1 Daniel Hand in second round play (9-3). Hand ended up winning the Class L state championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Losses</strong>: Sean Wininger (P/OF), Michael Lorenzetti (P/OF), Adam Caron (1B), Chris Osuch (C), Dillon Hudson (2B), Roberto Negron-Cruz (3B/P), Matt Beaucar (OF), Jacobi Banks (OF).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>: Frank Spirito (jr, P/3B), Ryan Ring (jr, C), JT Clark (sr, infielder).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 Season Outlook</strong>: Ray tested his squad early in the postseason, playing the likes of St. Paul Catholic, Amity, and Southington who should all be contenders in their respective leagues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams also squared off against Wolcott on a blustery 28-degree day, so a very young squad got a varsity education rather quickly over rough and tumble conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray lost a talented group of seniors, taking just about all of the pitching due to graduation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question is how big will the gains be from several underclassmen as the season progresses?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s a little talent up and down the line-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>JT Clark is the lone senior who has varsity experience and will be one of the leaders of the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s helped the Rams out of jams more than a couple times and he’ll be called upon to do the same this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior, who played at shortstop last season, has home run power, and a slick glove as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clark is one of the featured public-school players from Bristol, while sophomore Frank Spirito IV is also going to be a handful for opponents to deal with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can throw the ball on the hill and might be one of the top pitchers for the program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, he helped throw a no-hitter against Platt last season, striking out eight, helping the squad win its fifth game of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only problem with Spirito pitching is there’s one less trusted glove around the infield for defensive purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was tremendous at third base last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito has all the tools, is tremendous on both sides of the ball, and can hit with power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Newington last season, in Central’s 6-2 win over the squad, Spirito had a tremendous game- going 3-for-4 with a double and three RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Junior Ryan Ring will be catching for the program and brings back plenty of experience behind the plate from last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Ring continues his upward improvement, Central should be able to count on his play at catcher, helping set-up at least half of the team’s battery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Central’s lineup is a bit on the youthful side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray said that there will be several “new guys” manning positions all over the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who is going to step up from the ranks of the underclassmen?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of those lingering questions will be answered along the way against several talented squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players who were on the squad last season that could take the field for Central this year includes seniors Bryan Capezzone and Zach Vanasse - who is coming off a state championship run in boys basketball and could contribute in the outfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other contributions could come from juniors Michael Allen, Jacob Voisine, Jack Bellantuono, Christian Stafford, and Nick Krompegal, along with sophomores Michael McMahon, Anthony Santilli, and Oscar Kuzniar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what freshmen, if any, will be ready for the shine of the bright CCC South lights?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While youth might dominate this team, Ray - outside of the 2018 season - and his programs have always found a path to qualify for postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where will the path lead the Rams in 2022?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch</strong>…Central starts the season on Monday at Maloney (3:45 p.m.) which is always a tough way to start the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that showdown in Meriden, most of the Rams’ early season games are on the road as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those contests include a tough slate of CCC Interdivisional showdowns against Farmington (April 14), Simsbury (April 18), and Avon (April 20).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has several home games to end April with dates against Maloney (April 25), Platt (April 27), and Plainville (April 30) in a special Saturday challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in May, there are a couple big crosstown games that will commence from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central plays Bristol Eastern on Monday, May 2 and again from Muzzy Field on May 23.</p>
