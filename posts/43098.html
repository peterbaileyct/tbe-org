<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, the group moved inside the hall where the names of four soldiers from Bristol were read aloud by members of the Memorial Military Museum. Among those gathered was Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano. Of the men whose names were read, Caminiti knew three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The presentation of the jacket was initiated when members of the Marine Corps League, Hardware City Detachment, 781 from New Britain, was invited by the American Legion Post 2 of Bristol second to Iwo Jima/World War II Veterans Reunion at the Bristol Public Library on March 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Five World War II veterans were present, including Caminiti, a Marine. After meeting Caminiti, the Marine detachment wanted to do something for him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working with myself, Neal Supranovich, American Legion Post 2 historian, the detachment made arrangements to present Caminiti with a United States Marine red satin jacket. This jacket is part of the detachment's undress blues worn by our members at ceremonies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Members of the Marine Corps League Hardware City Detachment discussed participating in more events like this one, since there is not a Marine detachment in Bristol. An open invitation was issued by the detachment to Marines from Bristol to join.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are five Bristol residents who belong to the detachment from New Britain, which also has members from Berlin, Newington, Plainville, and Southington as well as New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of the occasion, once inside the hall, a toast was made in memory of all those on Iwo Jima, followed by a Military toast in honor of Caminiti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conversation inside the hall also included discussions about military training and service covering World War II thru Vietnam, boot camp and how the experience changed over the year.</p>
