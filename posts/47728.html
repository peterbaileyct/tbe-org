<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the evening of the shooting, three Bristol officers, Lt. Dustin DeMonte, Sgt. Alex Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato were dispatched to respond to a call from a home on Redstone Hill Road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While they were at the front door of the home, the shooter approached from the rear with an AR-15-style rifle and Glock 9mm handgun unleashing over 80 rounds and hitting all three officers, confirmed in the report.</p>

<p>Iurato, although hit in the leg, was able to escape further injury and eventually shot and killed the shooter. Both Hamzy and DeMonte were incapacitated and then the subject of several more shots at close range while on the ground, also according to the report. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
