<p>Hello Trainers!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, March 1, kicks off of the latest Pokemon Go event, "World of Wonders," a world-wide family-friendly experience that promises to be for Pokemon “trainers” the highlight of the year. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this column I hope to encourage veteran players and newcomers alike to get out there and connect with locals to bond this Bristol community one Pokémon article at time. Why Bristol? According to Pokemon, there are 15,000 trainers in the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once a week, Thursdays here on The Bristol Edition, you will get an article from me on how to up your game, learn new skills and learn about events from all over the world. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, let me back up. My name is Drew, and this is my inaugural column for Pokemon trainers—yes, Pokemon, for those who aren’t in the know, are creatures that live in a virtual world and trainers collect them as part of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokemon is free to play, and a great way to explore your local area and meet other Pokémon trainers in the world, including right here in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokémon Go is a mobile app designed at motivate players to interact in the real world via augmented reality (AR). The game encourages players to travel to real life destinations to capture and battle Pokémon on their smart devices. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you're a seasoned Pokémon Master or a newcomer to the world of pocket monsters, this latest Pokémon Go event, "World of Wonders" is sure to captivate your imagination and ignite your passion for these beloved creatures. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the main attractions of the month will be the Pokémon Raids. For those newer to the area or to Pokémon Go, here are some of the hottest spots around the city to meet up for raid battles:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Federal Hill green at off Queen Street by St. Joseph Church and the First Congregational Church&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Page Park across from Bristol Eastern High School&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Rockwell Park behind Muzzy Field&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might have seen people in these areas as you are driving around and wonder just what these people are up to. Now, you know. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, these raids start around 6 p.m. Plan accordingly. My experience is that once these raids start, an available spaces fill up. Only 20 players can raid at a time in any raid. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soi, arrive at least 15 minutes early and stock up on “Raid Passes.” These passes allow you to enter raids and allow you the chance to battle and catch these powerful Pokémon at each of these&nbsp;locations. Each of these events requires a “Raid Pass,” and you are allowed one free one each&nbsp;day by spinning a “Gym.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On top of the raids, World of Wonders&nbsp;is introducing new Pokémon to capture. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, attendees can look forward to special guest appearances by Pokémon experts, including professional players, content creators, and even Pikachu himself! &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, grab your Poké Balls, charge up your devices and get ready to embark on an epic journey into the world of Pokémon right here in our city. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you're a die-hard fan or a curious newcomer, the World of Wonders Pokémon Event promises a day of magic, excitement, and endless possibilities. We'll see you there!

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
