<p>BRISTOL - The postseason has arrived for cross country and that means both the boys and girls programs at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern are looking forward to the Central Connecticut Conference bout this afternoon – pitting all the CCC schools from the four divisions in a big race at Wickham Park in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the biggest threat to the boys team from Central could be the team across the city at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The first thing we’ll have to do is hold the Bristol Eastern boys off,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk of the CCC meet. “We don’t want to split the division with them, so we’ll definitely be focusing on that. The CCC is such a great conference that it will give our guys, our higher-level kids, a great opportunity to really get out in the thick of the competition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And one of the featured runners in all the CCC with be taking the course for the last time in conference action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Frankie Porrini has been putting in the work all year round and has a big chance to make a top-five showing at the CCC’s showcase event and beyond this month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah, [I have] pretty big” expectations said Porrini about the postseason. “We want to win the Class Ls. That’s the goal this year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after the All-American posted a 17:16 to become a two-time winner of the annual Bristol city series race, he’s primed and ready to run on a very familiar course in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central program is very familiar with the course which is a big advantage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central runs Wickham Park early and often every season and expect Porrini, along with fellow senior Chris Roy, Patrick Wininger, Lance Archibald, Braydan Dwyer and the rest of the cross country crew to shine a week before the Class L extravaganza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We love Wickham’s course,” said Stafford-Kirk. “We like the hill. It’s a nice challenge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the recent 40th Wickham Invite, Porrini placed sixth (16:31) in what turned out to be a big CCC field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy placed 46th (17:47) while Wininger came in at 75th overall (18:14).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a strong team and the CCC event will be a great sampling for what should be a very competitive Class L title meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It will just be a good chance for everybody to see where they stand and it’s the end of the season for some kids,” said Stafford-Kirk of the CCCs. “It’s kind of bittersweet. It’s kind of a kickstart for the guys who are going to compete at the Class L [championship] and hopefully, beyond that and it’s the end for some other kids.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the girls over at Central, the duo of Sophia Stark and Katie Tran – an ever-improving junior twosome – will lead the Rams at the CCCs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, for the Rams, Lynae Lewis, Emma Cavallari, and Johannie Juarez could help the program make a splash at the annual meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just over a month, the regular season came and went at Central and while the cross country campaign wasn’t a sprint, it certainly didn’t end up being a marathon either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It happens fast,” said Stafford-Kirk of the cross country season. “I told the kids in August it will be October before we know it and we’ll be talking about championship season and here we are.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And though both programs are small in numbers, Stafford-Kirk expects both the boys and girls squads to make a little noise this postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told the kids we are small, but we are mighty,” said Stafford-Kirk. “So that’s what we’re sticking with.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3 p.m. for the girls and 3:45 p.m. for the boys at Wickham Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…The CCC meet features the top ranked squad in the third CT High School Coaches’ XC Poll of the season. Hall was ranked first with 159 votes (15 of 16 first place votes)…The boys will hit the course at Wickham at the conclusion of the girls race.</p>
