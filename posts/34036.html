<p>The showdown, from Pistol Creek Park in Berlin, saw the girls split the affair while the boys - a possible CCC South frontrunner if everything works out - were able to sweep the competition.</p>

<p>“[The] girls lost to a very strong Berlin team, but pulled together to take down Maloney,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski. “Kaelyn Gonzalez led the way finishing 3rd overall. She was backed by Calliope Gallagher and Rita Gao, who both put in very strong efforts.”&nbsp;</p>
