<p>“This is our third year hosting a summer concert,” said Brian’s Angels executive director Pat Stebbins, “and they’re always a blast. I’m so grateful to everyone involved in Angelfest and to all of our volunteers; we couldn’t do this without them.”</p>

<p>The fundraising event will open with a performance from stand-up comedian Linda Belt. The New Jersey native has performed at comedy festivals throughout the United States and Canada, including the Detroit Comedy Festival, Long Island Comedy Festival and Women in Comedy Festival.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Comedy is new to the fundraiser this year,” said event planner Michael Cansdale. “I think a lot of people are excited about that.”</p>

<p>“Three years ago, we were feeding 20-25 people,” said Stebbins. “Today we fed 59. We’ve had days where we’ve seen 65 people come through our doors this summer. They’re soaked, exhausted and they need our help.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to offering hot and cold meals, Brian’s Angels provides clients with clothing, shelter opportunities, bus passes for CTFastrak, vouchers for Grime Busters Laundromat and more. </p>

<p>Local favorites Jeff Summa and the Roasters are returning to the stage for their fifth Brian’s Angels benefit concert. The six-piece jam band based out of Litchfield are known for their original songs that feature a unique fusion of psychedelic rock and blues. Winners of the 2019 CTNow Best of Hartford Readers Poll, Someone You Can X-Ray, will take the stage at 7:15 p.m. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jeff Summa has been our savior when it comes to the concerts.” said Stebbins. “He put together the lineup for the benefit over the winter and he got Someone You Can X-Ray to join this concert. I’m so happy that both bands are coming back. I’m excited, it’s going to be a great show.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jeff Summa and the Roasters have played a bunch of the Brian’s Angels concerts and they’re always a hit with the audience,” said Mike Cansdale. Jeff’s a really good guy. Someone You Can X-Ray played at the December concert and they were great. We’re glad to have them back.”</p>

<p>The benefit concert will conclude with a performance from nationally renowned guitarist Jeff Pevar. The 2016 NY Blues Hall of Fame inductee has toured the world with numerous musicians, including David Crosby, Joe Cocker and Phil Lesh and Friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
