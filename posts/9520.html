<p>Once scholastic football comes to a conclusion, the state of Connecticut will be moving straight into to the winter season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means plenty of sports played in heated gymnasiums and the return of scholastic wrestling after the cancellation of the sport in 2020-21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the rules about what students and spectators should expect this winter have just been released by the CIAC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CIAC has collaborated closely with the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Connecticut State Medical Society Sports Medicine Committee to develop its winter sports guidance,” according to a release from the CIAC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the featured aspects of the CIAC Winter Sports Guidance includes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Alignment with all DPH guidance for youth and interscholastic sports throughout Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Permitting vaccinated student-athletes to participate in basketball, hockey, and track running events without a mask after school is released for the winter holiday break will be at the discretion of each local school district.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*All CIAC winter sports will play a full schedule, including multi-team events and interstate competition, and culminate in CIAC State Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CIAC is grateful for the collaborative efforts by the entire interscholastic athletic community in engaging more than 35,000 student-athletes during the fall 2021 season,” said the release. “We look forward to providing safe experiences for our member school student-athletes in the upcoming winter season.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These guidelines will go into effect starting on November 29 and could change depending on the state of the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The CIAC emphasizes that this plan is fluid and in a perpetual state of evaluation,” according to the release. “COVID health metrics and data in Connecticut will continue to be closely monitored and the appropriateness of holding youth sport and/or interscholastic athletic contests can change at any time. The CIAC will continue to consult with our stakeholders and will adjust offerings as appropriate should the health metrics direct that action.”</p>

<p>Scholastic sports held this winter include boys and girls basketball, gymnastics, ice hockey, boys and girls indoor track, boys swimming, wrestling, and cheer/dance.</p>
