<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls basketball team always makes it a habit in qualifying for postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And whether it’s the Central Connecticut Conference Tournament or the CIAC Class L fray, the Lancers are usually part of the postseason mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the last time Eastern did not qualify for any kind of postseason play was back in 1994-95 but have been playing hoop in March every year since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before March Madness infects the scholastic scene, the CCC starts its annual tournament on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 16-team format will see the Lancers (8-11 overall), ranked 15th overall, square off against No. 2 Newington in first round play from the Richard E. Rogalski Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is at 6 p.m. in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the GameTimeCT Top 10 Girls Basketball Poll this week, Newington was the top rated squad in all the state and is 19-1 entering the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team will also be the top ranked Class L program in the state tournament fray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This won’t be the first time Eastern and Newington squared off against one another this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on February 5, the Lancers gave the Newington a real run for its money – dropping a tough 55-41 decision in the only meeting between the squads this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that showdown, Eastern’s Ciara Collins knocked in 25 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in that game, Janessa Gonzalez added eight points and a team-high 13 rebounds while Taigan Parent nabbed four points and blocked a couple shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that road game, Eastern had a tremendous day from the free throw line, going an impressive 22-for-22 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lilly Ferguson, one of the top players from the Central Connecticut area, led Newington with 20 points while Bella Cucuta added 15.</p>
