<p>MIDDLETOWN - Continuing its playoff push, the Bristol Eastern baseball team won on the road – scooping up a 7-4 decision over Middletown from Palmer Field on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big one for the Lancers (5-8), turning away a very good Blue Dragons program (9-5).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this time around, pitcher Mike Roalf went the distance for Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roalf pitched a complete game, allowing eight hits, four runs (two earned), struck out four and walked only one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown scored single runs over the first, third, fourth, and seventh frames but could not cobble together enough offense to derail Roalf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, defense fueled the Lancers as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole Latko played well at shortstop as did Preston Guarda over at first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot Norris and Ryan Maglio were sharp while Conor McCormick in centerfield and Connor Cyr in right field made timely throw-ins for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Ben D'Amato nabbed three singles and drove in two runs to lead the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown scored an unearned run in the bottom of the first to take a 1-0 lead but Eastern had a quick response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers put up a pair of runs on the board in the second, third, and fourth frames to seize control of the game at 6-2.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, walks to Rio Fernandez and McCormick, followed by a perfect bunt from Cyr for a base hit, loaded things up with no outs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored a run on a double play ball and added another via a Middletown miscue to nab a 2-1 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third, the Lancers scored two more runs to seize a 4-1 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guarda led off, reaching base on an infield error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio and D'Amato followed with singles, scoring Guarda, and McCormick’s base hit brought home Maglio as Eastern went up by three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middletown scored a run in the third to trim the deficit to 4-2 as a leadoff walk came around to score off a sacrifice fly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Eastern responded in the top of the fourth with two additional runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, Guarda reached again on an error and Maglio walked to put two on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato's single to right plated Guarda and Maglio scored on a wild pitch to propel the Lancers to a 6-2 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons notched a run in the fourth on an Eastern blunder but maintained the lead, this time at 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's final run came in the top of the seventh with D'Amato dropping in a one-out single to left-centerfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pinch runner Gabe White eventually stole second and scored on Jose Feliciano's long double to left that made it a 7-3 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Dragons added a run late but, in the end, the Lancers got to the pay window with a three-run triumph from Palmer Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking for its third straight win, Eastern plays Plainville in a CCC South bout on Friday night from Muzzy Field at 6:30 p.m.</p>
