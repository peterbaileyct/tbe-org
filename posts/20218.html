<p>In mid-November, the Bristol Edition sent an email to all the successful candidates in our state legislative delegation. It was a simple request asking what they hoped to accomplish and what their priorities will be heading into the new session in January. We actually re-sent the same request to any elected legislator who did not reply to our first email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We sent a request to State Sen. Henri Martin (R-31) and State Representatives Cara Pavalock-D'Amato (R-77), Joe Hoxha (R-78) and Mary Fortier (D-79).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is exactly what the request was asking:</p>

<h3>Congratulations on your recent election. As the new legislative session approaches, the Bristol Edition is asking our local representatives some basic questions about the upcoming term.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. What are the priorities that the legislature needs to address?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2.What initiatives do you plan to undertake?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. What is your position on the early voting proposal?&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. It is a Budget year. What are some things you would like to see added to the budget or cut from the budget?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We received a reply from Representives Fortier and Hoxha. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sen. Martin and Rep. Pavalock-D'Amato did not reply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The first reply was from Rep. Fortier </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as the priorities the legislature needs to address, I think inflation is the top one. While the legislature cannot stop inflation, they can continue to do things that help residents cope with the increased prices of essential projects. The gas tax holiday was a prime example, and the upcoming special session to extend that, illustrates the priority. I think we should also continue looking at ways we can find other tax relief. One example is some of the exclusions for the tax relief on pensions that was enacted recently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as initiatives, I don’t have any specific plans in mind. I still don’t know what committees I will be assigned. The Democratic leadership now has 98 members to make assignments for and while that is a good problem, it may take a little longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I enthusiastically support the early voting amendment. Absentee voting was the issue I received the most calls about during this election season. We have large numbers of seniors in Bristol and sometimes their health gives them problems intermittently and they would prefer to vote on “a good day.” All of us deserve options so that anyone who is able has the opportunity to vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is almost certain that I will not be on the committees that draft the budget as a freshman legislator so I may not have the input you might hope I have, but something I would advocate for would be more money directed to childcare programs, to broaden the subsidies available and increase the wages for these essential workers.</p>

<p>Mary Fortier, D-79</p>

<h3>This is the reply from Rep. Hoxha</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am certainly looking to weed out waste, fraud and abuse in the social welfare system and work with anyone whether it is with members of my own caucus or the other side of the isle to do this. Also I would like to remove burdensome fees and regulations that small businesses have to deal with like business filing fees.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also need to codify tougher minimum sentencing laws for violent criminals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We should go back to emphasizing STEM in the public school curriculum and less social experiments. Certainly fighting to make sure CRT (Critical Race Theory) never makes its way into the school system.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I voted against early voting, but I didn’t think it inherently provides an advantage or disadvantage to either Republicans or Democrats. I think it’s just a new dynamic in terms of your voting system that both parties are going to need to adapt to when campaigning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
