<p>From staff reports<br>A fire ripped through an Ipswitch Road home around 8 a.m on Thursday, prompting a full response from the Bristol fire department and support from the Wolcott volunteer fire department which brought a tanker engine to augment the BFD water supply since the area does not have hydrants. </p>

<p>No injuries were reported as the elderly homeowner made it out of the house as the structure became fully engulfed.</p>
