<p>Hundreds of community members celebrated a day of frightful family fun at the inaugural Halloween Spooktacular event held at BAIMS. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unseasonably warm 80-degree weather and sunny skies provided the perfect conditions for the outdoor extravaganza. Hosted by the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Department, the event featured arts entertainment and food that embraced the Halloween spirit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children and adults alike took this opportunity to transform themselves into their favorite Halloween characters. Attendees donned a diverse array of costumes from caped superheroes to dancing skeletons, swashbuckling pirates to enchanting witches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Young attendees toting buckets and pillowcases embarked on a trick-or-treating adventure around the BAIMS Field. Kids received candy from over two dozen artisan vendors and local organizations who had set up booths around the grounds. </p>

<p>An array of culinary delights was available from several local food trucks and restaurants, including Dem Boyz Grill &amp; Catering, Cafe Real, Ye Olde New England Boiled Potatoes, Prime and Meraki.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the sun went down, the festivities continued under the glow of the full Hunter's Moon. A DJ played spooky favorites like Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” while Lights on Rosewood delighted guests with an enthralling display of Halloween lights and decorations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artistically inclined guests had the opportunity to showcase their talents in the pumpkin carving contest where contestants had the opportunity to win prizes for their efforts. Kids lined up to have their faces painted and guests had the opportunity to have their caricatures done.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For adult guests seeking a dose of cult classic nostalgia, a screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" with live shadowcast by RKO Army was held in the Rockwell Theater. This marked the second official Downtown Live event held in the newly renovated venue.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next Downtown Live event will be "Scenes: A Billy Joel Experience held" on Saturday, Nov. 18, at the Rockwell Theater. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
