<p>Antoinette (Pagliarulo) Ziogas, 96, passed away peacefully at the Pines on Monday, Oct. 16. Toni, as she was known to her friends, was born and raised in Bristol. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She married her childhood sweetheart, James Ziogas, upon his military discharge in 1946. The two went on to raise six sons in a two-bedroom apartment on Melrose Street, and each son went on to raise their own families in Bristol as well. </p>

<p>She was a pillar in the lives of her sons, and she made her home on Melrose Street the heart of the Ziogas families, who hold dearly to the memory of Sunday mornings, Christmas Eves, and many other moments spent in her love and hospitality there.</p>

<p>She was a devoted member of St. Anthony Church; her best years of retirement being spent organizing and attending bingo at the church. She can fondly be remembered sitting in the stands of Muzzy Field to attend baseball games and was always a dedicated fan of her sons’ sports.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A child of the Depression, she knew what “going without” really meant. She worked hard, never complained and was always grateful. She is loved by family and friends and will be deeply missed.</p>

<p>Antoinette leaves six sons; Greg and Connie, Chris and Helen, James and Linda, John and Lisa, Mark and Carolyn, and Michael and Caren. She is survived by her one remaining sibling, Tina Zuk, her youngest sister. She also leaves 15 grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
