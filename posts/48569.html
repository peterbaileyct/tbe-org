<p>Come Sunday morning, the Republican Convention will have wound down and the campaigns will be gearing up for more electioneering. Here in the city, we have our own campaign in District 3 to consider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come July 30, Bristol residents in that particular district will head to the sole polling place at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School on Memorial Boulevard to cast their votes. Typically, residents would also be voting at Green-Hills and Bristol Eastern. Not this time. Note: early voting opens on July 24 at city hall. </p>

<p>For listening, there is the podcast, "Capitalisn't." This particular episode, entitled "The Costs of a Phone-Based Childhood, with Jonathan Haidt," features the author of the bestselling "The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing An Epidemic of Mental Illness." Sounds like a lot to take in, and, I suppose, it is, but it's a necessary subject, and one we all need to become more familiar with. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Haidt, a New York University psychologist argues "that today's childhoods spent under the influence of smartphones and overprotective parenting has let to the reported explosion in cases of teenage anxiety and depression," according to the podcast notes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Haidt not only diagnoses the problem but provides solutions. Luigi Zingales and Bethany McLean, the hosts, interview Haidt but also conduct a post-interview debriefing in which they discuss the solutions and their feasibility.

<p>For reading, there is plenty of commentary about the presidential race, including that of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, that of the Democrats deliberations about whether Biden will leave the presidential race and that of general analysis of all things political.</p>

<p>For my part, I am getting through Tommy Orange's novel, "Wandering Stars." Orange, a Native American, writes about Native Americans in contemporary settings. His first novel, "There, There," was one of the New York Times 2018 10 best books. This one picks up where the first leaves off.  </p>

<p>Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
