<h3>The return of Screwy Louie</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Screwy Louie stopped by the newsroom of the TBE and made his way to our corner and the staff of the GMB. He plopped down his bag, announced he wished to discuss Super Bowl history, and then dropped this gem on us:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 1972 Miami Dolphins went undefeated at 17-0 and are the greatest team of all time, However, as great as they were, the 72 Dolphins only won one Super Bowl. Think about that while you drink your iced coffee and eat what looks to be bagels. Can I have one?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uhhh, okay. Thank you Screwy.</p>

<h3>Karate chop</h3>

<p>That ends this chapter of the GMB. Don’t judge a book by its cover, Bristol. See ya, next week.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
