<p>A local man was arrested last week for possession of narcotics with intent to sell and risk of injury to a child by local police working with an investigative team from New Haven, the Bristol Police Department announced in a release yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thomas Faraci was arrested Thursday, Sept. 12, when Bristol Police Department Narcotic Enforcement Team (NET) working with members of the DEA New Haven Office executed a search and seizure warrant at 47 Atkins Ave. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Investigators found fentanyl, crack cocaine, a digital scale, ammunition and a facsimile handgun inside the residence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The arrest was the result of an investigation that began in August, when Bristol NET received complaints that Faraci was conducting narcotics sales out of the Atkins Avenue address.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After investigating, NET obtained two arrest warrants. Faraci is being held on a $275,000 bond.</p>

<p>In the release, the Bristol Police extend their thanks to the DEA New Haven Office and the community for assisting with this investigation. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"NET is determined to combat illegal drug use and trafficking within the City of Bristol and the public is encouraged to contact us with any information related to illegal drug sales," the release states.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
