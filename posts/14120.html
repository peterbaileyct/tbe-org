<h3>Laura Minor has written the following letter reminding us that our local food banks can use our help this summer.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For many, many years now, I have written this letter to remind my neighbors about helping out our local agencies who feed those in need. If you have a garden and have extra produce, please consider donating some of it to the agencies below which will accept it. My garden is doing well so far…if I don’t get tomato blight or borer worms in the zucchini, I should be able to contribute a lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are more folks than ever who are in need. If you don't have a garden, please note that many of our wonderful local social service organizations need other items and gift cards. They can all use cash donations as well. We are #bristolallheart. I know that you will be generous.</p>
