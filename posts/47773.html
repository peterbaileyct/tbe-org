<p>Bristol hosted Naugatuck Thursday night at Muzzy Field and once again the bats were quiet as Naugatuck opened up a 4-0 lead after four innings and held on for a 4-2 victory over the local nine.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol was only able to garner four hits, all singles, on the night. They did work seven walks off Naugatuckâ€™s pitchers, but the big hit never materialized for Bristol despite many chances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jose Feliciano was the only Bristol batter with two hits. Caleb Molinsky and Jedric Sutula had a hit apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky was the hard-luck loser on the mound, giving up all four opponent runs, but only one of those runs was earned.  Brian Grabowski came on in the fifth and pitched three shutout innings in a strong relief performance.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol now sits in fourth place in Zone 1 with a record of 5-6.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next game will be at Memorial Field in Simsbury against NCL at noon on Saturday.</p>
