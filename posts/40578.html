<p>Wheeler Health has surpassed its expanded Bristol fundraising goal of $555,000, raising $606,000 in gifts and pledges one and a half years ahead of schedule for its new Bristol health center and administrative headquarters at One Hope Street in downtown, the organization announced in a release yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The expanded goal of $555,000 was set in 2023—raised from the original goal of $500,000—in honor of Wheeler’s 55<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than 500 individual donors contributed to the campaign, through outright gifts and pledges; participation in the 38th Annual Wheeler Golf Classic, which netted approximately $78,000; or by sponsoring a named brick at One Hope Street. Approximately 20 individuals or organizations contributed more than $10,000 in gifts or pledges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The named brick campaign is on track to have at least 100 bricks in place when the facility opens later in 2024, with a goal of 125. Bricks are available for purchase through March 1, on Wheeler’s website. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
