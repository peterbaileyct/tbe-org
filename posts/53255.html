<p><strong>Pat Murrone</strong>, 95</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patricia "Pat" Murrone recently passed away at age 95. A kind and wonderful lady, she was the widow of Tom Murrone, a man who gave a lot to Bristol through his civic mindedness. They were a great couple who had four children, seven grandchildren.</p>

<p><strong>'Dick' Fitz</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His real name is Robert Fitz, but we've all gotten to know the WWII Navy Veteran as "Dick." How did he get the nickname? Well, he had a young niece who read "Dick and Jane" books all of the time. With this, the niece started calling her uncle Dick.</p>

<p>I have four different cold cereals to choose from each morning. I tell my friend Lorette which one I'd like each day, and she brings it out to the couch while I wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Sunday I asked for Frosted Flakes, and when she brought them out and put the bowl on my lap, a TV ad for the cereal came on at the very same time. And, yes, they were great. That was a surprise double Tony the Tiger moment.</p>

<p><strong>'The Full Monty'</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of my health team's projects, those of family and friends, is getting me home care. I currently have a bad knee and can't stand in the bathtub. So, my daughter Jessica had a woman come to the house to interview me regarding helping me shower.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The price is about $25, plus she would get a bonus to see "The Full Monty!"</p>

<p><strong>The Yankees and all</strong></p>

<p>My favorite baseball player was Mickey Mantle. Somewhere I have that photo of "Mick" with our Tom Shopay when he was with the "Bronx Bombers."Â  Tom is a good friend of mine and he calls here from Florida at times. Sad to say, a sad 2024 World Series.</p>

<p><strong>'Trick or treat'</strong></p>

<p>I was on the living room couch on Halloween when this big kid showed up at the door....it was Hank Lodge to my surprise! Hank was in the area, so stopped in to say hello. Much appreciated. Hank was wearing a Denver Broncos cap and shirt that his grandson had gotten for him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hank also mentioned that his grandson purchased it for him. He also mentioned that his son, Scott, will be honored this fall by the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame with the Julie Larese - Tramps Award. Well deserved!</p>
