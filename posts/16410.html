<p>In 2007, Bristol Central football standout Aaron Hernandez competed collegiately for the Florida Gators, making three starts as a freshman, and eventually played in 40 games over three seasons - making 111 receptions for 1,382 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And we, back in little old Bristol, were excited to see him achieve at such a high level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Hernandez’s junior campaign, he was named a First-Team All-American by the Associated Press and won the John Mackey Award - a designation bestowed upon the nation’s most outstanding tight end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, we were excited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He entered the 2010 NFL Draft and was a top-three tight end prospect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez was eventually picked in the fourth round, the 113th pick overall, by the New England Patriots and played right up the road at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the citizens from the Mum City were over the moon by the local selection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez made his profession debut against the Cincinnati Bengals - scooping in a huge 45-yard reception on September 12, 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there was even more excitement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In only his second season as a pro, the Patriots played in Super Bowl XLVI on February 5, 2012, and Hernandez posted a tremendous game (eight passes, 67 yards) - highlighted by a 12-yard touchdown reception but New England loss to the New York Giants, 21-17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The excitement of watching Hernandez, someone from Bristol playing in the biggest game of any sport, was off the chain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then played one more season of ball before everything fell apart on the youngster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernandez was charged with first-degree murder on June 26, 2013, and all that excitement was instantly squashed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, another warrior from the ranks of the Bristol Central football program is about to bring that excitement back to Bristol all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enter Rosa</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a standout career for the Rams, Victor Rosa is about to make his debut for the University of Connecticut on Saturday as the Huskies battle Utah State in a major test for the Huskies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa, a 5-foot-9, 198 freshmen, had a tremendous career at Central and a standout senior campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He helped lead Central back to the postseason with an 9-2 record, playing quarterback, running back, and everything head coach Jeff Papazian asked of him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Rosa delivered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, he scooped up 2,728 yards on 279 carries that included 41 TDs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa was a blur in motion on the field at BCHS over his three scholastic seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, that excitement has hit the UCONN campus at Storrs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa will get a chance to help the football program grow from the ground floor up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies won a single game in 2021 but with new coach Jim Mora at the helm, the hope is that a new attitude, a hungry young core - along with plenty of excitement - will see the program improve by leaps and bounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It won’t be easy as UCONN is slated to finish towards the bottom of the NCAA Division I rankings according to all the experts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa should see some time at running back and perhaps on special teams as the dynamo is eagerly waiting for his chance to strut his stuff on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, as the games and years go by, all that excitement will be coming back for Rosa’s fans and supporters in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best part is that student athletes like Rosa (and Donovan Clingan for the men’s basketball program at UCONN) get to begin their collegiate journeys in the state, playing for local institutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rosa’s first collegiate game commences on Saturday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the lowdown on Saturday’s UCONN game as the Huskies hit the road in Utah:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>UCONN at Utah State</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Where</strong>: Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium in Logan, Utah&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When: </strong>4 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How to Watch: </strong>Fox Sports 1 on television; UConn Sports Network from Learfield - ESPN 97.9 on the radio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Records from 2021: </strong>UCONN was 1-11 overall, defeating Yale last season for its only victory; Utah State went a sterling 11-3 last year, won the Mountain West Title, and defeated Oregon State (24-13) in the Jimmy Kimmel LA Bowl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What to expect: </strong>UCONN will probably take its lumps in the 2022 opener but there will be drastic improvement as the season pans out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>UCONN’s new coach: </strong>Under first year head coach Jim Mora, there’s plenty of optimism. In six seasons at UCLA, Mora went to four bowl games and was 46-30 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>All-Time: </strong>The Huskies are 0-1 against the Aggies since 2001.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who to watch: </strong>In Bristol, all eyes will be on Victor Rosa as he makes his collegiate debut for the UCONN football program. </p>
