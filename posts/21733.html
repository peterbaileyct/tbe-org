<p>This unique candy shop features “gourmet handmade creations for all," including those with dietary restrictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The base of all my candy is peanut butter, chocolate, organic crisp brown rice and marshmallows,” said Karen Masi, owner of It!, located on East Main Street in Forestville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Then we cut them into squares and dip them in milk white, dark and peanut butter chocolate. And we dip them into potato chips, pretzels, sugar cones, Oreos, caramel and all kinds of fun stuff.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The candy is made in original (sugar), sugar free, gluten free, vegan, gluten free vegan and by order only, peanut free.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masi, whose pixie cut red hair frames her face, talked passionately about her work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former restaurant owner explained how she started making candy for her customers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said she sold her “marshmallow madness” at a local grinder shop called Hollywood Heroes, which no longer exists. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I always thought about marketing it and one thing led to another, and the first Christmas I sold 292 dozen out of my house,” she continued. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's been 10 years that I've been doing this, so now I'm in Family Roots on Riverside Avenue in Bristol, I'm in Bagel Plus Deli, and I just got into the Big Y in West Hartford.”</p>

<p>“It is exciting, I just delivered 72 dozen peanut butter bombs because I'm marketing my peanut butter bombs here,” she proudly announces.</p>

<p>Anyone walking into this unique candy shop, would be hard-pressed not to notice the eclectic décor that blends well with the aroma of every sweet flavor that teases the senses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mannequin whom she named Marilyn, sits quietly in a chair near the front door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I decorate for every season, so now I have to transfer into Valentine's Day so I leave everything red and white,” she continues. “Get rid of Christmas trees, Santa Clauses, then I'll fill in with some Valentine's Day stuff.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the season changes into spring, Masi said she will dive right into decorating by putting her rainbow back up with flowers, while making her shop all bright and cheerful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What sets her apart from other candy businesses is the fact that Masi caters to all different types of dietary needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My son is vegan and I'm a vegetarian, so a lot of places were restricted because they don't cater to people that have dietary needs,” said Masi.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A lot of people sometimes think it's a nuisance, but this is why this is my whole thing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masi said she had a customer that was allergic to everything, but she found chocolate that was free of every possible allergen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It's great because people have children with dietary restrictions, adults have dietary restrictions,” she continued. “Mostly it was based on children because children always want what their brother and sister has.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her candy is an alternative for anyone with dietary restrictions, diabetes or dairy allergies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I do punch cards so with every $10 they spend, they get a punch and when they get 10 punches like all these people did, those are all the free dozens that I've given away,” said Masi, pointing to all the cards lining her wall.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
