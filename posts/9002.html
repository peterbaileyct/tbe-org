<p>The American Volleyball Coaches Association recently released its 2021 AVCA Best and Brightest Award Second Team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And two players from the outstanding squad at Bristol Eastern earned the prestigious award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Alex Shorette and Abby Jones earned a spot on the team, two of six Connecticut players to make the national list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To earn the award, the student-athlete had to achieve a 3.3 Unweighted GPA or 3.8 Weighted GPA or above during her junior year of high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nyssa Park from Conard in West Hartford, Nataly Moravec of the Hopkins School and Meghan Brennan and Margaret Ferguson from Pomperaug were all honored along with Shorette and Jones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, the duo of Shorette and Jones haven’t missed a beat and continued to excel in both the gymnasium and in the classroom over on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette has 73 kills to date for the Lancers along with 51 aces, 108 digs and 19 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones, the tremendous setter for the Eastern program, has 546 assists in 2021 which is one of the best totals in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s also tallied 105 digs and served up 42 aces as the Lancers are 13-5 overall and 8-0 in CCC South play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all, 977 student-athletes received the 2021 AVCA Best and Brightest Award.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>That group of standouts are all seniors now but the players were honored for their outstanding work in the classroom and on the court during their junior campaign.&nbsp;</p>
