<p>Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz joined Bristol leadership and legislatures at the Carousel Museum on Friday to promote the Connecticut Summer at the Museum program. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is an incredible opportunity for Connecticut families to visit some of the gems around the state, like this beautiful carousel museum,” said Bysiewicz. “It’s an opportunity to visit 120 beautiful attractions that range from Mystic Seaport, Norwalk Aquarium, the New Britain Museum of Art. There are so many great places to visit.”</p>

<p>The state program permits Connecticut children aged 18 and under and one accompanying adult to receive free admission to museums across the state during the summer months. More than 120 museums including art museums, historic sites, science centers, arboretums and zoos statewide are participating in the program that runs through Sept. 4.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re honored to be part of this program,” said Carousel Museum executive director Morgan Urgo. “We know that when you share the joy of museums with our young children, they grow up to be lifelong learners; they’re hungry for that education. It’s so wonderful to have whole generations of Connecticut children being exposed to museums at no cost.”</p>

<p>The Carousel Museum has been a popular destination for carousel enthusiasts for more than 30 years. In addition to a fully operational carousel, the museum is home to hundreds of pieces of art and memorabilia, as well as a workshop where historic carousel pieces are restored. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The museum offers a variety of events and mission-driven programs for visitors of all ages. Within the newly designated cultural district, Bristol has four additional museums that provide enrichment and culture through art, history and education. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We also have the American Clock Museum in addition to the Historical Society and the Military Museum as well located in that facility and the Imagine Nation Center,” said State Sen. Henri Martin. “We have much here in Bristol to be thankful for.”</p>

<p>The Connecticut Summer at the Museum program was established by Gov. Ned Lamont in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Developed to provide children with enrichment during the summer months, the program is financed through a $10 million investment in federal COVID-19 recovery funding Connecticut received from the American Rescue Plan Act.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Connecticut Summer at the Museum program also provides an opportunity for tourism that could positively benefit downtown development.</p>

<p>"This program benefits our families, and it benefits our communities,” stated State Rep. Mary Fortier (D-79). “As we restore this street that the museum is on and we restore our downtown, it brings great benefit to us all.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of the things that I have felt and seen in Bristol is that there is this excitement about what’s happening in town,” said Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano. “People are looking for urban renewal, downtown revitalization. Come check things out. I think people will be very excited to see what’s happening in and around here. We have a lot of great things to offer.”</p>

<p>Caggiano added that there are some Bristol residents who have never visited the city’s museums and this program would provide them with a great opportunity. </p>

<p><br>Rep. Joe Hoxha (R-78) echoed the positivity that he believes the Connecticut Summer at the Museum program will bring to the city and spoke of happy Bristol museum memories.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This place brings back memories,” said Hoxha. “The last time I was here was in 2003 on a class field trip. I haven’t been back since, but I assure you that I will be making more visits.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
