<p>The 33rd Annual High School Wrestling Nationals took place from the Virginia Beach Sports Center from Virginia Beach over the weekend of March 25-27 and Bristol Eastern’s Ella Nichols was back on the mats once again.</p>

<p>The High School Nationals is one of the premier wrestling tournaments in the country as “wrestlers from across the country compete to become All-Americans” according to their website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event featured nine weight classes and Nichols was tremendous at 144 - going a perfect 5-0 against some steady competition.&nbsp;</p>
