<p>It was only a matter of time before Bristol Central softball pitching sensation Sophia Torreso was going to make a decision on her collegiate future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And frankly, she had plenty of choices on her docket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso, because of her outstanding abilities both on the field and in the classroom, had plenty of interest from Ivy League programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other NCAA Division I programs were inquiring about her services as well, including George Washington University.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the senior chucker made her choice as she will be linking up with the Colonials for the 2024 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am so excited to announce my commitment to further my academic and athletic career at The George Washington University,” said Torreso via Twitter. “Thank you to all my coaches, teammates, friends, and family for the love and support, and for helping me get to where I am today. Thank you to Coach Schoony and Coach Fister for this opportunity. I am so blessed, and excited for the journey ahead.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The GW softball program is a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, coached by Chrissy Schoonmaker and assistant Teresa Sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program had an outstanding 2022 campaign, going 36-17 overall and was a stellar 21-3 in A10 play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Congratulations, Sophia,” said Bristol Central’s Twitter feed. “REALLY excited to see what you do with this hard earned opportunity! GW is getting a high-quality student-athlete!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of outstanding, that was exactly the word to describe Torreso’s junior campaign as she helped lead the Rams to the 2022 Class LL Championship game against Southington and it wouldn’t be any real surprise if Torreso and company made it back to the title round - perhaps winning it all to end the spring scholastic season of 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was a sterling 22-5 overall last year and if nemesis Southington, the Class LL champs, weren’t in the way in the title finale this spring, who knows where the Rams would have ended up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso and fellow pitcher Alex Sciarretto were an incredible 1-2 punch for Central and that extremely talented duo will be back for one final epic season of play come next spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just over 70 innings of action last year, Torreso racked up 145 strikeouts and carried an ERA of just 1.66 going into the championship tilt against Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once her offensive game catches up to her outstanding pithing prowess, GW will be getting a dual threat player who will elevate both the Colonials softball program and the school itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso also plays for the RI Thunder 18u National team and is a full-time softball player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She comes from a long line of athletes from the Ziogas family tree who went on to compete collegiately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mother Ginny did it all for Bristol Eastern over three sports, bringing her basketball talents to Pace University - standing out for the institute in New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uncle Todd, who could have played basketball at the Division I level, was a three-sport star in soccer, baseball, and basketball at Eastern as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He followed his sister to Pace, establishing several statistical records by the completion of his career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after the scholastic season is complete for Torreso, it will be time for the senior standout from Bristol Central to travel down to Washington D.C. to commence her collegiate journey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cannot wait to officially be in the Buff and Blue,” said Torreso.</p>
