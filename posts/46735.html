<p>Superintendent, Dr. Joshua Medeiros, of the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services stood among kids, alongside a representative of the company responsible for designing the new playground at Seymour Park, several members of both the city council and Board of Park Commissioners and the mayor for the ribbon cutting of the new playground yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project is part of a master plan to improve the neighborhood parks, Medeiros said. He said it was supported by a board of park commissioners, city council and board of finance members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The design of the playground came from Kompan, a playground design company, represented at the ribbon cutting by Summer Berube, the territory manager.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I just know it’s [the park] gonna be loved for many years,” Berube said.</p>

<p>The Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano said Bristol should be called "Park City."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We [the city] should be called the Park City here in Bristol,” he said. “With all the improvements over the years, we certainly rival other cities that use that [title].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano said that he was proud to call the neighborhood his and to have raised his children there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he had received some positive comments about the updated park already.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
