<p>SOUTH HADLEY, MA – The New England Collegiate Baseball League recently announced several of its 2023 regular season award winners and one of those honors went to the Bristol Blues’ own Jagger Duquette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The undefeated Jagger was named the 2023 Robin Roberts Starter of the Year for the NECBL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Robin Roberts Starter of the Year is given to the best overall starter during the regular season,” according to a release from the league on Monday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The right handed pitcher, the senior from Wagner College and a former Bristol Eastern High School standout, helped the Blues to a late dash to the postseason, a ride that ended in the finals of the Fay Vincet, Sr. Cup Championship.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette went a perfect 4-0 this past season, starting nine games – throwing an inning during the 2023 NECBL All-Star Game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was 3-0 in regular season play, picking up an additional victory during a complete game gem in the playoffs against Valley on August 1 (5-0 win, seven strikeouts).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette threw nearly 50 innings overall this season, posting a slick 1.63 ERA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just in the regular season alone, he carried a 1.37 ERA, striking out 31 batters over 32.2 innings of work. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He walked just seven batters while posting four scoreless appearances along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette allowed fewer than five hits in all but one outing this year with that game being a six-hitter in Bristol’s 6-2 win over Danbury on July 9. He won that game over a five strikeout, zero walk performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he had a couple appearances that ended up as no-decisions in close one-run losses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Keene on June 16 and North Adams on June 24, the chucker from Bristol picked up six Ks over each contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other award winners included Danbury’s Anthony Steele (The Joe Nathan Reliever of the Year award) and Sanford’s Logan Poteet (The 2023 NECBL Batting Champion).</p>
