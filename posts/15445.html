<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Blues have more than a few pitching studs on its roster in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a team ERA of 3.25 -- a really good tally -- the squad managed to seize victories in 31 out of its first 43 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of pitching leaders, Bristol has a ton of talented chuckers at its disposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a quick look at some of those standouts suiting up for the Blues this year:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Colin McVeigh</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into Saturday’s night showdown against Danbury, McVeigh had compiled a 4-1 ledger over 36 innings of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s allowed seven runs for a slick 1.73 ERA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McVeigh carries a 3.80-to-1.00 strikeout-to-walk ratio and has only allowed 10 free passes in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s started five games, pitching in 10 overall and proved can pitch as a starter of come out of the dugout in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 38 strikeouts and four victories lead the Blue this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McVeigh has gone 3-1 over the month of July which included a four-hit, zero run, and three strikeouts stint over six strong innings in Bristol’s 8-1 victory over North Adams back on July 14.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, he also saw a little time in the NECBL All-Star game last week, throwing a third of an inning that included a strikeout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s been pitching extremely well as of late and should see time on the hill when the playoffs roll around to open the month of August.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents are batting .228 against the Blues this season and against McVeigh, those same batters are hitting just .181 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Luke Garofalo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s saves leader has put together an eventful season as the reliever carries a tremendous ERA of 0.73.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Garofalo scooped up 17 strikeouts in his 12.1 innings of action, allowing just one earned run over those encounters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Garofalo is 2-0 on the campaign and is tied for third on the Blues in victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s handed out just three walks and 13 hits with an opponent’s batting average of .250 which is just a little above the team average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Batters have tallied only six hits off of Garofalo -- another All-Star -- and walked just two batters over July.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Jagger Duquette</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Eastern standout has been an excellent arm for the Blues’ program, chucking nearly 33 innings this season over nine games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette started six of his nine appearances, giving up just five earned runs -- leading to an extremely impressive 1.37 ERA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s yielded just two doubles, posted a slick 27-to-8 strikeout to walk ratio, and allowed only 24 hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Duquette has not earned a decision over regular season play but opponents are batting less than .200 against the Blues’ pitcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In July, he’s walked just four batters -- most of that coming over the second half of the month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
