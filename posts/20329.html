<p>Ronald C Messier died peacefully the morning of Nov. 23, five days short of his 76th birthday. He was born to Robert L. Messier and Mildred (Murphy) Messier. He graduated from Bristol Central High School and completed his bachelor’s degree in finance at CCSU which led him to a career later retiring from Bristol Hospital as Finance Director.</p>

<p>He was married for 53 years to Pamela (Morin) Messier, spending a lifetime in Bristol where they raised three boys and countless dogs.&nbsp;Ronald was a former National Guardsmen, and throughout life was member of the Bristol City Council, Board of Finance, Board of Education and an active member of the Bristol Historical Society and Elk’s Club.</p>

<p>Known for his quick wit, contagious sense of humor and impeccable detail, Ronald often referenced himself with a handshake as “Class Cutest 1964.” Whether at the bakery, grocery checkout, Page Park walking his poodles, one of the local garages or even the DMV, Ronald never failed to bring happiness to whomever was willing to listen.&nbsp;If you were without a pen, needed a car, shoes, a tie, or even batteries for your flashlight, with a smile on his face Ron would gladly accommodate. Ronald never stopped giving. In true testament to his character, Ronald was an organ donor, generous to the end. He truly had "A Wonderful Life."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
