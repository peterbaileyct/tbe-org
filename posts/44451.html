<p>Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services has begun soliciting funds that it will direct towards non-lethal methods of managing the geese population on city property, especially Veterans Memorial Boulevard and Park, according to a release from the department late Monday afternoon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Proceeds from the annual Dinner on the Diamond, BPRYCS noted, would be directed to non-lethal solutions. The dinner is being held Saturday, May 11, on the infield at Muzzy Field. Tickets are available <a href="http://BristolRec.com">here</a>. </p>

<p>The Goose Management Plan would be one of the first community driven projects to receive funding from the Friends of Bristol Parks and Recreation Fund, according to the release.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An outpouring of community members showed up for the Board of Park Commissioners meeting this past Wednesday, April 17. Others wrote letters, emailed and phoned the mayor's office. The vast majority supported non-lethal methods to control the geese population in the city, rather than one that included a geese roundup and euthanization of the geese.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response, Board of Park Commissioners decided that further research into non-lethal approaches is a next step after the meeting, states the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The funds, according to the release, will support habitat modifications, lawn treatments, scare devices, clean-up equipment and public education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, donations can also be made directly to the Friends of Bristol Parks and Recreation Fund through the Main Street Community Foundation website at <a href="http://www.mainstreetfoundation.org/friends-bristol-parks-and recreation-fund">www.mainstreetfoundation.org/friends-bristol-parks-and recreation-fund</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Goose Management Plan introduced at the April meeting of the Board of Park Commissioners will be reviewed and adopted in the coming months. Community members are reminded not to feed the geese.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
