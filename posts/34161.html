<p>The Bristol Republican Town Committee celebrated the grand opening of their 2023 headquarters on Friday night with a meet-and-greet of the committee-endorsed candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s been a good night,” said Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano. “We’ve had a good turnout so far; everyone is welcome here.”</p>

<p>Located in the heart of Bristol at 188 Main St., the RTC headquarters was bustling with activity throughout the evening. Many citizens left with lawn signs to show their support for their preferred candidates after asking questions regarding issues of importance.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>City Councilor Erick Rosengren stated that connecting with constituents was one of his favorite aspects of being a city councilor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This, meeting people, it’s one of the best things that I get to do as a city councilor,”&nbsp;said Rosengren.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosengren is seeking reelection for a second term, alongside fellow District 1 City Councilor Sebastian Panioto.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As visitors entered the newly inaugurated headquarters, they were greeted with a warm reception and a meticulously prepared selection of food and refreshments. Several community members sat down with candidates to engage in meaningful conversations.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>City Councilor Sue Tyler, who is seeking reelection alongside fellow District 2 City Councilor Jackie Olsen, smiled as she looked around the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I love Bristol,” said Tyler, “that's why I ran for city council 2 years ago and that's why I'm running again."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several RTC members and political candidates voiced their support for their fellow party members. District 3 City Councilors Cheryl Thibeault and Andrew Howe spoke of their mutual respect and gratitude for their collaborative efforts over the past two years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cheryl is great," said Howe. “She works very hard for District 3. I couldn’t ask to work with a better person.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thibeault echoed his sentiment, emphasizing their shared passion for teamwork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re a team,” added Thibeault. “We love what we do, and we love doing it together.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In addition to the mayoral and city council candidates, community members had the opportunity to engage with Board of Education candidates Kristen Giantonio, Russ Anderson, Lori Osenkowski and Jen Van Gorder, as well as Board of Assessment Appeals candidate Greg Klimek.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
