<p>Changes to the timing of every traffic light on South Street, from Wolcott Street to Mountain Road and the intersection of Middle Street are intended to improve traffic conditions, said a release from the Bristol Police Dept.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The intention, according to the release, is to help with increased traffic on South Street, eliminating the need to use other smaller roadways, such as East Road and Ridge Road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The changes to the timing of streetlights on South Street consist of adjusting the timing of every light, increasing green lights so that traffic can travel to and from both Rt. 69 and Rt. 229 in an expedited manner with fewer red lights.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
