<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – There’s a youth movement going on for the girls basketball team at Bristol Eastern this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if those first-year scholastic players can contribute to the already established, veteran core, this squad is going to be all the better for it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several willing and able freshmen could back up the likes of Vanessa Drury, Amanda Noel, Lauren Ayotte, Leah Roy and Autumn Udoh on the hardwood.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And any contributions by that freshmen class will go a long way this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to look for as the Kingstreeters hit the hardwood in 2023-24:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN GIRLS BASKETBALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Tony Floyd (44th season)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Season’s Record</strong>: 11-12 overall in 2022-23 (No. 19 Bristol Eastern lost to eventual Class L champion Edwin O. Smith in the second round play, 58-38). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 43 seasons at Bristol Eastern, Floyd is 605-348 overall. His teams earned state titles in 1983, 1987, 1990 and 1991. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Subtractions</strong>: Taigan Parent (guard, St. Josephs – for now). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Players</strong>: Vanessa Drury (sr, guard), Lauren Ayotte (sr, forward), Leah Roy (jr, guard/forward), Amanda Noel (jr, forward), Autumn Udoh (so, forward), Jayle Evins-Mosley (so, injured), Savannah Drury (fr, guard), Cassie Sward (fr, guard/forward), Alaina Joy (fr, guard), Natalia Vye (fr, guard), Gracie Browne (jr, guard), Jenna Azab (fr, guard/forward).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Size and experience at the forward and point guard positions. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Youth, completely new bench. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Eastern will be successful</strong>:&nbsp;Eastern has a talented crew up front with size that will excel at rebounding and shot blocking. The Lancers have a solid starting five that can compete with any squad in the CCC South. How fast the freshmen class gets up to speed with varsity basketball is the ultimate question – one that was partially answered against Manchester on Tuesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Relevant Fact:&nbsp;</strong>Udoh was a fierce freshman competitor last season, posting a double-double (11.7 points and 10.3 rebounds-per-game) along with four blocked shots-per-game. With an added year of seasoning, is there a better underclassman in the CCC South than Udoh? &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Another&nbsp;Relevant&nbsp;Fact:&nbsp;</strong>Only a handful of scholastic girl coaches have 600 or more wins. One of those mentors is Tony Floyd who started coaching at BEHS in 1979 and has amassed some tremendous teams and garnered numerous accolades along the way. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: This season, the Kingstreeters could incorporate four or so first year players into the mix, joining a good crew at forward and experienced weapons at guard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern won’t go anywhere unless that freshmen brigade can produce and so far, the results have been extremely positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a good preseason,” said Floyd. “I came at [the freshmen and] they responded. They are very good listeners.”&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all starts with five critical returners, hoping to build on numerous positives from last season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh posted nearly 12 points-per-game, gobbling up double-figures in rebounds while snatching 2.5 steals and blocking several shots over a huge freshmen campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her poise out of the gate was simply phenomenal in 2022-23, dropping in video game like numbers and when she sets her feet, her jumper falls through the hoop repeatedly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern will lean on her when the pressure is at its greatest and the shot clock is running out of time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noel could be the squad’s most improved player this season, looking like a completely different athlete at times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season’s sixth man averaged just under three points and three rebounds-per-game but those numbers are about to leap off the page.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has a nose for the ball, can finish around the hoop, likes to run and jump and will block a shot every once so often.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noel’s growth will be another huge deal for the young squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve improved a bunch from last year,” said Floyd of Udoh and Noel. “They’re able to score, they’re finishing shots and they know where to go.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also up front is Lauren Ayotte, one of the leaders on the squad and a player that does all the little things extremely well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She started all but one game last season, providing a couple points and 3.7 rebounds-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ayotte has been playing varsity hoop since her sophomore year and knows the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She accepts her role on the court and while other players may get the credit for points and rebounds, the senior is helping those athletes get in position to make those contributions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At guard, senior Vanessa Drury (8.2 points, 3.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 3.2 steals-per-game) has been a three-year contributor as well and her playmaking is a big deal to the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She can shoot the ball with range, dribble in and out of traffic and has the ability to finish at the hoop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury’s quick hands results in more than a few steals a game and her offense, especially in transition, will help this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack-of-all-trades Leah Roy (2.6 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.2 steals-per-game) is another critical component to Eastern’s success.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior hustles on the court the entire thirty-two minutes and doesn’t have any problem mixing it up in the paint.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if her shot is falling consistently, Roy is tough to top.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the bench, it’s truly going to be a nearly all-freshmen platoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore center Jayle Evins-Mosley is injured, will miss the season and that means it’s next man up.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enter a talented freshmen class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of first year players, the grouping of Savannah Drury, Cassie Sward and Alaina Joy will provide more than just spot minutes on the court for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The younger Drury is a good option at guard, displaying similar traits as her sister Vanessa while Sward has a nose for the ball and will shoot from deep.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joy can also score and rebound a bit and if that trio of athletes can provide a spark, an occasional start or a crucial substitution each and every night, the Lancers are going to have something this season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The young kids, we’ve spent a lot of time on execution,” said Floyd. “And we’re not trying to throw a lot of stuff at them. But they listen to details and they do a great job of moving the ball.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern lost a big chunk of the junior varsity squad from last season that would have spelled the current starting five but now, those freshmen have been thrown into the fire – hitting the floor running.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, that group has responded.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“All of them have bought into what we’re doing,” said Floyd. “Hopefully we can keep getting better and better at this.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Floyd didn’t expect that kind of poise out of his first year players so soon but if this team can show ability in small chunks and then put it all together later down the road, the program will be all the better for it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Youth being served isn’t all that bad on this Eastern squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Games to watch this season</strong>: The Kingstreeters will take on Berlin the day before New Years Eve on Saturday, December 30 (1 p.m.) in what should be a very good bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest Catholic comes to town on January 26 and don’t forget the annual Eastern/Central clashes on January 16 and February 12 in what will be two no-miss events.</p>
