<p>Good morning, Bristol!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Folks, welcome to Labor Day. A day to honor workers and there is no better way to spend the day away from work than with family and friends. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With it being Labor Day and all, please be careful out there. We've entered the silly season of politics: more signs, opinions, and name-calling. Plus, more promises made, more promises broken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is there a bigger lie in politics than, "I will work across the aisle?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, place your bets, place your bets! Whose political signs will be stolen first, and who will be the first to complain about it? Cara? Greg Hahn? Van Gorder? Fortier? Rasmussen-Tuller or Unopposed?</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
