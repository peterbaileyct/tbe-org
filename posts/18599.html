<p>The Office of the Inspector General for the State of Connecticut in cooperation with several other state offices investigating Wednesday nightâ€™s fatal shooting of two Bristol police officers released the body camera video from that night Sunday.</p>

<p>In the video, entitled "Bristol Final," which was released from the Office of the Inspector General, the footage begins with the injured Bristol Police Officer Alec Iurato circling back to the street, after having been shot in the leg. He calls for backup before positioning himself by his patrol car and takes a single shot that fatally wounds the shooter. A woman's voice can be heard screaming throughout the 2:15 minute video, and in one stark moment, a spate of gunfire cuts through the air.</p>

<p>Text accompanying the video states that three officers, Sgt. Dustin Demonte, Officer Alex Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato responded to a 911 call, allegedly made by Nicholas Brutcher, the shooter. They went to the side door of the residence where they encountered the shooter's brother and asked him to step outside. As he did, the shooter approached from the rear, unleashing 80 rounds of ammunition, striking the three officers, fatally wounding two. Iurato was shot in the leg. He called for backup and circled back to the patrol car.</p>

<p>Text included on the video states that the investigation involves an "officer-involved shooting of NIcholas Brutcher on October 12, 2022, at 310 Redstone Hill Road, Bristol, CT" and concludes "Although some details of the investigation remain to be determined, it is evident from the evidence collected so far that Officer Iurato's use of deadly force was justifed."</p>
