<p>Elijah has resided in Connecticut since he was 5 years old.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah was a man of many talents and trades. He recently was thrilled to start working for a construction company and was planning on getting his CDL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of Elijahs many passions was training at the gym, he was enthusiastic about being physically fit and when he wasn’t with his girlfriend Hailey, he spent his free time at the gym.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah was a big teddy bear. He was quick to hug everyone he came in contact with. He always left a conversation with an “I love you.” His smile was contagious, and his presence was magical. When he put his mind to something, he was determined to make it happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah loved being in nature. He enjoyed fishing, boating and hiking. He was also quite the chef with a big appetite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijahs love for his family was immense and his nephews T.J. and Baker meant the world to him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides his parents, Marcia and Barry, Elijah is survived by his sister Alex Vallier and her partner Tylor Johnson, Brother Zachary Vallier and his partner Bree Atwood, Stepfather Rick Angelillo and stepbrother Jake Angelillo, nephews Tylor and Baker, his girlfriend of many years, Hailey Popovich, paternal grandparents Richard and Marie Vallier, and his many loving aunts, uncles, cousins and friends.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah is predeceased by his maternal grandparents Salvatore and Mary Commendatore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calling hours will be held at O’Brien Funeral Home, 24 Lincoln Ave, Bristol, on Wednesday, April 26, from 3 p.m. until a service that will begin at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>In lieu of flowers, the family asks you to consider making donations to a Go Fund Me page that will go to his two nephews’ future college funds: &nbsp; <a href="https://gofund.me/045bf17c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gofund.me/045bf17c</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
