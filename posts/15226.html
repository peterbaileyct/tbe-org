<p>Dreams do come true. That is what two Bristol residents, Wesley “Wes” Norris and his wife Lyndsie, are finding. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dream goes back to CATS Gymnastics established in Cheshire in the mid-1980s. The Norrises, introduced to CATS in the 1990s, purchased the highly successful business in mid-2019 and have continued a tradition that now includes their daughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris, 51, worked at the gym for three years the mid-90s while at college. After graduating, he joined the United States Coast Guard and moved to Florida.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I came back to CATS for another three years in the early 2000s,” said Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2017, the Norrises returned to CATS Gymnastics, never forgetting their vision of one day owning the gym.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We bought the gym in August of 2019,” said Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In February 2020, a flood forced the gym to close its doors for two weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After reopening its doors for only three weeks, the gym was forced to close for another three months because of the pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the summer of 2020, the gym reopened once again, and the business has been thriving ever since, according Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In November 2021, CATS expanded by taking over the space next door, increasing the gym space by about 40 percent, he said. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We didn’t compete last season because of Covid,” said Norris. “This season, we had great success with some levels winning every meet they went to as a team.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With multiple State Champions, the CATS Xcel Bronze team won the State Championship team title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“None of them having ever competed before,” said Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CATS has about 65 kids on their competitive team and close&nbsp;to 400 in the overall program, according to Norris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, Norris said, the gym has more than 75 athletes who received scholarships, while also producing several National Team members.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris said the recreational class program grows every session. Classes fill up so quickly that parents actually set their alarms, he said, often staying up until midnight to sign-up for classes, as soon as they become available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Norrises, it has become a family business to be proud of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My daughter Everley, (she’s eight) has been a gym rat since about 18-months-old, many times in the gym, five-six days a week, “ said Norris. “Because of the hectic gym school and Kindergarten being full days, we decided to home school&nbsp;her right before the pandemic hit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Norris, the soon-to-be third grader had an incredible season, placing first in all but one of her meets this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the world of gymnastics, most eight-year-olds are new to gymnastics, just starting recreational classes,” said Norris. “At age eight, Everley is performing skills that many teenagers are just beginning to learn.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said his daughter is on a path towards college gymnastics if she chooses to do so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She actually worked out with the Southern Connecticut State University gymnastics&nbsp;team last year, garnering quite a few cheers and comments from the college gymnasts,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sport of gymnastics has a reputation for being hard on young girls, especially at such a high level of competitive&nbsp;athleticism, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lyndsie and I decided when we took over, that our philosophy&nbsp;would be that they are kids first,” said Norris. &nbsp;“We don’t yell and scream at them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Norrises have high expectations of their athletes; they believe in achievement through positive reinforcement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If you look at our success in the last three years, you can see that it works,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With five years left on their lease, Norris said if they continue to grow as they have, they will need to look for more space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the foreseeable future, CATS will stay in Cheshire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have established roots in the town and one of our major goals is to be a large part of the community,” said Norris. “We have participated in parades, fundraisers and a walk for MS since taking ownership.” &nbsp;</p>
