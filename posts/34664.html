<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls soccer team won its first CCC South encounter of the campaign, spinning rival Platt by a 5-0 final from Alumni Field on Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers, according to winning coach Scott Redman, “set the tone early” and were able to cruise to the win after a solid first forty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 4-0 with 18 minutes remaining in the first period and never let up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kate Patterson played a gritty game, notching a match-high two goals to lead the offensive attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her final score of the game made it a 4-0 contest, a lead that lasted into intermission, before another goal by Megan Krok ended the scoring on the afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shannon Philippon had a major impact on the pitch, collecting a goal and a couple assists to help the Kingstreeters get to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scoring started just five minutes in as Emma Stavens, Patterson and Philippon combined on a goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Patterson jammed the shot home, it was a 1-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven minutes later, it was Stavens’ turn to blast a ball into the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Philippon gained the end line and angle, crossed it to Stavens who blasted it in to put the home team up by two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Philippon scored one in a reversal of positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Stavens beat the defender down the end line and slotted a pass to Philippon who blasted it in” for a goal said Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was already ahead in the match by a 3-0 score just 19 minutes into the bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to end the first half scoring, Patterson was at it again for a second goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Megan Krok wins a ball in the middle, plays a beautiful ball over the top to Patterson who finished on the breakaway,” said Redman as Eastern was in front 4-0 at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, with 28 minutes to go, Krok notched her goal to propel the Lancers to an imposing 5-0 cushion</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Selina Kielb wins the ball on the sideline, plays to Stavens in the middle who switches it beautifully to Maria Perrone on the right side,” said Redman about the set up. “Perrone [kicked] a precise cross to Krok who buries it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keeper Hailey Beebe saved three shots as the defense held the fort against a Panthers squad that has a little speed and ability on the pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[The] defense played great against numerous talented players including [Platt’s] Love Thompson and Michelle Rugerio and shut them down,” said Redman. “Beebe [played well] in goal but AJ Joy, Maggie Kozikowski, Corinne Sutula, Cara Lusitani and Haylee Harrison” all played a good defensive match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers look to build upon their two-game winning streak against a very good program in Berlin on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6 p.m. from Sage Park in Berlin.</p>
