<p>BRISTOL - Non-conference rematches that happen to fall during state tournament play are rare in scholastic sports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But here we are, on the cusp of the second round in the Class L bracket for girls hoop, and that means Bristol Central is back to work, under the bright lights of the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the eighth rated squad has a huge battle on tap on Thursday in what could turn into a revenge game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (17-6) has already established a school record for wins in a season, accomplished when they won their first state tournament game on Monday, and tonight the Rams go for victory No. 18 against North Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nighthawks (16-5), ranked ninth in the Class L fray, have some confidence coming into the game as the program defeated the Rams by a 57-30 final back on January 21 in a non-conference tilt in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And frankly, North Haven has some momentum coming into the showdown from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nighthawks defeated No. 24 Maloney 57-28 in first round play from North Haven on Monday, leading 30-10 out the gate and never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Balanced scoring saw Ava Halovatch flip in team-high 14 points while Julia Ball notched 13 for the Nighthawks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams defeated No. 25 Wethersfield 57-35 last Monday afternoon and look to defend home turf against North Haven on Thursday night in what should be a good battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has been enjoying a little postseason success as of late and the squad hopes to continue that trend against the Nighthawks and move into the quarterfinal round with a win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Scoring Check</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, the Central squad doesn’t have a 10.0 point-per-game scorer but that’s not all that unusual in scholastic hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that makes the Rams a bit dangerous offensively as four players average at least 7.5 points-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leilani Jackson leads the Central crew with a 9.8 points-per-game scoring average while Ariana Rivera (9.1 ppg) isn’t that far behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicole Riemer (9.09 ppg) is a fraction off Rivera’s total, moving up the scoring ranks as the postseason progresses, while Brooke Watson (8.95 ppg) rounds out a very good scoring bunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nighthawks must pay attention to everyone offensively and if Jackson and crew are left open, shots are going to fall for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
