<p>EAST HARTFORD - At the 90th Annual Greater Hartford Invite on Saturday, the Bristol Eastern outdoor boys track and field squad had a tremendous showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a couple school records fell by the wayside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carter Harris helped the program establish two new standards as the 800 meters and 4x800 relay team broke previous Eastern records.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris snared a new standard in the 800, finishing in 2:02.21 - beating the old record of 2:02.85, established by Pat Plourde in 2010, over a tremendous showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That effort was good for third place at the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 4x800, the combination of Logan Crowley, Jack Mulcunry, Dominic Tartarelli, and Harris finished in 8:16.24 - easily breaking the old record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team record was 8:21.0, originally established by Plourde, joined by Christian Sinshi, Joe Bak, and Gregg Chase for the original 4x800 record back in 2009.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, off that sterling time, won the relay event in East Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the personal record front, sophomore Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum did extremely well in the triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His leap of 42 feet was his best ever mark in the challenging event, earning third place off his efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program from Bristol Central also competed at the Greater Hartford Invite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Rams, Victor Rosa nabbed third place in the 100 meters (11.38 seconds), Noah Conard took seventh in the 400 (52.74 seconds), and Frankie Porrini made a second place finish in the 3200 - ending the race in 9:48.88.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa also did well in the javelin, placing eighth with a toss of 122 feet, three inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Eastern finished in 12th place (22.5 points) while Central took 17th (18) at the Greater Hartford.</p>
