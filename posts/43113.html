<p>Memorial Day is a day for remembering those lost at war, a somber occasion, unlike Veterans Day which is more celebratory, said the local commander of American Legion Post 209.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There's not a right or wrong way to celebrate," Post 209 commander Brian Avery qualified, but said that the Forestville Memorial Day Parade is more about what you emphasize--and it is the sacrifices of those who came before us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Forestville Village Memorial Day Parade, sponsored by Post 209, will be held Sunday, May 26, at 2 p.m. with a rain date of Monday, May 27, at 2 p.m. </p>

<p>"Memorial Day is not a celebration," he said. "We are not there to have picnics and baseball games."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year Post 209 is making a special effort to reach out to all those families who have lost a loved one at war to participate in and be recognized as part of the parade, to sit on a float or in a car and have their names read as they pass the viewing stand at the beginning of the parade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, the Post is reaching out to youth groups, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our point of view is we want to teach the next generation about the sacrifices of the previous generation," he said. "The only way to do that is to get them involved. Many don't know the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans' Day."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A number of youth organizations who have participated in the past are the Bristol Boys and Girls Club, Little League, soccer clubs and high schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We try to involve as many youth organizations in the Forestville Memorial Parade as we can," Avery said, "because our thinking is if we can get the young generation to participate, they will understand what Memorial Day is all about."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Every event we do," Avery said, "is a teaching and learning event."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families of those lost at war or youth groups can contact Brian Avery, parade chairperson and Commander of the American Legion Post 209, via email at americanlegionpost209ct@gmail.com.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is especially important for families to register so that they can be recognized officially during the parade, Avery said. After receiving an email, Avery will send a registration form to be completed before as part of the parade planning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Memorial Day is a day to memorialize those who have made the ultimate sacrifice," he said.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
