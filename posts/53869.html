<p>To kick off its season of giving and spread cheer early, Lake Compounce has already donated 400 tickets to the Boys &amp; Girls Club. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These tickets will help create unforgettable memories for the children and families the club serves within the Bristol community and beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the ticket donation, this year, Lake Compounce has launched a warm clothing drive aimed at providing essential winter clothing items to local youth. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The park will be taking donations during its first weekend of Holiday Lights from Friday, November 29 through Sunday, December 1. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those that donate to the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Bristol will receive a free single day ticket to enjoy the park during the 2025 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The park continues its partnership with the Boys &amp; Girls Club with another initiative. From Friday, December 13 through Sunday, December 15, Lake Compounce and Pepsi will join forces for the first ever Stuff-A-Pepsi-Truck event at the park. Both organizations will be accepting unwrapped toys throughout the weekend. These toys will go directly to the communities and families that are members of the Boys &amp; Girls Club here in the local Bristol area. Those that donate will also receive a free single day ticket to the 2025 season. </p>

<p>“We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to Lake Compounce for the park’s generosity to our members during the holiday season,” said Director of Resource Development, Jon Rulkowski. “We strive to provide enriching experiences that foster growth, learning, and joy among our youth. Now, many of our members will be able to enjoy a day of adventure and fun that they may not have had the chance to experience otherwise.”</p>
