<p>10 Main Cafe &amp; Deli opened just after Labor Day in 2022 and continues to grow, often with lines out the door at lunch time, according to owner Rodney Voisine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even then, the cafe, on the bottom floor of the 10 Main St. building across from Walgreens on the corner of South and Main streets, is still relatively unknown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was there on Wednesday, around 2 p.m., I overhead two new customers ask how long the cafe had been opened and how come they hadn't heard of it before discovering it that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voisine and staffers Tara Costello and Ian Wishart serve breakfast and lunch Monday thru Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and on Saturday from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. A feature is daily homemade soups and products from other Bristol businesses, such as coffee from Cafe Real and rolls and buns from Harvest Bakery.</p>

<p>Desserts are a hodge-podge of in store products and those purchased from Bristol businesses, again from Harvest, but also bagels from New York City vendors.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the homemade chicken orzo soup was sold out, and I had a cup of pea soup with chunks of ham, which was terrific. The sandwich I choose was the Bristol Fire, comprised of hot capicola, pepper jack cheese, roasted peppers, fresh jalapeno, onion and marinara sauce on a Harvest roll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. 8 on the Signature Breakfast Sandwiches menu, is called the Sir Charles, which is named for regular customer Charlie Radcliff, who just happened to stop in. The Sir Charles, served on a buttered toasted Harvest hard roll, is two extra-large eggs and lobster meat topped with remoulade sauce.</p>

<p>Among the breakfast sandwiches are The Rockwell and Da'Italian, along with the Peak 10 Fitness' Health Choice. There are plenty of others.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
