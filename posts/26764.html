<p>MERIDEN - At the 2023 CCC Girls Outdoor Track and Field Championships on Tuesday from Maloney High School in Meriden, the two public schools from Bristol went back in forth during a very competitive event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney (144 points) won the meet while Plainville (126 points) was the runner up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers came in third place with 90 points while the Rams, just finishing behind Eastern, was a hair off with 86.5 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The girls placed third in the conference and finished the season with a record of 10-4," said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters had four athletes earn CCC South All-Conference honors off the final results of the CCC showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman star Kaelyn Gonzalez came away with several big victories over multiple events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was the runner-up in both the 1600 meters (5:34.9) and 3200 (11:56.25).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then she made up part of the 4x800 meter relay foursome, taking second place overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of&nbsp;Cecelia Gilbert, Kadence Meyer, Lauren Ayotte, and Gonzalez&nbsp;roped up a time of 10:22.42.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonzalez is a bit of a bulldog who has a bright future as a scholastic athlete over at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for both teams, Eastern's&nbsp;Princess Priscilla Dilone&nbsp;placed third in the 100 meters (13.27 seconds) while Central's Lynae Lewis was the runner-up in the 400 meters (1:01.08).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Julia Armington came in third place (1:01.96) as the Bristol programs did well in the 400 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central's Sophia Stark showed grit over multiple events, taking third place in the 800 meters (2:25.80) while the 4x400 meter relay program of Stark, Gabriela Drewniak, Francesca Amara, and Lynae Lewis won in 4:13.00.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayiah Reinhard&nbsp;ended up in third place at the pole vault event for the Rams, making an attempt of seven feet, six inches, while a Central/Eastern duo went 2-3 in both the high and long jumps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central's Kaylee Barnes was the runner-up in the high jump (5 feet, 2 inches) and long jump (16 feet, 7.5 inches) while Ryan Braccia nabbed two third place finishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She cleared five feet in the high jump and made a leap of 14 feet, eight inches in the long jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm very proud of both the boys and girls," said Ryskowski. "They came into the meet with something to prove and showed that they can compete at a championship level. Kaelyn Gonzalez had [a] huge day, earning all-conference status in three events. This team has come such a long way and I'm excited to see where we go next."&nbsp;</p>
