<p>WILTON -The Class L field in scholastic wrestling is always a loaded one and over Friday and Saturday, both the programs from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern did well at the annual championship event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrestling was shelved last year due to the pandemic and the locals were eager in hitting the mats at the Class L championships from Wilton high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Xavier of Middletown won the title, scoring 318.5 points while runner-up Simsbury chimed in with 234.5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squads are usual state powers in wrestling and the program from Middletown ramped up five first place wins and four second place finishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Trojans had two champs, a single victor for second and third and captured four fourth place finishes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern finished in ninth place overall with 91 points while Central took 11th, collecting 72 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers tallied one second and two fifth place finishes while the Rams earned a second and a sixth over a busy day of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple local grapplers were in the finals as Central’s Will Hamilton (120 pounds) and Eastern’s Alex Marshall (160) just missed out on individual state titles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamilton battled Xavier’s Jackson Heslin through three periods, dropping a tough 8-5 decision and then at 160, Edward Barlage (Guilford) just upended Marshall via a 3-2 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers earned two fifth place titles as Gabe White (126) earned a pin-fall win over Jack Wiesbrock from Daniel Hand in 2:20 while Dylan Piazza (182) pinned Joseph Della Ripa of South Windsor in 1:44.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then for the Rams, Umar Malick (152) fell to Daniel Hand’s Cameron Chieppo in the fifth place bout - pinned at 3:55 of the second period.</p>
