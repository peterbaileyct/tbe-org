<p>WEST HARTFORD - The Bristol Central wrestling program battled some steep competition at the Greater Hartford Open from Hall High School in West Hartford on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams made a quality seventh place finish, scoring 100 points and was able to top several other CCC programs that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>East Hartford won the tournament behind 292 points while Haddam-Killingworth (168 points) was the runner-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington (164½ points) took third place, Killingly (146½) earned fourth while Ridgefield (137) nabbed fifth to pace a busy day of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had a couple grapplers battle into the final round which included stud Will Hamilton - earning the championship nod at 120 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the title bout, Hamilton shut out Ridgefield’s Alex Blaha by a 5-0 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hamilton, having an outstanding season, was joined in the finals by teammate Landon Dionne (138 pounds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dionne gave East Hartford’s Jaeckez Mendez all he could handle - and more - before the Bristol grappler fell via a 3-0 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in third place matches, the Rams had athletes in both the 132 and 220 pound consolations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central earned fourth place tallies as Aiden Lamarre (132) drew a no-contest against Victor Petkov from Ridgefield and at 220, Killingly’s Devin Exarhoulias pinned Central’s Michael Thaxter in 1:15.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Wednesday, the Rams are back home - squaring off against Maloney in a CCC South confrontation at 6 p.m. - while on Saturday, Central travels to Xavier in Middletown for a little tournament action.</p>
