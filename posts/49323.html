<p>Skunk'd, the game based on the Johnson family pastime, is a fast-paced dice game, according to the release, that is perfect for family gatherings or game nights.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The idea for Skunk'd originated from a game our grandparents taught us decades ago at their vacation home on Cape Cod,” said Dusty Johnson, in the release. “Whenever anyone failed to score, my Gramma Evie would exclaim “You skunked; so sad, too bad!” giving Skunk'd its name.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ken Johnson, along with his wife, Liz, and their children, Vicki, Dusty and Mandy, have transformed the beloved family pastime into a market-ready product.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the game has technically been around for 35 years, the Johnson family has spent the past year<br>focused on preparing for this moment. The Johnson’s developed a prototype, conducted playtesting<br>and collected feedback throughout 2023. </p>

<p>Ken and Liz Johnson have lived in the Orlando area since moving from Bristol, Connecticut in 2010.<br>The family coined the company name 'Hooked on Johnson Games,' a nod to their Bristol roots and<br>Ken's foray into local politics.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
