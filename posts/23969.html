<p>WEST HARTFORD -- There was absolutely nothing easy about the trek the Bristol Central boys basketball squad - the defending 2021-22 CIAC Division II champions -- took this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Tim Barrette was a competitor as a player and that fire and drive was in full effect during this season’s run to the Division I tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central never ducked a challenge and endured a very tough nine-game losing streak along the way, going 6-14 heading into first round play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what was the Rams reward for such a tough campaign, competing against some of the top teams in the state?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earning a postseason rematch against Northwest Catholic, a squad ranked second in Division I.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the 79-40 loss wasn’t the way Barrette wanted his senior crew of Mike Allan, Tre Blair, Mason Stokes and Jayeson VanBeveren -- along with Julius Powell still recovering from an injury -- to go out, the squad came to West Hartford and battled the full 32 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central put together a run midway through the fourth, an 11-4 jaunt, which was ended by all four seniors on the floor touching the ball and Stokes (team-high 11 points) burying a three off a tremendous sequence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And soon after that, Barrette pulled his senior core off the hardwood for one final time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told them what a great possession for them to end” on said Barrette. “Mason makes that three. I think all five guys touched the ball in that possession. There’s no better thing as a senior [to do that] and I said, ‘let’s end it there.’ All five guys got a touch on that possession. Jay kicked it out and Mason knocked it down.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a good way to end.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren, a huge part of Central’s title run last season, ended the year with a 12.4 points-per-game scoring average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior big canned over 20 three-pointers this year and did his best as one of the featured players of the program this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Allan (4.4 ppg) missed all but one game in 2022-23.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the missed contest was due to a heroic effort in Central’s final boys soccer game as Allan attempted to stop a goal from scoring that got him into a little hot water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talk about taking one for the team. Sacrifice from a senior leader goes a long way for a scholastic program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His defense was tremendous over the season while Mason Stokes (4.2 ppg) scored 22 points over his final two scholastic games - averaging 11.0 ppg to help the Rams go 1-1 during their final two games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tre Blair saw action in 19 games and finished his final contest with four points as his track &amp; field season is about to commence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, Powell only got on the court once -- at Bristol Eastern for an opening game lay-up (leading to a blistering 17-0 run) -- due to his knee injury and certainly would have been a difference maker in close games like the contests at Xavier and Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with games against both East and Northwest Catholic, Windsor, Farmington, Platt, Middletown and Conard this season, that senior crew never relented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talent just simply won out on the flip side against Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was obviously a tough schedule this year for them," said Barrette. "They gave me all the effort without a question.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An imprint was made by the seniors from the state title team last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was the junior class that had a front row seat for it, with some minutes sprinkled here or there during that championship run due to foul trouble and rest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the example that VanBeveren, Allan, Blair, Stokes and Powell left are also of a championship caliber.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Game time effort was never a question,” said Barrette. “I appreciate everything. They've had a pretty successful career [and] don't let this season judge what they did. They were part of that run last year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We don't get there without them."</p>
