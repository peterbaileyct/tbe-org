<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;The Bristol Eastern boys basketball program has been fortunate to have junior sharpshooter Jordan Chisholm take one of the leads on offense this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Chisholm could be nominated as the most improved player on the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because once Eastern is on the attack offensively, and Chisholm is draining shot, after shot, after shot, there’s not much stopping the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This young man is simply growing up before our eyes and his play speaks volumes about that growth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“His maturity is the biggest thing,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray of Chisholm’s growth. “He always had ability.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After averaging 7.3 points-per-game last season as a sophomore, good for fourth place on the team, he’s currently hitting 13.9 ppg and when he’s hot, there’s not a prettier shot in the league to watch splash in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might take a minute or two to warm up but when Chisholm sticks with it, those three-point bombs quickly start to fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the points add up quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Him being able to handle tough nights, I think that’s the biggest thing for him,” said Ray. “It has nothing to do with basketball. His biggest progression has been between his ears. He’s starting to learn to let things go. When you’re a shooter, you’ve got to be able to continue to shoot but he scores within the offense.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s one part of a good team which helps him, too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a reason why the Lancers are 7-2 this year as a lot of the squad’s success is due to Chisholm’s offensive gifts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To go along with those 14 points, Chisholm also chips in 2.4 rebounds, and 1.1 steals-per-game in just 22.0 minutes-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the past five games, Chisholm has led the team in scoring three times, including a sizzling 27-point outing in Eastern’s 76-51 triumph over Tolland on January 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 27 points were a career high and his seven threes tied an Eastern single game record for 3s made in a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During second quarter play at Enfield on December 19, Chisholm went a smooth 4-for-4 from 3-point land, on his way to 19 points and a box-and-one defense by the Eagles thereafter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about his most recent showing, going 5-for-11 from deep over the 19-point victory against Maloney on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chisholm posted 23 points and shot within the confines of the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He currently leads the squad in three-pointers made with 24 which is three less than he splashed in all of last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already, he’s in the top-20 all-time in program history in career three-pointers and by the game, he continues to climb the trifecta ladder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chisholm is a very good teammate, adds plenty of chemistry to the program and has the skills to match, making him a very well-rounded player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He plays on both sides of the ball and once this guy gets a little rest between his stints on the court, Chisholm is ready to drain long shots and 3-point bombs from anywhere on the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s ready to knock them down,” said Ray. “Also, being able to go to the bench, keeping [Chisholm’s] legs fresh, we rotate three or four guys in that position, and he’s really starting to understand that when you’re defending that hard, sometimes you have to be able to play offense tired.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“With him coming out and then going back in, taking a breath, I think has helped him, too.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 3-ball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like every player who hits the hardwood nowadays is shooting three-pointers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chisholm is no exception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The marksmen entered the season tied for 36th all-time in three-pointers made at Eastern and has nearly doubled that total just nine games into this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Chisholm and former Eastern baseball standout Sean Allaire opened the season with 27 made 3s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But 24 three-pointers later, Chisholm left Allaire in the dust (Allaire might be a better baseball player but that’s it).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, Chisholm’s three-point shooting prowess is moving him up the career list at BEHS by the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
