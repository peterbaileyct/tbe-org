<p>The Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP has announced that their annual Martin Luther King Jr breakfast has been postponed due to the surge in COVID cases locally and nationally. <br></p>

<p>Eric Clemons, branch president, says the committee determined this is the best course of action for now. “We certainly don’t like this, but safety for our members and those who would come out to honor Dr King’s legacy is the chief concern. Hopefully, we can get control over the surge within the next month and honor Dr King during black history month.”</p>

Space is limited due to COVID protocols, which will be in place for the safety of everyone who attends. This year’s theme is, <strong>“Moving together to achieve MLK’s Vision.” </strong></p>
