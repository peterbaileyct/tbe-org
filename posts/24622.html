<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern softball team made an improbable run to the semifinals of the Class L tournament last season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a remarkable dash to the postseason and this year’s crew wants to prove that run wasn’t just lighting in a bottle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battery is different, and some positions will see changes due to graduation, but the talent remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne will once again be one of the program’s standouts along with Ashley Serafin and hard hitting Emily Valentine.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who is going to pitch (and catch) for this crew with All-Conference studs Ali Tellier and Janessa Gonzalez graduated from the program?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will another tough regular season lead the Kingstreeters to another long playoff jaunt?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at the Lancers in 2023:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN SOFTBALL</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Tyler Catlin (Second season as head coach at Eastern).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 season</strong>: Eastern went&nbsp;13-11&nbsp;overall. The No.&nbsp;21st&nbsp;ranked team in the Class L field made a run all the way to the semifinals, falling to No. 1 Masuk 3-0 – the eventual state champs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Losses</strong>: Ali Tellier (Pitcher, CCC South All-Conference), Grace D’Amato, Janessa Gonzalez (CCC South All-Conference), Samantha Policki, Alex Shorette, Sarah Snedeker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Returning Players/Roster</strong>: Jazmyn Browne (jr, SS), Ashley Serafin (sr, 1B/P), Emily Valentine (so, CF), Gracie Browne (so, 3B), Makayla Antunes (jr, RF), Hailey Beebe (so, LF, C, P, 1B, 2B, Utility), Leah Webber (so, OF), Kayla Webber (so, 2B), Brooklynne Whitlock (so, P), Isabella Arborio (fr, P), Sarah Lacouture (sr, C), Gracie LaMar (jr, C), Corinne Sutula (fr, C).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2023 Season Outlook</strong>: What a run the Eastern softball team went on over state tournament play last season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The group looks a bit different as six seniors graduated out of the program, but talented pieces remain around the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that starts with two junior standouts, shortstop Jazmyn Browne and first baseman/pitcher Ashley Serafin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are expecting Browne and Serafin to be excellent leaders for this younger group,” said Catlin.&nbsp;“I obviously expect a lot out of Jaz and Serafin. With Jaz last season, I thought our team was at its best when you could see her big smile on the field. It was contagious with her teammates.&nbsp; Teammates gravitate to her and her positivity.&nbsp; So, we are going to need that even if she makes an error or has a bad at bat. Her teammates are going to be looking to her for reassurance all the time.&nbsp; I thought she got robbed out of an All-Conference selection last season, so I'm rooting for her to have that success similar to last season and achieve it this season.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin brings offense and defense back to the mix and could she time in the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If she can take another step forward, Eastern is going to be all the better program for it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Serafin was a player I never had to worry about last season,” said Catlin.&nbsp;“With a team last season with a lot of personality, Ash was a steady force in our lineup last year.&nbsp;She hit some big home runs for us last season.&nbsp;The one versus East Haven in the quarterfinals is really sticking out to me right now.&nbsp; We are going to need Serafin to continue to be that steady influence and that player that leads by example on and off the field.&nbsp;I expect Serafin to get a good chunk of innings on the mound this year and settle back into her gold glove spot at first base when she is not pitching and be that intimidating force in the middle of our lineup.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomores Emily Valentine (centerfield) and Gracie Browne (third base) will also supply defense and a little pop at the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I believe Valentine may turn some heads out in centerfield and at the plate this season,” said Catlin. “Gracie Browne returns her gold glove defense to third base this season. Her quickness and ability to cover bunts and get outs for us really puts opposing teams at a disadvantage to play small ball.&nbsp;She will be our leadoff for us this season.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valentine put up All-Conference numbers last season, leading the team with 27 hits and sporting a .461 on-base percentage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with junior Makayla Antunes (right field), Catlin will have some experienced players to turn to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Makayla Antunes was another prominent returning starter for us from our successful team last year playing right field,” said Catlin.&nbsp;“’Mak’ has been hitting missiles this season and we are going to need her to produce some punch for her to replace some of the seniors we lost last season including Tellier, Gonzalez, Shorette, D'Amato, and Policki.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now the question becomes who will be chucking from the circle this season?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be a combination of different athletes after several seasons of stellar ability from Tellier which will include Serafin among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I believe you will see a combination of Ashley Serafin, Brooklynne Whitlock and Hailey Beebe on the mound for us this season,” said Catlin.&nbsp;“All have done a nice job finding that groove during our preseason schedule and all bring a little different look to the batter.&nbsp; I believe we will need all three of them to succeed. However I am not opposed to riding the 'hot hand.'&nbsp; Freshmen Isabella Arborio has impressed so far this spring and has dominated JV scrimmages.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You may hear her name before the end of the season.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Gonzales gone, Catlin turned the clock back a bit as senior Sarah Lacouture returned to the team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s very likely she’ll catch a ball or two behind the dish along with Hailey Beebe, Gracie Lamar or even freshman Corrine Sutula as players continue to jockey for positions. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At catcher, we have a comeback story in Sarah Lacouture,” said Catlin.&nbsp; “She played her sophomore year but sat out last year.&nbsp;Sarah returns this year and is vying for playing time behind the plate. She's a great kid and I have appreciated her hard work early in the season getting back into the swing of things.&nbsp;Hailey&nbsp;Beebe has also impressed behind the plate.&nbsp; She's a bit of a jack of all trades, very versatile, doesn't have an ego and will do whatever is best for the team. I see her as a very important piece to our team's success this season wherever&nbsp;we put her on any given day.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace LaMar has shown some promise behind the plate and will compete for playing time while freshmen Corrine Sutula looks like a seasoned veteran at catcher playing at the JV level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then a couple of the Webber girls, Leah and Kalya, will factor into the lineup as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah could be a contributor in the outfield while Kayla may compete at second base or another infield position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leah Webber has impressed in the outfield this spring and is vying for playing time as a ‘defensive stalwart’ and a player that brings excellent energy to the park each day,” said Catlin. “Kayla Webber has impressed at second base and will compete for playing time in the infield.&nbsp;She too has impressed on the defensive end and believe&nbsp;it or not, has very similar energy as her sister.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[I’m] looking forward to their progress this season in helping this team.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South is always a grind and the top teams in the league always give the Lancers fits.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strangely, Eastern gets Berlin out of the way early this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After opening with the squad on Wednesday from the softball field on King Street, and dropping a 17-2 decision, the rematch takes place next Wednesday at 11 a.m. from Sage Park in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, it’s a town the Lancers’ veteran coach grew up in while Eastern will battle Plainville on May 12, a couple old Northwest Conference foes Catlin has seen in the past. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Berlin is where I graduated 2003,” said Catlin. “[I]&nbsp;played for the great Leo Veleas and that storied Berlin HS baseball program.&nbsp;I have randomly started a family and I now live in Plainville.&nbsp;Growing up Berlin vs. Plainville in my eyes was the closest thing to Red Sox Yankees in terms of rivalries.&nbsp;Our baseball games from Little League to high school were always close and sometimes even contentious.&nbsp; However, now that I'm on the other side of the rivalry, and representing Bristol Eastern, Berlin is always circled on my schedule.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Let’s just put it this way, I'm taking my team out for dinner if we win.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Eastern players might enjoy that meal from ‘Almost but not quite Steak’ on Farmington Ave, Eastern had a busy preseason, playing teams such as out of conference foe Jonathan Law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scrimmage was a good test with Catlin noting he was happy to see Law coach Jason Pires last Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget to circle the calendars on May 1 and May 18 as Eastern battles Bristol Central in city series play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin and Central were both 6-1 in CCC South action last season, the leaders of the division.&nbsp;</p>
