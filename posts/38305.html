<p>The 2023 CIAC football playoffs has seen a little bit of everything this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And out of the six classes, only one of those divisions ended up with the top two seeds making it to championship weekend (Class M).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means in the other five classes, the final showdown won’t see a match-up between the number one and two programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another division, some way, somehow, the number seven and eight seeds made it all the way to the championship (Class SS).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only one team from the Central Connecticut Conference is in the championship and that’s Bloomfield (10-1 overall), looking for another Class S championship to add to its impressive collection.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two number eight seeds are in the mix as Watertown (7-5) is ready to vie for a title in the Class SS bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program has won four straight games to qualify for the finals, clinging to a 3-5 ledger at one point of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watertown squares off against No. 7 Joel Barlow as the squads have combined for nine losses this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s incredible for a title bout in any division.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Class L, No. 8 Darien (9-3) is also vying for a championship this weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While there isn’t any local team in the title mix, four of the squads have one loss while there aren’t any undefeated programs left standing in Connecticut.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Title games this Saturday and Sunday will be taking place from two venues across the state.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arute Field, on the campus of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, and Rentschler Field in East Hartford will be the host sites this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a ton riding on the line, her are the 12 remaining teams vying for titles as the fall scholastic campaign is about to come to an epic end:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
