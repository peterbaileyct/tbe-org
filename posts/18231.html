<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Eastern girls soccer program dropped a tough 3-0 decision to Simsbury on Tuesday in a CCC interdivisional tilt from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell to 1-6-3 overall while Simsbury (2-2-6) won for just the second time in 10 tries but the program has an amazing six ties already on its ledger in 2022.</p>

<p>Simsbury outshot Eastern 25-4 overall but the Lancers hung around to keep within arm’s reach of the lead until late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Lancers created some opportunities throughout the evening but Simsbury was always there to clean it up,” said Eastern coach Scott Redman. “Leah Roy created a few chances off set pieces but Eastern just couldn’t find the other end of&nbsp;the ball.”</p>

<p>The Trojans started the scoring just five minutes into the showdown as Charlotte Roberta turned inside the box and chipped a ball that floated over Eastern keeper’s Abigale Pelletier’s head to make it 1-0.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then midway through the frame, Simsbury’s Maxine Samson beat her defender and played a beautiful ball in to Sammy Lombardi who lost her defender and perfectly placed a shot into the near post corner of the goal as the visiting aggression led 2-0</p>

<p>The only goal of the second half was tallied eight minutes in as Simsbury’s Reece Williston poked in a loose ball off a broken corner kick for a score that gave the Trojans an imposing 3-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pelletier was under fire the entire affair but managed to scoop in 18 big saves as Eastern’s defense played very well against a good program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cecelia Gilbert played great in the middle and pushed Simsbury for all eighty minutes,” said Redman. “Shannon Philippon provided great minutes on defense and up top.”</p>

<p>The Lancers next travels to Hall in West Hartford on Thursday for a CCC Interdivisional confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
