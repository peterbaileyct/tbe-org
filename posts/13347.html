<p>BRISTOL – On a windy Tuesday afternoon, the Bristol Eastern girls tennis team battled RHAM in a CCC Interdivisional tilt and hung in against a very good squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers ended up dropping a tough 5-2 decision to the Sachems from the tennis courts at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters, now 1-10, split singles action as the program’s top two players got to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, RHAM was able to sweep all three doubles contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top singles bout of the day, Eastern’s senior standout Brooke Treannie had a back-and-forth first set against Lauren Fenton, eventually wrapping up a 7-5 win before dominating the second – snaring a 6-1 victory to seize the contest.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the No. 2 slot, Adrianna Reay was also a winner for the Lancers, defeating Teresa Hooker by similar set scores of 6-4 and 6-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Sachems then won the final two singles matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM’s Bridget Austin won against freshman Vanessa Cyr (6-1, 6-1) and then in the No. 4 bout, it was&nbsp;Sophia Drama defeating Eastern’s Taylor Berube (6-1, 6-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In doubles play, the No. 1 duo of Addison Brown and Grace Baran defeated Eastern’s Olivia Dossias and Trisha Mohan by set scores of 6-1 and 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers’ No. 2 team of Ava Gesner and Maria Perrone fell to Morgan Fazzino and Anna Lauenberg (6-3, 6-0) and in the final doubles contest, the combination of&nbsp;Christine Dia and Sammy Shumbo topped Eastern’s Samantha Rivard and Makayla Warnat (6-1, 6-1).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is right back to work today against Middletown in a CCC South showdown from the Bristol Eastern tennis courts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match will be the final home match for Eastern’s senior class as the program still has a couple left to play on the road, including the city series bout against Bristol Central on Friday at 3:45 p.m.</p>
