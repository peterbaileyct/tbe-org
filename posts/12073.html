<p>Come Sunday morning, TBE will have finally set up our links for readers to support our efforts. On our website, there is a green box with the links: 1) the membership link will allow readers to continue reading free, to become a supporter with a $6 monthly contribution, to become a patron with a $12 contribution, to become a benefactor with a $20 monthly contribution, or 2) to hit the donate link to make a single donation. <em><strong>These links are posted at the bottom of each story.</strong></em></p>

<p>Receipts will be from the Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project, under which TBE operates, and will be filing for 501(c)(3) status. The CCOJP is registered with the state as a nonprofit and has for its mission educating the public about all-things journalism.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why TBE needs financial supporters and donors now&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First and foremost, we are a business. To be a viable business we need a solid source from which to raise revenue, and we believe that our plan is tied to the belief that our readers will recognize our commitment to our community. And remember, whatever we raise goes back into the community rather than a corporation. At the same time, we believe that the news should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability to donate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, what readers&nbsp;pay goes back into the community in the form of responsible reporting and a respectable public forum, it goes to support that effort by providing fair compensation to our reporters, editors and writers, to our programs to develop young reporters and to be accountable and transparent to our readers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a model of newspaper that is truly homegrown and supported.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4>Why now?&nbsp;</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have outgrown our all-volunteer phase. We are at the point where we need to move to the next level, primarily, to expand our reporting, especially, our coverage of local government—regardless of what party is in office. Government needs to be accountable to the people it represents, and we all know that without thorough and steady coverage, that is not possible.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among other areas TBE plans to expand are these:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>We are looking at paid internships for area college students, from Bristol. Ideally, we hope to garner enough financial support to hire full-time reporters. A good community newspaper not only covers local government, but is also covers the city, its people, its businesses, where we come from and where we are going.&nbsp;We need reporters to bring us those stories.&nbsp;</li><li>We will be partnering with the high schools to get them a forum of their own. We hope to attract a few students to report for us.&nbsp;</li><li>Lastly, we will continue to present public forums for our readers to join us to discuss how best to use our resources to cover Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h4>We believe in Bristol</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, we have the firm belief that the people of Bristol recognize our value and will support TBE, making us a viable business and one that will be around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you can, please support TBE by becoming a supporter, patron or benefactor—if possible with a recurring monthly donation. Single donations are also welcome. Click on the Membership or Donate buttons on our front page. There is no better time to contribute than now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“Come Sunday morning” is intended to be a weekly review, a recounting of the past week and an anticipation of week to come. Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism. He can be reached at dfortier@bristoledition.org.</em>&nbsp;</p>
