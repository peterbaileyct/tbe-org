<p>The Bristol Eastern volleyball team knew they were in for a tough match-up Wednesday, traveling to RHAM to face the defending state champions. And as they say, RHAM does not ever rebuild; they just re-load.</p>

<p>And a young Lancers team got a close-up view of volleyball excellence, losing to the Sachems in straight sets.</p>

<p>The score in the first set was 25-8, as RHAM dominated from first serve to final spike.</p>

<p>Eastern made it more respectable in the last two sets, losing by scores of 25-19 and 25-17.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Samara Paranzino had 3 aces, 1 kill, 2 blocks, and 2 digs for the Lancers. Andrea Martir-Perez added 14 digs for Eastern.</p>

<p>Bristol Eastern is now 3-2 on the season, and traveled to Berlin Thursday in a rare back-to-back schedule feature. TBE had no score on the Thursday match when we went to press.</p>
