<p>We started with this classic song because TBE is terribly disappointed. We asked the Supreme Court for total immunity, but we didn’t get it. We are only immune when writing a story, thinking about a story, talking to someone about a story or reading a story — so we need to chase the clouds away.</p>

<p>Speaking of clouds, they are mostly gone today. It will be a great day to be a Bristolite. The high will be near 84.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 2, 1897, Queen Street residents petitioned the City Council to have their street name changed to King Street, but the name was already taken.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Important question for neighboring towns</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why is there no Bristol Avenue in Farmington, Burlington, Terryville or Wolcott? Out of respect, Bristol named streets after them. Why no reciprocity?</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
