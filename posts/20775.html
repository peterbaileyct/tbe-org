<p>While the snow blanketed Bristol in white, five of the state’s top jam bands came together in an epic benefit concert for Brian’s Angels at Bleachers Bar this weekend drawing friends and neighbors for an afternoon of music, food and comradery.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We needed to do another fundraiser because we’re seeing so many clients right now,” said Pat Stebbins. founder of the charity that serves the homeless. “We’re feeding upwards of 60 people a day now; in 2020 we were feeding a little over 20.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People can’t afford the cost of things, and it’s only going to get worse,” said Stebbins. “I’m seeing new faces daily.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stebbins founded Brian’s Angels&nbsp;in memory of her son Brian Pinz, who died in 1998 after having a period of homelessness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Psychedelic Sunday” came together with the help of Brian’s Angels’ friends, including promoter Mike Cansdale of BigMac productions and musician Jeff Summa of Jeff Summa and the Roasters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pat and&nbsp;Brian’s Angels&nbsp;do so much for others; I’m just happy that I could do something to help,” said Cansdale. “We have a really good community and they really showed up today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is one of the best lineups that we’ve ever had for an event,” Cansdale said. “All the musicians and everyone involved are donating their time.”</p>

<p>Summa put together the lineup, which featured Rob Glassman Band, LB4, Neybas and Someone You Can X-Ray. Jeff Summa and the Roasters, who headlined two prior Brian’s Angels benefits, also took the stage for an hour long set that featured songs from their album “Open Road Ahead.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pat called me and said she wanted to do another concert, so I reached out to some friends,” said Summa. “The first four bands I asked all said yes right away.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve known some of these guys since the 80s,” said Summa. “They’re great musicians and they all wanted to help.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Summa also served as the evening’s emcee, greeting others with kind words and introducing all the music.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the first bands that Summa thought of for the benefit concert were Neybas, who are currently climbing the Relix/Jambands and AMA American radio charts with their album “Sunshine Hotel.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neybas guitar virtuoso and song writer Russ Waesche is well aware of the importance of the Brian’s Angels mission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Brian’s Angels are doing something phenomenal; they’re supporting others,” said Waesche. “They’re providing basic human needs that everyone deserves; there’s nothing more important than that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before finishing their set, Waesche dedicated “Love Your Neyba,” to Brian’s Angels; a Neybas original song featuring the lyrics “He’d give food when folks were hungry and give ‘em drink when they were dry. Said he’d welcome a lonely stranger and give him shelter from falling skies.”</p>
