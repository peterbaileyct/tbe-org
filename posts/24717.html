<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – The batting order for the 2023 Bristol Central baseball squad can be extremely lethal, whether facing the top or bottom of the lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Rams were bottled up a bit offensively over their showdown against Plainville on Friday afternoon, it was the bottom of Central’s order that was able to topple the CCC South foe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With ducks in the pond in a 1-1 game in the bottom of the seventh, Central’s Christian Stafford smacked a roper up the middle for the game-winning hit as the Rams foiled the Blue Devils by a 2-1 final from McCooey Field on the campus of BCHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central moved to 2-0 off the winning effort while Plainville fell to 1-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The set-up was perfect in the seventh as Central’s Mikey McMahon reached base via a ground-out error and then went to second on a wild pitch by Plainville pitcher Sean Eagan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Aiden Lopez (1-for-2, triple, run) walked and the duo each advanced a base on a passed ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the runners on second and third, Stafford – the ninth batter of Central’s lineup – made it academic with his single to center to ice the game. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up with both of Central’s RBI that day from the bottom slot of the order.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To be honest with you, I don’t have a bottom of the order,” said Central coach Bunty Ray. “I just have to put the guys there. I have as much faith down there as I do [with the top of the lineup]. Last year, Christian was a three-hitter. Aiden was at the top somewhere. Right now, we’re just kind of moving guys around on what we think we can do to put a lot of pressure on the [opposing] team.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central pitcher Nate Pirog (5 IP, 4 hits, 7Ks) had a tremendous outing though he didn’t factor into the ultimate decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oscar Kuzniar threw a scoreless sixth and seventh inning to seize the win for the Rams. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lost in the effort was an impressive performance by Eagan (6 IP, 2 runs, 4 Ks, 1 BB) who only allowed just five hits and kept his team in it until the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am proud of him. He competed today,” said Plainville coach Lou Mandeville of Eagan. “You could see it in his eyes. He’s a focused guy on the mound and he had a few pitches working today so he was able to keep hitters off balanced a little bit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And I thought we did a good job playing defense behind him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit belonged to Plainville’s Mike Bakaysa (1-of-2, double) who drilled three balls to the outfield to keep the Central fielders in motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bakaysa was robbed of an extra base hit in the sixth inning as Central centerfielder Joe Gratta tracked down the ball, making a sensational catch that would have otherwise netted another run for the visiting contingent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He made a hell of a catch in centerfield,” said Mandeville of Gratta. “That was a great catch.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the first, Plainville’s Charlie Hills drew a one out walk but never advanced while Central put together a two-out rally in the bottom of the tilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzniar flipped in a single and Frank Spirito got plunked with a pitch to put two on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Egan fanned Ryan Ring to end the threat as the contest remained scoreless through one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Mike Allan made a slick throw from shortstop to get a hustling Tate Stevens going to first to end the Blue Devils’ portion of the second.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the game was delayed for over thirty minutes with one out in the bottom of the second over a very scary situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home plate umpire took a ball off the left wrist and was forced to leave the contest (during the delay, Kuzniar was putting on some sort of photo shoot near the Central dugout).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a replacement umpire was found,&nbsp;play resumed and so did the scoreless affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pirog was on fire in the third, whiffing the side, as the Rams were looking to draw first blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s always solid,” said Ray of Pirog. “He’ll keep you in the game, but you’ve got to make plays and score some runs. I gave him credit. He wasn’t allowed a lot of run support. He was just going out there and doing his job and making sure that we were in the game long enough to win it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went down in order in the third before Bakaysa smashed a double to deep center with one away in the fourth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Pirog wiggled out of trouble as the Rams came to bat in the bottom of the fourth of the 0-0 stalemate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ring zipped out a single down the left field line with two outs but never advanced while Plainville put another runner in scoring position in the fifth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stevens nabbed a one-out single to start a rally and Gavin Cooke bunted him over to second, but Pirog buckled down, striking out Dylan Cianci for his seventh K to end the threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went for broke in the bottom of the fifth and with one away, Lopez slapped a ball into deep right.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fielder slipped a bit, and the race was on as Lopez chugged around second base and easily made it to third.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Stafford grounded out at third, but Lopez was already halfway home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball went to first base to get Stafford for the second out, but the RBI tally propelled Central to a 1-0 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gratta then advanced to first on a passed ball strikeout and went to second on a botched pickoff attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s&nbsp;Anthony Santilli followed by slipping in an infield hit that died on the third base side of the mound, but Gratta attempted to score off his wide turn at third.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he was gunned down at the plate as the contest remained a 1-0 game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the sixth, Plainville’s Mike Ouellette and Hills had back-to-back hits and off a passed ball at the plate, each runner advanced a base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Central catcher threw the ball into left field, Ouellette came home and suddenly, it was a brand-new game at 1-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve got to give Plainville all the credit in the world,” said Ray. “They’re scrappy. They battled us the whole game. Last year, we had a hard time with them early in the season. Lou is doing a good job.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzniar quickly relieved Pirog and with no one out, Bakaysa absolutely drilled a ball to center, but Gratta never gave up on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He eventually snared it out of the air for a huge game-saving out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The play of the game was Gratta,” said Ray of the catch. “He went a long way to go get that. Last year, we had a hard time in the outfield. This year, I love my outfield. The way they go get the ball, that’s a luxury. It’s good to see we have that option out there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end Plainville’s sixth,&nbsp;Seth Lizon walked, Matt Bonney bounced into a fielder’s choice and Keith Lagassey was tagged out off a passed ball third strike as the game remained a 1-1 affair while Kuzniar did not allow a hit over his two innings of relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzniar&nbsp;started off the bottom of the sixth getting plunked by a pitch as pinch-runner Joe Mauriello made it all the way to third base before getting stranded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central pitcher&nbsp;made things interesting with two away in the seventh, hitting consecutive Plainville batters with a pitch, but with two on, Hills grounded out to Kuzniar on the mound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kuzniar legged out the play, sliding into first base for the last out and with the showdown still notched at 1-1, it was time for game-winning heroics by the Rams in the bottom of the seventh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Central third basemen finished things off with his hot shot through the infield as the home team wrangled up a 2-1 win over Plainville to remain perfect on the campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a game we had a chance to win,” said Mandeville. “If you’re coming to watch a game it was a good game to watch. And I tell [my players] when we get on the bus somewhere, our job is to go out there and compete and give ourselves a chance to win.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And we had that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray saw his team earn a big home victory to open its slate of games in Bristol and the veteran coach knows that the offense will come around as the year progresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we can get certain things going, get baserunners on – that’s how we won our first game against Hall – stealing bases and getting timely hits,” said Ray. “We have to continue to do that until we can get our bats going.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
