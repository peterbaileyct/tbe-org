<p>The Bristol Greeners of the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League continue to compete and hang in during the 2023 campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite having a tough start to the campaign, Bristol continues to get to work on every game night during the GHTBL’s 94th season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The local squad has several former players from Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern and St. Paul Catholic in the lineup and have been battling the best competition in the GHTBL since moving away from the Tri-State Baseball League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol has been competing in the GHTBL for three consecutive seasons and the locals play their home games from both Bristol Central and Muzzy Field this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Greeners season to date</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is 1-12 overall this year, having lost nine straight games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners lone victory came on May 31, a 4-3 triumph over the East Hartford Jets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Former Bristol Eastern player Trevor Nohilly earned a complete game win for the locals, allowing seven hits, walking four while fanning a half-dozen batters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long time Greeners player AJ Lorenzetti was 2-for-2 with an RBI while Josh Nohilly also smashed out a hit for Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sean Borden and Gil Roy nabbed RBI tallies to lead the Bristol outfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall this season, three of Bristol’s losses were by two runs or less but regardless of the final regular season result, the Greeners will have a spot in the postseason tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Game: Greeners fall to the Record-Journal Expos</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past Friday, the Greeners had a 1-0 jump on Record-Journal but ended up falling in the end, 7-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol out-hit the Expos 8-5 as Borden had a tremendous day at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 4-for-4 from the dish, scoring both runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bryan Capezzone, Keegan Bartis, Gabe Zamorano Jr and Felix Gutierrez all zipped up hits for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jon Pierce and Borden each stole a base while Matt Fusco added a sacrifice for an RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christian Peterson started the game for the Greeners, going four innings, allowing four runs on four hits to go along with two walks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Special challenge in Hartford on Thursday</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners will be playing from Dunkin’ Park on Thursday night at 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol, coached by Trevor Mays (second season), will be battling the Record-Journal Expos at 6 p.m. in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before then, the Greeners will take on the Vernon Orioles from Muzzy Field in Bristol on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
