<p>The PHP was out on patrol Sunday morning and had our pick of the potholes on Perkins Street. Whowee!</p>

<p>If you have a pothole to report, you can do so by clicking <a href="https://bristolct.seamlessdocs.com/f/reportanissue">here</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Speaking of Perkins Street</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perkins Street was built in 1884 and was named for the Perkins family that were farmers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1927, the road had become so impossible to travel due to mud visiting physicians had to park atop Chippens Hill and walk a mile through the sludge and goo to visit their patients. Sounds like fun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1981, the police department sought the public's help locating paths wild dogs used to attack livestock in the Perkins and Hill Street areas. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to look for</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday, Aug. 23, the Fair Rent Commission Task Force will hold their monthly meeting at 6 p.m. at the Bristol Public Library. The word on the street is that they have their first two cases. Let's see where this goes. Paging Orville Redenbacher. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
