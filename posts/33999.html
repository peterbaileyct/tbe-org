<p>Arianna Therriault, the arts and culture supervisor for the Bristol Park System, was generally pleased with the first concert that debuted on Saturday at the Rockwell Theatre. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Celebrating Queen," featuring Bristol’s own Joe Archambeault, returned to Bristol to perform on a stage that Archambeault once walked across to receive his eighth grade diploma. Archambeault and his tribute band delivered a high-octane show that had the audience cheering and singing along. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything was clicking when a power outage brought the show to a sudden stop. The group gamely continued for a time, with Archambeault singing to a piano accompaniment using only the power of his voice to reach the audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even that came to an end when the emergency lights in the theatre had only 15 minutes of power remaining. The crowd of 315 people proceeded to the exits, happy with the fact that the band gave them everything they could, including an audience performance of "Bohemian Rhapsody" that had everyone smiling on their way out the doors.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therriault was upbeat about the debut of the Downtown Live performances. The attendance number of 315, about 50 percent of the theatre’s capacity, she considered a success. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We learned a lot from this first production," she said, "especially on the ways to promote these concerts on social media.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said she expects the advertising to reach more people and draw larger crowds in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reviews audience members gave in an exit questionnaire were very positive, she said. People loved "Celebrating Queen," and the theatre itself drew rave reviews. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were some complaints about the absence of refreshments, she said and added that the Board of Education controls the policy of what food and drinks will be allowed. The hope, she said, is that the issue will be resolved before the next show, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show with Live Shadowcasting  by RKO Army."</p>

<p>Therriault also said that work has already begun in planning performances for 2024. Nothing is set in stone yet, but several acts are being lined up for January and February.</p>

<p>The remaining schedule for Downtown Live performances for 2023 include the following:</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
