<p>Early voting for the Nov. 5 election begins in Bristol one week from today. The Registrar of Voters office has provided the following guidance for those who will be voting early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"When you arrive at City Hall Council Chambers (Level 1), you will check in and be verified as an eligible voter," an email signed by Democratic registrar Kevin McCauley and his Republican counterpart Jolene Lusitani. "Once verified, you will receive your ballot with an approved ballot envelope."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Signs will be posted to guide voters through the building to council chambers. There is direct elevator access from the North Main Street entrance. Entrances on the north and south of the building have ramps to access the elevator via hallways or level 1 hallway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"You will complete the ballot at a privacy booth and seal it in the ballot envelope, then put your signature on envelope where instructed," the email said. "Once sealed and signed, you will place your ballot in the envelope into the ballot box as instructed by the election officials. Ballots will be secured unopened in the Town/City Clerk's vault until Election Day when they will then be counted by election officials."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Based on the office's experience with the previous elections, the email said, that the office does not anticipate any issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting for the presidential/general election will begin Monday, Oct. 21 and continue through, including Saturdays and Sundays. Except for Tuesday, Oct. 29, and Thursday, Oct. 31, early voting hours will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. On Tuesday, Oct. 29, and Thursday, Oct. 31, hours will be from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early voting takes place in council chambers on the first floor of city hall, 111 No. Main St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Please note that if you plan to Early Vote after normal City Hall working hours or the weekend," the email said, "you'll need to enter from the North Main Street main entrance, as it's the only door that will be open for entry."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those who have not registered, the deadline is Friday, Oct. 18. Voter registration by may must be post marked by this date. Those registering at the Department of Motor Vehicles will have to the close of business on this date. Registration online must be completed by 11:59 p.m. In-person registration must be completed by 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Registration during the early voting period is available every day at the Registrar's Office in city hall. Same day registration on election day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, is also available all day at the Registrar's Office in city hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anticipating questions about the difference between early voting and voting by absentee ballots, the email said, "Absentee Ballot voting requires a reason (from a list of six, which can be found at <a href="http://MyVote.CT.gov">MyVote.CT.gov</a>). Early voting is available to every eligible voter without a specific reason. Early Voting may be done only in person, not via mail or drop box."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each early voter who casts a ballot will be recorded by an election official in the council chambers, the email said, which prevents that voter from voting at any other location during early voting, casting an absentee ballot or voting on election day.</p>
