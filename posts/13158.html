<p>STORRS - Maybe a big victory on the road is exactly what will jumpstart the baseball squad over at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And pitching ace Ryan Maglio helped to make that happen on Tuesday, throwing a complete game, two-run, six-hit gem as the Lancers downed Edwin O. Smith by a 7-2 final from Farrell Field Park in Mansfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 4-8 over the winning effort while the Panthers fell to 6-8.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio struck out seven and walked just three – getting stronger as the game went on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired the final seven batters he faced and held the home team to just single runs in both the third and fourth frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, a five run third inning was all the offense the Kingstreeters needed to wrangle up win number four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Eastern’s Ben D’Amato had three hits, including a double, while driving in four runs and Jaydon Churchill added two hits, scored twice, and drove in two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Cole&nbsp;Latko made a couple outstanding plays in the field as the Lancers were sharp in support of Maglio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a scoreless game going into the third tilt before the visiting aggression went for five runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Conor Cyr, Latko, and Elliot Norris opened the stanza with consecutive singles, loading up the bases with no outs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then sent a fly-ball over the left fielder's head, scoring two, as the Lancers nabbed an early 2-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the returning Preston Guarda followed with a walk to reload the bases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio&nbsp;then added a fielder's choice RBI groundout which resulted in the game’s third run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The play at the plate was too late to force out the runner at home and then the throw to get Maglio at first also did not produce an out – making it a 3-0 with more to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato followed with a pop fly single to short left field, scoring the final two runs, as Eastern scooped up 5-0 cushion which was never seriously challenged the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After scoring single runs in both the third and fourth innings, the Panthers still trailed by a 5-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio ended up walking the leadoff batter in each inning as both runners came home to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers picked up two insurance runs in the seventh, making it a five run contest once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A single from Churchill and an infield error put two on for Eastern to open the seventh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both runners scored on D'Amato's long double to right center as the Lancers eventually wrapped up a 7-2 win in Mansfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming Schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers finish out the week with two huge games, continuing to make its push for the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, it’s the third straight game for the Lancers as the program travels to Palmer Field for a 4:15 p.m. game against Middletown in a CCC South affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Friday, it’s going to be a great afternoon of baseball action as both Bristol Eastern and Bristol Central play games from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams start the day at 3:45, taking on Berlin and then in the nightcap – at about 6:30 p.m. – the Kingstreeters battle Plainville in a CCC South tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, Eastern was supposed to open the twin bill but the games between the Bristol programs were later switched.</p>
