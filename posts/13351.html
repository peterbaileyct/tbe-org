<p>Making the shift from old news to new news takes a while, and people are catching on. A small financial contribution today has payoffs that extend into the future, not only in that we get more timely news but in that we get more substantive news reporting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Substantive reporting goes much deeper, and it goes deeper through building relationships--between people and actions; between decisions and how they were made and who made them; between past, present and future. These relationships develop slowly over time and through trust. TBE aims to be your trusted source for news--to take you along with us to see how these relationships develop, to connect the dots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, TBE doesn't want to tell you what to think but to provide you with this information so you can draw your own conclusions, to develop your decision-making muscles, the same ones that are necessary to maintain our democratic principles, ones based on that marvelous balance between individual rights and our civic responsibilities.</p>

<p>The small contribution is key to our belief that good journalism should be available to everyone, no matter what their economic situation. At the same time, small contributions mean the costs have to be spread among a greater number of readers. Join the numbers of people who embrace this thinking and this new model for community news.</p>
