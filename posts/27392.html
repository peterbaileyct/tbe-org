<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol American Legion 17U squad has been lighting up the scoreboard as of late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And some of the scores haven’t been even remotely close between Post 2 and the competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take Tuesday’s night game as Enfield traveled to Bristol in a Zone 3 confrontation from Riley Field for example.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one was never close as Post 2 zipped up an 18-2 victory over just five innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over a two-pronged attack, Bristol had 15 runs in the bag after three completed frames, out-hitting Enfield 11-7 and batting .379 for the game (11-for-29).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everyone got involved in the fray as four players earned multiple hits for the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky (three runs scored), Gabe White, Mason Harris (three runs scored) and Tate Stevens all wrangled up two hits apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Simard, Jonathan Montgomery and Luke Colfer each tallied one hit to lead the surging offense from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simard was clutch from the hill, earning the win for Post 2 over three innings and 57 pitches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relief pitcher Drew Martineau (43 pitches) mopped up over the final two tilts, keeping Enfield off the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was over early after a six run first saw Post 2 bat around, eventually bouncing starter Brady Tyburski from the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He faced 11 batters, gave up five earned runs, hit two batters and allowed three base-on-balls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A nine run third helped Post 2 snare a 15-2 edge - never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol snatched another three runs in the bottom of the fourth to complete its 18-run scoring binge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the docket</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, the 17U program from Bristol hits the road to take on RCP from Xavier High School at Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time commences at 5:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about Post 2’s showdown against Torrington at 1 p.m. from Riley Field on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES</strong>…Bristol has outscored the opposition 51-17 this season and that offense is tops in Zone 3…Post 2 is a perfect 4-0 at home this year…Bristol entered the night one of four undefeated teams in the zone. Torrington (5-0 overall), Middletown (3-0) and RCP (2-0) have yet to taste defeat, but will all play Bristol over a short stretch of days.</p>
