<p>NAUGATUCK – The Bristol Eastern volleyball program gave it a whirl in its showdown against No. 3 Farmington in a Class L semifinal on Wednesday afternoon from Naugatuck High School. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tenth ranked Lancers played a tough first set but the River Hawks were big, athletic and skilled at all positions – eventually wrapping up a 3-0 decision over the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington moved on to the finals, squaring off against No. 12 St. Joseph from East Haven High School on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sets went 25-21, 25-16 and 25-12 as the Kingstreeters (15-9) fell to an incredible program from the Central Connecticut Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, led by an amazing senior crew, pushed their teammates as best they could before eventually falling to, perhaps, the future title holders in the form of the Red Hawks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The girls have done such a great job at so many different things,” said Eastern coach Stefaine Reay of her seniors. “Just from like building bonds with each other and setting examples. My seniors have set fantastic examples for all of the younger girls and what we want the program to be about of hard work, of having fun, and supporting each other.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They did that all the way up until the end of the game tonight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters left it all on the court and weren’t satisfied with just showing up in Naugatuck as the underdog.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern led 4-1 of the bat in set one as a block and point by Adrianna Reay fueled the team early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teammate Gabby Caucci kept up the pressure as her long corner kill gave Eastern an 8-6 lead with Farmington struggling a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That push moved to 11-8 midway through the set before Farmington used a 9-3 burst to capture a three point lead at 17-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay continued to force the issue with some big swings and the Lancers were hanging around as a Caucci kill got Eastern to 23-19.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the frame, Reay dropped in a left side kill and then added a slick bump-over to tally a point to make it a three point game before one final kill by Farmington’s Brooke Jones gave the team a 25-21 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second set started the same as the first as Eastern setter Naseem Hennouch got the offense into motion, making crips passes and helped get the front row into position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay drained another kill and when a tap-over by Jamayrie McRae-Arroyo hit the Farmington side of the court, Eastern was leading 4-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The River Hawks tied things up at 6-6 and then a blistering 12-3 jaunt, including a couple kills by outside hitter Lucy Scudder, stretched out the Bristol deficit to 18-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Farmington earned all their points for sure,” said Reay. “They played fantastic.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple of Reay swings made it a 19-12 game but the deficit eventually grew to 11 late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Farmington wrapped up a 25-16 decision in set two as the higher seed was looking for a closeout in the third and final game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters never led over the final period of play but kept things close early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a bad serve from the River Hawks, coupled with an ace by Andrea Martir-Perez, trimmed the deficit to 7-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Farmington quickly put the event out of reach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The River Hawks used their superior front row height, depth and firepower to score several points and off an 11-3 run, the third seed made it a double-figure affair again at 18-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reay had a couple late kills and an ace, Caucci put down a ball that was never returned but in the end, Farmington won the final set 25-12 – scooping up a 3-0 sweep to move on to the Class L championship tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We did what we could,” said Reay. “Could we have played better? Maybe, but the girls fought as much as they could.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The semifinal showdown was the final scholastic match for Eastern seniors Katie Beaulieu, Samara Paranzino, Andrea Martir-Perez and outstanding outside hitters Adrianna Reay and Gabbi Caucci.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTE…</strong>Adrianna Reay will join Central’s Alex Rivera at the annual Senior All Star Game on Monday, November 20. The bout takes place at 6 p.m. from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on the campus of Bristol Central. &nbsp;</p>
