<p>Families from across Bristol converged at the Open Field at BAIMS on Saturday for the Second Annual Family Fun Day, immersing themselves in a day filled with activities, food and entertainment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s good to see so many kids and families having fun,” said Bristol Early Childhood Alliance Coordinator Donna Koser. “That’s what we wanted, and we’re just so happy to be able to do this again.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family-friendly activities were plentiful, including seed planting, bracelet-making, balloon animals, face painting, bubbles and beach balls. Children had the opportunity to cool off from the 80-degree heat and frolic in a sea of bubbles courtesy of a foam party provided by Rolling Video Games. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the highlights for many young visitors was the touch-a-truck activity, where children interacted with local emergency vehicles from the Bristol Fire Department and Bristol Police Department, as well as large transport vehicles from D’Amato Construction Co, AZ Roofing and Skytop Motors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attendees had the opportunity to savor a diverse selection of cuisine and sweet treats from popular local vendors, including Spot on Tacos, Kraftwich Foodtruck Greer’s Cluck Truck and Daren’s Ice Cream. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Free water was available to all guests courtesy of the Bristol Water Department with popcorn donated by 99 Restaurants available at the Making Bristol Better booth.  All children in attendance were provided with a $4 food vouchers that could be used at any of the food trucks onsite. </p>

<p>“We’re happy that we were able to provide food vouchers for the kids,” Koser said. “Thank you to our wonderful sponsors; we couldn’t have done it without their support.”</p>

<p>Several local organizations that provide services to children and families were onsite, including United Way of Central Connecticut, Making Bristol Better and the Bristol Public Library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
