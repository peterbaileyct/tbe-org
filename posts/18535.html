<p>NEWINGTON – The Bristol Eastern soccer program wrapped up a 1-1 tie against Newington on Friday evening – moving to 3-5-3 on the campaign – from Alumni Field in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington slid to 6-2-1 overall as the Lancers continued its playoff push with a big tie on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has five matches left this season to snare a spot in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first half was a back and forth affair but Eastern was unable to get a clean shot at Newington's goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the home squad put the Kingstreeters behind on the scoreboard in the first half with a late tally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington’s Shawn Langu knocked home a loose ball close to the Lancers' net with 12:21 remaining in the stanza to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Nor’easters never scored again as Eastern’s defense held the fort the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We battled defensively in the first half and wanted to slow Newington's potent attack," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp;"In the second half we pushed our attack and had more of the play.&nbsp;I'm really proud of the determined effort across the board as our pressure resulted in five corner kicks in the second half."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 25:45 left in the showdown, the Lancers finally drew pay dirt with a match-tying goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Ty Borry cross to Justin Sanchez was deflected over the end line by Newington, Eastern earned another corner kick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cody Greger took that corner kick and knocked a ball out to Sam LaMar at the top of the penalty area.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His pass found a cutting Anthony Rogers who scored his first goal of the year, knotting the score at 1-1 with a ton of time left on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers continued the pressure offensively but could not generate the go-ahead goal, settling on a 1-1 stalemate after eighty full minutes of play.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern goalie Peyton Cummings came up big late in the game snaring two solid shots&nbsp;off Newington counters, etching up nine saves overall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nor’easters keeper Dakota Hawes stopped seven shots to lead the defensive charge for the home outfit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern next entertains Middletown on Tuesday at 6 p.m. from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters will be holding Senior Night festivities when the Blue Dragons (7-3-1) come to town.</p>
