<p>MERIDEN - When the Bristol Eastern boys soccer team hits the pay window, those players - and coaches - expect to collect a handsome bounty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s exactly what happened on Tuesday afternoon at Platt High School in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South bout saw the Lancers win its third straight match with its 8-4 demolition of the Panthers, moving to a stout 4-1 overall, while Platt fell to 2-4.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eight goals were a season-high for the Eastern program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers Liam Sanchez-Barreto and Platt's Angel Aguilar led their respective teams with three goals apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This wasn’t an easy challenge as Eastern took the lead, lost it, but regained the edge before the halftime horn sounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers jumped to an early 2-0 lead as Sanchez-Barreto picked off a pass and scored with less than two minutes gone on the clock.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moments later, Rocco Barbino fed Eddie Ansah a diagonal pass to the top of the area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah put the pass home as Eastern was in good shape at 2-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the crafty Panthers came firing back - nabbing a one-goal edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aguilar scored on two free kicks midway through the first and converted on another score after collecting a ball in a scramble in front of the net to help Platt capture a 3-2 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But with minutes to go before the half, the Kingstreeters drew even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, it was a Fernandez to Barbino connection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez made a long throw-in and Barbino knocked in a hard ground shot to tie things up at 3-3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the Lancers went ahead just before the half (3:30) when Ledio Thanasi sent a cross to a cutting Barbino who scored his second goal of the showdown as the Kingstreeters grabbed a 4-3 lead going into the halftime recess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was a crazy first half as Platt pushed a lot of players forward and Aguilar hit two top-class free kicks," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.&nbsp; "We withstood the storm and asserted our wing play to spread them out and open holes in their defense in the second half.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sanchez-Barreto opened the second half scoring with 32:38 to play, getting an assist from Ansah and collected a second score 61 seconds later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off another assist by Ansah, Sanchez-Barreto scored again to push the Eastern edge out to 6-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ansah notched a score of his own after Lucas Tylicki found him angling to goal, helping the visiting aggression to a 7-3 lead with 15:49 showing on the clock.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt made it 7-4 on an own goal with 14:03 left but Tylicki had a response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He closed out the scoring at 3:05 on a solid strike after Barbino sent him a through ball as Eastern surged in front 8-4 - eventually seizing the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's goalies, Peyton Cummings (five saves) and Connor Murtaugh (one save) combined for six stops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt's also used two keepers as Gabriel Dushi (five) and Dylan Polick (four) had a total of nine saves but were under fire from the start.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers host Berlin Thursday at 6 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After winning their first two matches, the Redcoats have gone 0-2-1 and will have their hands full on Thursday against the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
