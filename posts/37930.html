<p>Plans for the next discussion in their panel series, next steps for the youth coalition and more work on a resource list are typical topics for Diversity Council members to toss around at meetings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most of Tuesday's regular monthly meeting at the Bristol Public Library, that is what happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last minutes of the meeting were decidedly different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Introduced by chair Jaymie Bianca just before adjournment, as the final item of business for the meeting, newcomer Antonio Lopes read aloud from a document he found on the internet. The document said something in a way that he had not heard before and needed to share it, he explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"One of the overarching reasons for my getting involved with the Diversity Council here was the uptick in adverse events, concerning ones, a pattern we are starting to see around the county," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He explained that these events, circling racism, appeared to elicit different response depending on people's experiences. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There are some people who sit back and will say that they don't feel there is any real racial animosity across the country because they are not exposed to it." he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"And I think the thing that blew me away {about this statement] was that you don't usually hear people in positions of authority in this country take harder line stances about racism," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It really blew me away and at 65 years old it takes a lot to blow me away," he said. "I've seen a lot."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He explained that the statement, by Erie County Court Judge Susan Eagan, was read by Eagan before the sentencing of the shooter who killed 10 people in Buffalo, N.Y. last May.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopes read more of the document than what appears here: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This indictment speaks to the 13 victims and their families that lost the most. But they are not the only victims. There are thousands that have been traumatized directly and vicariously by this defendantâ€™s actions. We have seen the community turn out in support and are seeing signs of much needed change in East Buffalo. It is a testament to the power of love and compassion to overcome evil and hate by turning pain into purpose. But it is just the beginning. We have a long way to go. This hateful act and other similar hateful acts across the country motivated by white supremacy and replacement theory are a reckoning for us as a nation. The ugly truth is that our nation was founded and built in part on white supremacy..."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the meeting, the council discussed its panel series, which it plans to resume in February. Among the topics raised was young people's experiences with racial injustice associated with LGBTQ2+ culture. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Discussion about next steps for the youth coalition, included an outreach to the high schools for two youth representatives each, the possibility of a book-center or article centered discussion group, having a youth panel that would bring young people together and to move ahead with young people who show and interest in participating with the coalition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The resource list of area institutions and business that promote diversity, inclusion and equity once again was raised, additions to the list discussed and set aside for further consideration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bianca made a plea for more outreach through social media, several times, expressing its significance both for the council but also a part of a broader outreach to other communities dealing with their own issues surrounding diversity, inclusion and equity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In attendance were Diversity Council members Sandra Kamens, Allison Willette, Jordan Lopez, Marcus Patton, Lopes and Bianca. Olivia Chapdelaine joined the meeting online. City council member Sue Tyler was in the audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At present the coalition has six members, and the hope is that the group will expand to 10 by reaching out to Bristol Eastern, Bristol Central and Bristol Prep, Bianca said, following the meeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bianca added that while there is so much more to be done, she is proud of the council's presence in the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are growing our presence in the community," she said, "and I can't wait to grow even further in 2024."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She cited as positive contributions the council's quarterly panel discussions, a presence at community events such as the Hispanic Heritage Festival and the Bristol Farmers Market, and the start of the youth coalition, which supported cultural days at Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern high schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goals for 2024, she said, would be to continue the panel series, engagement with young people and the completion and launch of the resource list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next month's meeting, on Tuesday, Dec. 26, it was decided would be online. In January, the council will resume meeting in city hall rather than its temporary meeting place in Meeting Room 3 at the Bristol Public Library.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
