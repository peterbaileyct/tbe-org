<p>The Little Free Library at the Federal Hill Green has been vandalized for the second time in six months.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The damage was discovered by Jackie McCauley on Wednesday morning while cleaning up Federal Hill with a neighbor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“My neighbor and I were cleaning up the litter in the area,” she said. “We picked up 16 bottles around here, then I suggested we walk to the park. We saw some books torn, and the door had been ripped off of the little library. Some books have been burned there, and there’s damage to the gazebo. It’s such a cute Little Free Library, and it’s sad that it’s been vandalized again.”</p>

<p>McCauley reported the incident to both the Bristol Police Department and the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services (BPRYCS) Department.</p>

<p>“The Police Department said that they will be stepping up patrols on Federal Hill, especially around the park area,” McCauley said. “The Parks and Rec Department are going to fix the damage to the Little Free Library and the damage to the post too. They were all great and wanted to help.”</p>

<p>The Little Free Library was established to promote reading and improve access to books for all ages. Situated next to a gazebo and playground, it has become a cherished spot for visitors, offering a diverse selection of books for children and adults. The structure features a quote from Dr. Seuss: “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more you learn, the more places you’ll go.”</p>

<p>Edward Martin, who frequently visits the area with his dog, Bella, expressed his dismay at the repeated acts of vandalism.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I walk by here about once a day, and I’ve seen books all over the ground before," he said. "Someone knocked the whole thing over like six months ago; the post, the box, the books, all of it. It’s sad that people do things like this. The little library’s such a nice thing for the kids; for all of us.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
