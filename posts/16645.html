<p>When former Bristol Eastern volleyball standout Hannah Webber was deciding on her collegiate future in the sport, she knew she wanted to play on the NCAA Division I level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Merrimack College – one of the newest programs in NCAA D-I – showed interest in the front-line hitter, Webber decided to link up with the Warriors program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right off the bat, the talented Webber was thrown into the mix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several first year players have to sit and watch as freshmen but at Merrimack, Webber got into the action right away for the women’s program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 6-foot Webber is a middle blocker for the Warriors, playing in all four matches to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s collected 24 kills overall, blocked six shots and added 27 points in what’s turned into a busy start to the 2022 campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a great situation for the volleyball stud from Bristol as the program at Merrimack went into the holiday break at 2-2 – putting together two big victories from the court at the University of New Hampshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber’s first collegiate contests came on August 26 as Merrimack split two matches up in Durham, New Hampshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors dropped its first showdown against UNH and then rebounded to defeat St. Peter's University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Hampshire won it’s bout by a 3-0 push, but the Warriors rebounded with a 3-0 sweep over St. Peter’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the loss to UNH, Webber posted six kills and two digs while in the victory over St. Peter’s, the competitor from Bristol etched up five kills over the winning effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following day, Merrimack continued its winning ways as the Warriors defeated the University of Hartford on August 27 by a 3-1 final from UNH.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The back-to-back victories ended up being the first time the Warriors have won two straight matches in the NCAA Division I era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber crammed the Hawks with a season-high nine kills, three digs, and four blocked shots over a slick stat-line to foil the soon to be NCAA Division III outfit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her 11 points against UHART was also a collegiate high while she tallied her first assist to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Tuesday, August 30, Holy Cross traveled to Andover, Massachusetts as the Warriors held its home opener.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cross ended up snaring a 3-0 win with Webber reeling off four kills as the program fell to .500 to complete play over the month of August.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s played in every set to date, is currently third on the team in kills and second in blocked shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there’s a lot more to come from the talented freshmen talent at Merrimack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber had an excellent career for the Lancers volleyball program, earning Class L All-State honors by the&nbsp;Connecticut High School Coaches Association&nbsp;and was named&nbsp;to the&nbsp;2021 AVCA HIGH SCHOOL ALL REGION 1 squad as a senior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last fall, she helped lead the Lancers to the Central Connecticut Conference&nbsp;Girls Volleyball Tournament championship as Eastern entered play as the number seven seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the championship tilt, Webber posted 33 kills and two blocked shots as the Lancers came from behind to topple Simsbury, three games to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She helped the Kingstreeters to a deep run into the Class L state tournament fray as well before Eastern was stopped by Simsbury in the quarterfinals (28-26, 25-20, and 25-15) to end her scholastic career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber, Lauren Bender and Abby Jones all earned CCC South All-Conference recognition last season as the Lancers went a perfect 7-0 in conference play – going 14-5 over regular season competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern won over 20 matches during Webber’s senior campaign while she collected an impressive 562 kills while blocking 30 shots to lead the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Fans from Bristol Eastern have a question for the volleyball competitor: Does Webber still enjoy tasty CHEEZ-IT crackers after every match at Merrimack? She always had a box in tow after defeating opponents from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium at BE. For the record, those amazing CHEEZ-IT crackers were introduced in the year 1921 as the product is now 101 years old (and counting).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
