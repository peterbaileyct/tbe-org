<p>BERLIN - The Bristol Central cross country squads made its 2022 CCC South debut on Wednesday and the Rams had a tremendous day of running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the boys, there wasn’t much doubt as Central hung losses on both Berlin (23-33) and Platt (15-50) from the course at Pistol Creek in Berlin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Frankie Porrini did not have an equal on the course, easily winning the event in 16:34 over what turned into a romp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini might be the top runner in all the CCC South this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Rams took four of the first five spots in the showdown against the CCC foes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Chris Roy (18:01) was the runner up, Patrick Wininger (19:09) nabbed fourth place while Lance Archibald (19:23) rounded out the top five in the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, Braydan Dwyer (12th, 20:58), Nick DiMatteo (13th, 21:22) and Aiden Georgakopoulos (14th, 21:24) all ran well as Central moved to 2-0 overall on the young campaign.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the girls end, the Central program ended the day at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central flipped Platt (15-50) but lost to home standing Berlin (22-35).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams nabbed three of the top nine spots at the event as Sophia Stark finished in third place with a time of 22:31.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Katie Tran came in fifth place in 24:04 while Lynae Lewis took ninth (25:36).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rounding out the top-seven for the Rams were Emma Cavallari (11th, 25:41), Johannie Juarez (12th, 25:46), Maura Waters (14th, 25:53), and&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ruth Smith (17th, 31:46).</p>

<p>Central has ten days off between meets as the Rams are back to work on Friday, September 30 at the Harry Geraghty XC Invitational.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, October 3, Central returns to CCC South action against neighboring Plainville at 3:45 p.m. from the middle school in town.</p>

<p>Maloney also travels to Plainville that day to take part of the meet.</p>
