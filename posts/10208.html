<p>BRISTOL - After an outstanding fall scholastic season, a couple members of the Bristol Central boys soccer program earned some well-deserved postseason recognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the 2021 boys Scholastic soccer New England Region team has a familiar name on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the usual all-conference accolades, senior midfielder Carson Rivoira earned that All-New England nod.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, Rivoira and senior Mark Palma earned spots on the Connecticut All-State team as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s an impressive ledger for the senior duo, leading the Central boys soccer program to an impressive 12-4-2 ledger over 18 matches last season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s another special award for Palma as he became only the second player in program history to earn All-State honors twice for Central while Rivoira is the first ever player to be named All-New England for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the duo earned slots on the CCC South All-Conference team along with teammates Ethan Crumrine and Beckett Hennessey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those seeds of success were planted over the last four seasons as Central improved by the campaign, starting with that talented freshmen class which included Rivoira.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Rivoira was a junior standout, he helped the Rams to a 6-5-2 record in 2020 which included a couple victories over crosstown rival Bristol Eastern - both during regular and postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira, a captain last season as well, posted six goals and four assists which was just a sampling of things to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a senior, Central’s 12-win campaign allowed the program a No. 8 ranking in the Class L CIAC bracket, making it to the second round of the playoffs against Guilford - losing a tough 1-0 decision in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rivoira posted astounding numbers of 19 goals and eight assists, becoming a bona fide nightmare on corner kicks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was a player you had to mark from the onset and even then, he was just bigger and stronger than most of athletes out on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He used his superior size and stature to overwhelm opposing defenses, simply getting a step on the opponent, and then drilled a header or blasted the ball past a hapless defense and into the goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one finished better locally than Rivoira did over the course of the entire season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Palma also had a good junior season, setting up his teammates and kicking in a goal or two along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offensive standout posted four goals and ten assists in 2020 and then the second-year captain upped his game as a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The midfielder boasted numbers of seven goals and nine assists and was slotted all over the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both captains had fast feet, were always in attack mode, and understood when to make the second pass to get a teammate the ball for a goal scoring opportunity.</p>
