<p>BRISTOL - One of the many reasons why the Bristol Central girls soccer program was successful in 2022 was due the play of senior midfielder Rachel Wygant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off that outstanding campaign, plus her work in the classroom, the women’s soccer program from Central Connecticut State University came calling for her services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a ceremony from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium on November 9, Wygant signed her National Letter of Intent to play soccer this fall for the Blue Devils in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the leader at Bristol Central thinks the facilities over at Central Connecticut will help Wygant be an even better player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve personally walked across that field” at CCSU said Central principal Pete Wininger. “It’s much more comfortable than ours is. It’s certainly a surface that I think is going to make Wygant faster which is one of the best qualities of her play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger knows all about CCSU as the educator earned his Master's Degree in Elementary Education from the college in New Britain and expects her to be just as successful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant helped the Central program turn things around over the years, a team that was looking at the playoffs from the stands last season to nabbing the CCC South Championship and a huge win over Bristol Eastern this year - a contest she scored a goal in - to help her team to a 2-1 come-from-behind triumph over the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was an offensive force the entire campaign and whether it was a match-tying goal against Berlin, netting the game-winner versus Conard, or dropping in two scores against playoff bound Plainville, Wygant’s offensive onslaught each and every game showed opponents why the senior stud was one of the best athletes the CCC South had to offer on the pitch this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant is another one of those grinders on the field and seemingly is always one drive away from turning a match around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That ability got her noticed and a chance to compete on the collegiate level awaits the talented senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When you talk about somebody who is [a model soccer player], you look for leader, you look for an athlete, you look for an overall good person and that’s really everything that is Rachel,” said Central soccer coach Vicki Malick. “She gives us everything that she has at all times. Every game, every practice, during the season, offseason, she’s literally the whole package.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wygant is always in attack mode but doesn’t need all the credit for self validation - making her a model teammate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has the ability to score multiple goal on the turf but team success is the real juice and Central nearly rolled up 10 wins due to her smart, heady play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league has made her a perennial CCC South All Conference pick but forget about the play on the field because Wygant is going to be a tremendous asset just in the classroom alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 4.3 points-per-game scoring average in basketball isn’t all that bad but when that’s someone’s GPA (Grade Point Average), as Wygant has maintained at Central, that means she’s one of the top students in the classroom in all the city of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One A-plus is rare unless you’re checking out Wygant’s report card.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She works really hard in school,” said Malick. “She works really hard athletically and she’s just overall a good person.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Malick’s first season as head coach of the girls soccer program and while Wygant and the newest mentor of the team weren’t strangers to each other, the duo established a tremendous bond - a relationship that’s always special in the world of athletics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have watched Rachel grow, I’ve seen what she’s done, I’ve seen what you’ve dealt with this year and I truly think you’re awesome,” said Malick of Wygant. “You’re truly an amazing person. There’s nobody more deserving for this that you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am so happy for you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the principal at Central also echoed the remarks Wygant’s coach made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve had the pleasure of watching you the last couple of years,” said Wininger. “The quiet leadership that you provide on the field is remarkable. In a sport where you are quite often outsized, you use your brains - your intelligence and skill - to make your way around the box.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She gives defenses a hard time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the lighter side, Wininger talked about the amazing lunches that Wygant brings to school every day - understanding that those meals brings all sorts boundless energy that the midfielder uses on the pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as she’s grown as a student and a player, the girls soccer team at BCHS has gotten better by the season - culminating in the program’s first CCC South title since 2008 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to go off and play Division I soccer in the fall, it’s certainly a testament to the hard work Wygant has put into her career and it’s paid off in a big way with the ability to compete at CCSU.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been a great last four years and it’s been a pleasure to watch her grow,” said Wininger of Wygant. “You are so focused and determined and it’s really impressive to see a young person have that kind of plan.”&nbsp;</p>
