<p>BRISTOL – Don’t sleep on the Bristol Eastern baseball team this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad finished the 2022 with a flurry and brings back several experienced arms to the mix this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers graduated four major contributors but if all the pieces fall into place, this could be the program’s most successful campaign under head coach Steve Gaudet.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, it won’t be easy with Maloney, Platt, Lewis Mills, Berlin and Bristol Central in the CCC South mix.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are looking for another playoff jaunt this season and here’s how Eastern will look in 2023:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN BASEBALL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Steve Gaudet (3rd season, 16-26 overall) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 season</strong>: After a 9-11 regular season, 23<sup>rd</sup> ranked Eastern battled Class L runner-up Maloney in first round play, falling 9-4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Losses</strong>: Elliot Norris (2B/P), Cole Latko (SS), Jaydon Churchill (CF/P), Connor McCormick (RF/P). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Roster/Possible positions</strong>: Rio Fernandez (jr, C/P), Jose Feliciano (sr, RF), Owen Myers (so, 1B/2B/P), Ryan Maglio (sr, 3B/P), Anthony Nocera (so, 3B/P),&nbsp;Ben D’Amato (jr, LF), John Montgomery (jr, P), Connor Cyr (sr, CF), Mike Roalf (sr, P), Caleb Molinsky (jr, P/SS), Noah Gatti (so, P), Kyle Babin (sr, OF), Preston Guarda (jr, 1B, injured), Mason Harris (jr, 1B/DH/SS), Brayden Schenck (jr, 2B), Declan Schenck (jr, 1B/P), Gabe White (jr, SS/2B), Jed Sutula (sr, C/2B).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2023 Season Outlook</strong>: Eastern&nbsp;was a little lean on experience last season but that won’t be a problem this time around. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers have a ton of arms locked and ready to go and the rotation will once again see players that have more than a little varsity experience.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This team is also fairly versatile, and players can be moved here and there as the season moves along.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I believe experience and depth are our two biggest strengths,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“Practices have been competitive, everyone is fighting for playing time and is willing/capable of playing multiple positions.&nbsp;Ben D'Amato, Ryan Maglio, Connor Cyr, Jose Feliciano, Rio Fernandez, Roalf, Guarda and even Owen Myers and Anthony Nocera (who are only a sophomores) have played many meaningful varsity innings.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think we may surprise some teams with the growth we’ve made since last year.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the key as Eastern hopes to be not just a year older but a year better and that pitching staff could go a long way in helping with that endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio (3-4 overall, 35 innings pitched, 37 Ks, 4.20 ERA) is one of the most experienced arms Eastern returns while Roalf (2-4, 29 Ks) threw 37 innings last year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez, Myers (1.68 ERA), Nocera (3.18 ERA), John Montgomery, Caleb Molinsky, Noah Gatti and Declan Schenck could all be asked to provide support on the mound this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is the most pitching depth I have had in my tenure here at Bristol Eastern,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;“Roalf and Maglio are established varsity pitchers who both have improved their&nbsp;velocity and ability to throw their&nbsp;off-speed in any count. Molinsky, Gatti, and Montgomery have impressed all preseason.&nbsp;Nocera and Myers threw meaningful innings last year and continue to mature and get better.&nbsp;Rio Fernandez has put in the time and effort to make himself a legitimate option in a relief role.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gaudet was still trying to fill a few positions around the field even after a few scrimmages were in the books.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players were battling for first and second base as well as DH though Myers will factor somewhere in that mix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The surprise of the squad could be Feliciano who had just 28 at bats last season but truly put the work in during the offseason to become a player to be reckoned with in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And D’Amato (.423 batting average, team leading 30 hits) like all the players from the D’Amato family, carries baseball genes in their DNA.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jose has put in so much work in the offseason,” said Gaudet. “He is in incredible shape, and is swinging the bat and playing the outfield with incredible confidence.&nbsp;Ben D'Amato obviously will continue to do what he has done at the plate his first two seasons as a Lancer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joining D’Amato and Feliciano in the outfield will be veteran Connor Cyr (center), a good trio on the defensive end. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever is thrown Eastern’s way, the crew over on King Street should be in good shape this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CCC South Outlook:&nbsp;</strong>The Lancers&nbsp;will be in the thick of the Southern competition once again this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Gaudet likes both Bristol Central and Maloney as favorites in the South.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Central and Maloney both teams have the pitching and the bats to make a run at a state title,” said Gaudet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The league is once again loaded and don’t be surprised if Eastern can pull off an upset or two along the way, playing some of those top-tier CCC South programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Schedule:&nbsp;</strong>Eastern is already out of gas money for the year due to its trip up to Storrs to battle Edwin O. Smith on Wednesday afternoon in a 5-1 victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Kingstreeters jump right into the CCC South mix this Monday against Lewis Mills (3:45 p.m.) from Clem J. Roy Field (where’s the new fence for the outfield??? And the dugouts? Here we go again…). &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are at Berlin (3:45 p.m.) on Wednesday as the CCC South schedule starts off with a bang.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season’s crosstown showdowns against Central commence from beautiful Muzzy Field on May 5 and May 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
