<h2>First annual Bristol Boys &amp; Girls Club gala draws big crowd </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Boys &amp; Girls Club "Paint the Future Gala" was held Saturday evening at the Aqua Turf in Southington, drawing a large crowd and celebrating its own youths of the year, long-time club members and one of the leaders of this year's Bristol Central High School state championship basketball team and speakers with their own inspirational messages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For two successive years, 2020 and 2021, the national Boys &amp; Girls Club youths of the year have come from Bristol. Josias Reynolds (2020) and Brianne Parker (2021), along with this year's Bristol Boys &amp; Girls Club winner Gabriella Vincente each presented short speeches recounting their introductions to and support from the Bristol club.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reynolds discussed autism and finding his calling as a teacher in several of the club's programs, Parker recounted overcoming obstacles from being born into a family affected by drug use and the loss of both parents early on and Vincente shared her struggles and victory overcoming a learning disability.</p>

<p> BCHS's basketball star Donovan Clingan had his BB&amp;GC jersey retired in a ceremony led by BB&amp;GC CEO Tamara Carlson that included Bristol native and ESPN NBA commentator Adrain "Woj" Wojnarowski and former Providence College star and NBA player Ryan Gomes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay Harris, ESPN anchor, was keynote speaker. He shared an inspirational message based on stories from his youth in North Carolina, centered on just what "woke" refers to, and drawing on his admiration for attorney Bryan Stevenson and his work as Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organization in Montgomery, Ala.</p>

<p>At one point in the festivities, kids from the club who were in attendance and who had received basketballs signed by Clingan took over the dance floor with a demonstration of their dribbling skills.</p>
