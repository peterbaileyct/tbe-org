<p>NEWINGTON - The Bristol Central girls basketball squad, the 16th rated program in the CIAC Class L fray, gave top seeded Newington an early run for its money in second round play on Friday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams fought gamely throughout the contest but in the end, the Nor’easters canned several long-range bombs, played extremely well defensively, and took care of business on their home court as Central fell by a 68-31 final in Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’easters moved to 23-2 on the season over the victorious effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All-State talent Lilly Ferguson led the charge with 17 points, Bela Cucuta flipped in 12, Selah Prignano scored 11, and Karissa Zocco had nine for Newington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’easters drained nearly a dozen three-pointers along the way as Cucuta hit four to lead the number one seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re not the biggest team so we played a 3-2 [zone], trying to extend out on them a little bit,” said Central coach Steve Gaudet. “We also thought about going man but if we went man, there’s some mismatches all over the place. We picked our time when to use that but it didn’t matter what we did. They didn’t miss and they moved the ball so well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I mean, their second five was just as good as their first and their third five was almost as good.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Newington wasn’t hitting from downtown, they attacked the paint with zest, snaring several offensive rebounds, chased down any loose ball, and tried to establish a quick lead though Central refused to go quietly into the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our keys today were to limit their second chance opportunities, hit the defensive glass hard, and we had to win every fifty-fifty ball,” said Gaudet. “It seemed like Newington got every fifty-fifty ball and then they hit a three.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Lillian Sirois matched Ferguson’s effort with 17 points of her own, cashing in 10 of those over third period play.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow senior Ella Watson added five points, Brooke Watson scooped in four while Arianna Rivera scored three.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaley Laird and Callie Lodovico all gave something to help Central hang around early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Those six kids gave thirty-two minutes of effort all night long,” said Gaudet of his squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington scored the first four points of the contest before two free throws by Sirois made it a 4-2 game minutes into the opening stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, the Rams didn’t net a hoop in the first stanza, making five of eight foul shots to hang around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A baseline 3 by Prignano made it an 18-4 game with 46 second to play in the first as a 14-2 run gave Newington a bit of a cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central then went on an 8-0 burst as Rivera hit a charity shot and put back a miss while Ella Watson dropped in a runner and then kicked in a three and with 6:55 left before the half, Newington’s edge was chopped to 18-12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We made a nice run,” said Gaudet. “And then they hit two 3s in a row I think to get it from six to 14. We had them second guessing themselves for little bit when we got it down to six but that’s a special team right there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They move the ball extremely well and I don’t think I’ve seen a team shoot like that in a long, long time…maybe in my coaching career.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’easters scored the final 14 points of the second frame - kicking in several 3s - as Newington led it 32-12 at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sirois never gave in as she kept whatever pressure she could on the Nor’easters to open the third period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior canned all of Central’s points in the third tilt as she hit a jumper and then flipped in a scoop shot as Central trimmed the deficit to 35-16 with 5:13 left on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Newington later dropped four 3-pointers in a row that pushed the game out of contention and when Sirois canned an and-1 and made an additional free throw, Central trailed 51-22 through three quarters of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the fourth, even after the home squad nabbed a 40-point edge, the Rams kept fighting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella Watson found Brooke Watson for a three and just over a minute later, Sirois flipped in a trifecta but with 3:33 left, Newington led 62-28.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the Class L event, Sirois dropped in her final two free throws and Laird hit a charity shot but the Rams - finishing a more than credible 11-11 this season - dropped a tough 68-31 decision to the top ranked squad in the bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Credit to them,” said Gaudet of Newington. “They are a talented team and they played well."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest was the final game for Central seniors Ella Watson and Lillian Sirois.</p>
