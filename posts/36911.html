<p>At 11 a.m., numbers of voters in today's municipal election are slightly ahead of those from the previous municipal election in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Overall that trend two years ago brought us to just about 32 percent at the polls," said Kevin McCauley, Democratic registrar of voters. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That figure does not include absentee ballots nor does it include voters who registered and voted the same day as the election. McCauley said those numbers would bring the total to 34 or 35 percent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 11 a.m., the total percent of those voting at the polls showed a slight increase of just above 11 percent this year, to just below 11 percent in the previous municipal election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last election, there were 37,669 eligible voters. This year there are 36,204. Six hundred absentee ballots were sent out and 550 returned by mid-morning. McCauley said approximately 50 people will have registered to vote by the end of the day. The average has been around 37.</p>

<p>The office receives counts from each polling site on the hour and records the figures on a chart that compares the current figures from those in the previous election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCauley, Democratic registrar, who is working his ninth election, said about this one, "I feel good, we get through it. We have good teams," referring to both the Democratic and Republican registrars who work together on each election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Republican registrar Jolene Lusitani is in her first election. She said she is excited and has been learning a lot. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"To narrow it down to one thing, I don't know," she said about the amount of information she is taking in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She settled on learning about all the statutes and legislation and requirements surrounding elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"That's number one priority," she said, "and then from there you kind of know what you are doing with your job."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
