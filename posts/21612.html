<p>BRISTOL - There used to be a famous commercial on television back in 1980’s that went something like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not only the Hair Club president, but I’m also a client.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while that former Hair Club president, Sy Sperling, tried to help several of the current TBE editors (editor comment- also sports writers) with their hair loss conditions - and failing miserably in the process - Bristol Eastern basketball standout Taigan Parent is a lot like that man from the commercial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent isn’t just a three-point shooter, but she’s also a complete basketball player.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior is one of the leaders of the Lancers’ program this year and that leadership was seen first hand when Eastern squared off against Northwest Catholic on Friday night over a big CCC Interdivisional bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to fend off the Lions in the end, 41-39, and Parent, along with junior guard Vanessa Drury, kicked in a combined seven three-pointers to stave off Northwest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Parent, who dropped an impressive stat line of 14 points, four rebounds and four assists against the Lions, wants to be known as more than just a lethal weapon from deep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I hit a few threes in the beginning,” said Parent of the Northwest Catholic showdown. “I’m trying to look to do more than just three-point shooting though.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But shooting - and making - three-pointers is a family tradition in the Parent family at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah it is,” admitted Parent with a grin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into the 2022-23 season, the Parent family had a combined 188 three-pointers made for both the boys and girls programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now the current total is at 205 overall as Taigan has two games of four three-point makes already this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She has 17 3s to date, posting nine three-pointers over her last three games, and has 38 trifectas for her career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 38 3-point tally puts her in second place in her family and that’s where her final ranking will be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s because big brother Elijah, now applying his basketball talents for the men’s program at the Coast Guard, is the all-time leader in 3s at Eastern with 133.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Father D.J. is currently tied for 42nd all-time in three-points made with 24 while Taigan’s mom, Bevin (Borajkiewicz) dropped in 10 during a time when the girls program at BEHS did not take many threes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s an amazing tally for that family but Taigan is truly a great all-around basketball talent as the Kingstreeters are on the cusp of getting back to .500 as the midseason approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Floyd nearing 600 career wins</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern girls basketball coach Tony Floyd is on the cusp of another tremendous milestone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With its 41-39 win over Northwest Catholic on Thursday night, Eastern got Floyd win No. 598 and will tally that huge milestone victory sometime in the coming weeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This could be all coming together with a 600th win possibility in a showdown against a certain crosstown rival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about a milestone bout against Bristol Central on Monday, January 16?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Floyd could tally his 600th win before then if his charges can pick off Glastonbury (7-2) on the road tomorrow and win at struggling Platt (2-5) this Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if the Lancers split the week, the game against Rams next Monday could be the night Floyd goes for his 600th.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t think Floyd’s players aren’t keenly aware of the looming milestone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was amazing,” said Parent of the Northwest Catholic win. “It gets us one win closer for Coach Floyd to get this 600th win which is nice.”</p>
