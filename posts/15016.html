<p>BRISTOL – Perhaps the second half of the season MVP for the Senior American Legion baseball squad in Bristol belongs to veteran Dylan Woodsome.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over just a handful of recent games, Woodsome has gone 2-0 on the mound and has been hitting the ball all over the field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His return to the Post 2 squad was a huge get in 2022, pitching when called upon, generating a critical hit – or two along the way – and even stealing a base when the need arises.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The likable Woodsome doesn’t say very much (unless teammate Mike Roalf tells him to "back-up" catching the ball in right field in Meriden…) as his play does all the talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he bounced back from a very bad looking incident in Simsbury on June 17 – popping out his shoulder trying to slide into third base as he bumped into the pitcher on the base paths, crashing down to the infield dirt in obvious pain.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Think back, the poor guy three weeks ago was laying at third base in Simsbury with a dislocated shoulder. I saw it. It was sticking out,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “It was pretty gross. And then he popped it back in himself in the dugout. For him just to come back…he’s had some huge hits and saved two games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was seemingly back and ready to play just a few days later after the injury and by the time July rolled around, Woodsome really started to bring it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in his last stint on the hill, an 8-4 triumph over Simsbury on July 13, Woodsome needed just 78 pitches to earn his second win of the year – moving to 2-1 overall.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Saturday before that, he threw 18 pitches to close out Torrington over a wild 8-7 win – scooping up the save in the process. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he was absolutely cruising against Simsbury to close out the season, throwing off-speed pitches and fooling batters throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Woody was in the groove but LaPenta wanted to save the chucker for another day – namely for some innings in postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s playing with a boatload of confidence now and don’t be surprised to see him produce something nifty in right field or on the bases with his smart, heady play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I didn’t know whether or not to take Woody out,” said LaPenta of the Simsbury win. “He was at eighty pitches and if I don’t take him out, he couldn’t pitch at all this weekend. Now, he can pitch on Sunday. We’re going to need the arms if we’re going to go anywhere to win our pod.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all hands-on deck, Woodsome is going to see some time chucking the ball over the weekend in postseason play.</p>
