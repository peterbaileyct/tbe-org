<p>To the editor,</p>

<p>I see that you reposted the article by Anna Bedell after correcting misinformation regarding a recent council meet and greet. I want to thank you for making the effort to make corrections; it is unfortunate that people not in attendance were quoted. However, the article is still far from accurate.</p>

<p>For example, I did not say that "I&nbsp;looked into&nbsp;thousands&nbsp;of data points,&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;hours of talking with city planners,&nbsp;talking with residents,&nbsp;talking with focus groups on what should be downtown;" I shared that the Plan of Development and Conservation adopted by the city in 2015 and reaffirmed in 2018 completed the significant research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The article further&nbsp;mentions that I discussed "a report by a woman in New York;" the actual attribution was to "a report by Goman and York."&nbsp;&nbsp;Goman and York specializes in leading-edge planning, development, and design for municipal government, as well as corporate clients, landowners and developers with market and financial feasibility studies. They opined on the location of Wheeler downtown in a letter to the city on how it was not in the spirit of Bristol's plans.</p>

<p>I can only hope the Bristol Edition will make every effort to make sure readers are properly informed.</p>
