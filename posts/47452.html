<p>Come Sunday morning, the heat will have tamped down a bit with a big shift coming on Monday. Part of the daily routine is a walk, but I waited until Saturday afternoon just before the rains to head out. A slight breeze always helps and it just so happened that there was one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few people had stepped outside, and one was walking. A neighbor sitting on his front porch reveled a bit in the break in the heat but admitted that inside it was stifling still. The night before when the big thunderstorms hit, a self-confessed fan of thunderstorms, he was out on his porch, and so was I. How the sky can darken in a moment's notice is always alluring.</p>

<p>A good week despite the heat. This past Saturday the Bristol Farmers Market open at its new location in the parking lot at 10 Main St.</p>

<p>Later on Sunday, a “Rock the House” concert to benefit the Bristol nonprofit Agape House will be held at the VFW Post 19791115 on Wolcott Rd., Wolcott, from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The benefit concert is being organized by Eric Smith, a&nbsp;four-time Emmy winning&nbsp;producer&nbsp;and owner of&nbsp;Rock Steady Events, and Larry&nbsp;Beaudoin of Beaudoin Design Company and band LB4.</p>

<p>Candidates for the upcoming election will be hitting doors this week.

<p>For listening, this week there is world renowned economist Luigi Zingales and Vanity Fair contributing editor Bethany McLean with the "Capitalisn't" podcast, "Joseph Stiglitz's Vision of a New Progressive Capitalism."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winner and chair of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton, has just published a new book, "The Road to Freedom: Economics and the Good Society" (W.W. Norton, 2024). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McLean calls it a "full frontal attack on neoliberalism," in the episode summary, while laying out a roadmap for a more progressive (healthy, my spin) from of capitalism. The podcast aims to critique capitalism to make it work for people rather than the other way around.

<p>For reading, I have fallen behind. There is Frantz Fanon's "Black Faces, White Masks" and "The Wretch of the Earth" and several others by Arendt, including "The Life of the Mind -- Volume One: Thinking" and "Thinking Without a Bannister." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did finish Arendt's "On Violence," which struck me as a work that has held up well, considering it was written in the late sixties. For background on Arendt, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt">here</a>. For information about Fanon, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frantz_Fanon">here</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't take much imagination to see that local newspapers of any quality are few and far between. Here at TBE, working under our nonprofit Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project, aim to make Bristol a community with a vibrant and engaged local community newspaper. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can help. Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>As part of our citizen journalism initiative, TBE is seeking 12 people with Bristol stories that they would like to share in the form of long-form journalism. This project involves identifying 12 people with a uniquely Bristol story, something that happened here in Bristol that says something about who we are as a community–during a specific time in our history.&nbsp;Please email <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org">editor@bristoledition.org</a> if interested. Type Bristol Stories candidate in the subject line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We will work with each person to develop a well-written long-form piece of storytelling for publication in TBE and possibly in other forms. More on this in the future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, we are seeking reporters to cover sports and city meetings, neighborhood news, people and entertainment--book reviewers and movie/tv streaming reviewers--take note. Contact <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org">editor@bristoledition.org</a> to for next steps.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
