<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have decided to sleep in after a babysitting stint Saturday night so the parents might get out for a belated birthday celebration. This time it was for two grandbabies, one almost 2-year-old and one almost 6-week-old. And of course, it was everything we thought it would be, including an extended bedtime for the oldest one, where I got to read 10 books and maybe more if Mary hadn’t showed up for “bedtime.” &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, I shifted to the youngest grandbaby and feeding time, which is a different sort of commitment and one that might be accomplished with the tv on, sound way down not to interrupt bedtime. So, I flipped through some of the offerings and landed on The Absent-Minded Professor, the black and white version with Fred MacMurray and flubber. Good times! &nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, the movie was a fitting end to week with some of its own interesting moments. I am referring to the most recent Board of Education meeting and the board’s focus on a resolution, which TBE covered, and which attracted the same contingent of voters, mostly anti-maskers, who once again voiced their opinion about what is happening as a result of masking in our schools. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A primary argument from the board about the resolution, which does not mention masking, is that the governor should end his emergency executive powers—ones which will end as the pandemic recedes and our ability to deal with the coronavirus improves. The board contends that the executive powers have tied their hands to do their job—creating policy. Board members have denied the resolution has anything to do with appeasing the anti-masking crowd, but what other policies do they have in mind except for reversing the current practice of masking? Interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there is the idea that policy making is solely their responsibility. It is the narrowest of interpretations of a local education board's mission, since any policy making involves policy making within the policies already established by the state. Context is everything. Local boards have for their primary responsibility providing adequate facilities beginning with buildings, enough teachers and supplies. And their role is limited to balancing the needs of students with those of citizenship. We create citizens in our schools. That is what we support both with our taxes and our rhetoric. This means every citizen has a vested interest in what happens in our schools. It’s complicated, right. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This board talks a lot about listening to their constituents, who, it turns out, are mostly the same people who are beating the same drum over and over—unmask our kids. Many are parents. Regarding the role of parents, it gets complicated, too. Parents also have a vested interest in the education of their children, however, parents' rights too are limited. The argument is something like this: a public education has for its goal the shaping of future citizens, so any demands by parents must be weighed against this standard. It’s all about balancing responsibilities and roles. So, yes, there needs to be a public discussion, but it needs to involve all these parties. (And of course, there are always exceptions to any “mandate” which might be handled on an individual basis.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which leads to this week’s listening/reading recommendation. This is one I highly recommend. It is another On the Media podcast, entitled “Read the Room,” and features segments on book banning, parents’ rights and students’ rights. Click <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/episodes/on-the-media-read-the-room" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Everything that is happening today is nothing new, in other words has a history, and needs to be approached in the proper context—it we want to get to the bottom of things and make sure we attend to our roles. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of roles, City Council is about to take up the latest iteration of the Wheeler Clinic proposal. Presumedly, it returns to the City Council this Tuesday for a vote, after having been revisiting by the Economic and Community Development commission where it received a unanimous vote. As things stand, there is no guarantee that council members, who voted down the original proposal, will change their vote.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, the council is preparing to sign on with the Board of Education’s resolution. More wasted time when there are many pressing issues to be dealt with.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be an interesting week.&nbsp;</p>
