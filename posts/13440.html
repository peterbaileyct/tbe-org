<p>The CAS-CIAC will honor and celebrate 350 statewide scholar-athletes this Sunday at the 39th annual Scholar-Athlete Awards Banquet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ceremony takes place from the Aqua Turf in Southington.</p>

<p>The Scholar-Athlete Program annually recognizes two high school seniors from each member high school whose academic and athletic careers have been exemplary, whose personal standards and achievements are a model to others, and who possess high levels of integrity, self-discipline and courage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event is the largest of the many honors programs CAS-CIAC hosts each year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The honorees are chosen by the member schools and are submitted to the CIAC.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six student athletes from Bristol schools will be honored at the event.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Bristol Central, Ella Watson and Beckett Hennessey will be honored that day along with Bristol Eastern’s Fiona Gallagher and Logan Crowley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the honorees from St. Paul Catholic will be Gillian Smith and Nathan Stellmach.</p>

<p>For a remarkable 36th time in the event's history, retired sports broadcaster Bob Picozzi will serve as Master of Ceremonies. Morgan Tuck, a four-time National Champion at UConn, five-year WNBA pro, and currently Director of Franchise Development for the Connecticut Sun, will deliver the keynote address.</p>
