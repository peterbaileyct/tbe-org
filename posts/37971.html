<p>Walking in the door with its Munch Box lunchbox logo, we are immediately greeted with a smiling welcome from Julia Lawton, manager. But that is not all. The atmosphere is bright with a counter lined with Avery sodas, of in various colors, mostly ones that brighten the space, and unusual varieties from the Totally Gross line, for instance, Worm Ooze and Toxic Slime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, there is a sense of humor running beneath the surface here, but it's the food that that stands out. Two chalkboards line the walls behind the counter, and they are dense with offerings. Quizzed about favorites, Lawton says that the chicken--sandwich, taco, flatbread varieties--and anything burnt ends are favorites.</p>

<p>Among the items on the menu are flatbreads, not exactly pizza crust and not exactly grinder rolls: Cheesed, Smoky Sweet Chicken, BBQ Chicken, Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese, Pickle (!) and Burnt Ends, among others; tacos: chicken, brisket (two varieties), burnt ends and fish; and the usual lunch fare from hamburgers to pulled pork and boneless wings, among others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A special feature is locally made ice cream from Big Dipper Ice Cream in Prospect. Avery's Soda hails from New Britain as do products on the menu from Martin Rosol's Inc. also from New Britain. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Krampitz orders the pulled pork sandwich. I go with the burnt ends tacos. We get Pepsis and a side of the sidewinder fries--like steak fries, Lawton says, but twisted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The food arrives--delish, and for me, nicely presented, since the tacos have a swiggle of creamy sauce across each one. Jack and I dig in, and agreeing that the sandwich and tacos are good choices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterwards, we pull Lawton aside to ask a few questions and get some photos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawton is the daughter of owner Carlo Bettino, who with partner Kate Giroux, run the new eatery, which is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday thru Saturday. Bits and Brew, which had been just around the corner in the same building, was the partner's first eatery. The former store is now the location of Cafe Real's second storefront.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She says business is good and getting better every day. Almost on cue, a customer, Fred Gould, pipes in that he has become a regular and that his favorite is the fish sandwich. A neighbor, Gould stops in a couple of times a week. He especially likes the hours because he isn't much of a breakfast person.</p>

<p>Munch Box is located in the plaza at 785 Terryville Ave, front right corner of the shops, with plenty of parking. Its fare is American, Mexican and BBQ, with eclectic art on the walls--an homage to American food--and a dining area with two tables, each seating four. </p>

<p>A kids menu is available as well as daily specials. On this day, it's Wednesday earlier this week, there is homemade chicken noodle soup, pretzel stick with dipping sauces and brisket, available on flatbread, in a sandwich or in a taco. (Note: Toasted Almond ice cream is sold out!)</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
