<p>On May 23, former Bristol City Councilor Mary Fortier was unanimously endorsed for the 79th House District by members of the Bristol Democratic Town Committee. The endorsement came following current State Representative Chris Ziogas' announcement that he would not seek re-election in 2022.</p>

<p>“I spent eight years on the city council demonstrating that I’m not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get to work,” said Fortier. “As a lifelong resident, I know the challenges we’re facing, and I know how to solve them. We’ve come so far since the beginning of the pandemic—thanks in large part to the tireless service of Representative Chris Ziogas—but there’s still more to be done. I’m looking forward to listening to voters and bringing people together to solve problems.”</p>
