<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have spent a pleasant evening with friends, over some delightful food and more delightful conversation. This little event a had been in the planning for ages, since one couple had to drive in from Brooklyn, and, well, we are all pretty busy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A fun fact, four of us were employed by the Bristol Parks and Recreation Dept., working during summers supervising kids at one of the then 13 parks across the city. But, because we hadn’t seen each other in such a long time, we didn’t dwell on any of that. The conversation was catching up and eating, oh, yes, eating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saturday was an eventful day, leading up to our gathering of friends. There was the opening of the new city hall to the public, with a ceremony, including speakers and then tours. The building really is a wonderful addition to downtown, and after many years, first getting it off the ground, the design work, then the work, and now a functioning building, Bristol has something to be proud of. It’s definitely worth a trip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the opening, Bristol Bazaar ran a puppy adoption event coinciding with the opening of city hall and there was a PRIDE event at Good Shepherd Church.&nbsp;And there was a Cocktails at Eight event with a surprise location.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week—I am not really sure I mentioned this one, but it is a terrific read so fair—”The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store” by James McBride. It was recommended by a friend, and, well, it is working. The background—the book begins with the discovery of a skeleton associated with an inscription, “The Greatest Dancer in the World,” and suspicion falls upon the main character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The setting shifts back to early 1970 in a Pennsylvania town where blacks and whites and Jews are separated, where there is an annual KKK march, where the Jews and blacks have sort of integrated, and where all the various dimensions of community are explored. Sounds like a book that our city might profit from reading, especially with the racist, white supremacist and antisemitic incidents—and the different responses they have generated, or not.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wonder it if would be possible simply to discuss the book without mentioning race, white supremacy or antisemitism, leaving the discussion solely under the category of hate. Interesting. I am thinking some people might be offended. How to handle that? Umm. (Don’t we live in interesting times!)&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for listening, I suppose to lose myself a little and since there has been some much to read about the circumstances in the Middle East and in Congress I gravitated toward an Open Source with Christopher Lydon podcast, “George Eliot’s Marriage Story,” following up on Clare Carilisle’s new book, “The Marriage Question: George Eliot’s Double Life.” I listed among my recent reading the review of the book in the New Yorker.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The listening provided great insight into a fabled writer’s life during times when women, especially ones who chose an alternate living arrangement, suffered. For those in the know, George Eliot was the pseudonym of Mary Ann&nbsp;Evans, and the author of such books as “Silas Marner,” “Adem Bede” and “Middlemarch.” Click <a href="https://radioopensource.org/george-eliots-marriage-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for the podcast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
