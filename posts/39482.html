<p>Come Sunday morning, things will have quieted down considerably from Christmas when we had a full house, ate pretty much everything and just had a great time. As I told Mary, it was as good as the day might be considering our cast of characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomorrow is a double celebration--a grandchild celebrates birthday No. 4 and we all celebrate the new year. Pretty auspicious, I'm saying. And don't spill the beans, but there is a Daniel Tiger cake (a creation of our own Bakery on Maple) to top things off.</p>

<p>Around the city, the news this week centered on the Board of Fire Commissioners along with its Firehouse 3 Building Committee, each having granted approval for Fire Chief Rick Hart to go ahead with requests to the Board of Finance for major improvements to the Bristol Fire Department. It is only a first step. We will be following developments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FYI--One of the requests has to do with amending the capital expense request for a new firehouse in Forestville and the other, funding to increase staffing, both of which contribute to Bristol becoming compliant with national fire and insurances standards.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week begins with a podcast posted Dec. 18 on The Gray Area, "Living Mindfully," featuring Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is one of the movers and shakers behind the mindfulness movement having published the book, "Wherever You Go, There You Are." The book is celebrating its 30th anniversary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The podcast covers a wide range of topics, from "what it means to be mindful in the attention economy ... and how to think about the commercialization of an ancient practice." Click <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/living-mindfully/id1081584611?i=1000638925263">here</a>.</p>

<p>Reading this week is from a book with a more than interesting title, "Everything is F*cked: A Book About Hope," by Mark Manson. Despite its scatological title--or perhaps because of it--the book is a worthwhile read, not only providing a commonsense guide to figuring out just how to stake out a purpose in life but for its attention to the psychological makeup of the human being.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heck, it's a not only a good introduction to psychology but to philosophy and religion. It even stakes out positions on the economy and politics. And it's all based on the latest brain science. And it's pretty hilarious, if you can step back from what might appear to be a verbal assault on many beliefs.</p>

This email newsletter typically arrives in your email between 1 and 2 p.m. If you are receiving individual emails, please email editor@bristoledition.org.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
