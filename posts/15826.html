<p>The one business that has taken one of the biggest hits during the global pandemic is the entertainment industry and, specifically, movie theaters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arguably, the movie theater industry was in a downward trend even before COVID-19 as streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and the like have kept families from going out to see major motion pictures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as big screen TVs have become common household items, the need to drag a family out to the movies&nbsp; - which includes the task of purchasing overpriced, but tasty, buttered popcorn and soda, and candy, and seconds on candy, and perhaps even a dinner at a restaurant that doesn’t start with the letters ‘Mc’ - has gone by the wayside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not including the price of the ticket just to get into the building!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But way before the global pandemic, we’ve all seen the rise and fall of movie theaters in and around New England.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about all the movies you’ve seen in theaters that are no longer in existence just in Connecticut alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember several movies I’ve seen over the years and recently wondered how many of those venues are still in existence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I picked a selection of movies I’ve enjoyed as a wee lad, including the location of the theater, a tidbit on what happened during the screening, and if the building is still standing as of 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s my list:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Chariots of Fire</strong> - Elm Theater, West Hartford (April 1982).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>Chariots was the first picture I saw in a movie theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember running around the venue before the presentation and my pops yelling at me to sit down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, they were going to be running around in the so why not run around the theater, too?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My pops did not like my logic…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>The location actually turned into a Walgreens right around 2005.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</strong> - Showcase Cinemas, East Hartford (July 1982).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>My ‘Papa’ took me, and it was a bit of a drive (people flocked to see the E.T. movie locally) so the movie, at least in and around Bristol, and was always packed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember eating plenty of popcorn before, during, and after the showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as an extra bonus, the E.T. video game made for Atari was one of the worst games of all time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>Toast. It closed due to the theater built near the Buckland Hills Mall area. It was torn down a couple years ago and a Burlington Coat Factory was constructed on that property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Return of the Jedi - </strong>Newington Cinemas (June 1983).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>Even a month after the release of the epic, the theaters were still packed with people flocking to see Darth Vader and his minions hanging out with the Emperor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember trying to find three seats in a row proving difficult that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People must have clapped and applauded about seven or eight times during the movie when seeing their favorite character for the first time (Lando Calrissian got a huge ovation), something unheard of today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>More toast. A Lowes Home Improvement store was constructed on the site and a Roy Rogers restaurant, a staple in Bristol for a time (think Caldor’s plaza, er, Bristol Commons), also closed on that same Newington property decades later. It was very sad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Karate Kid</strong> - Centre Mall Cinema, Bristol (June 1984).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>Located across from Bristol Center Mall, I spent several hours as a kid, taking in a movie on one of the two screens from that venue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, there was my Pops before the movie, telling me to sit down and threatened to take my candy away (he still says that to me in 2022…).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in those days, you’d go see a movie, shop at the Center Mall, get dinner, and make a real evening of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>A Bristol Health Medical Care Center is now on the property where the theater sat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>LionHeart - </strong>Waterbury Theater, next to the old Naugatuck Valley Mall (January 1991).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>I went there with my buddy Scott and his parents during my freshman year of high school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was my first rated ‘R’ movie experience in a theater, and I thought I was the man that night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And hey, it was Jean-Claude Van Damme for crying out loud, so you knew it was going to be good…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>The venue is still open! It’s called the Apple Cinemas Waterbury 10. It’s the only theater from this group of movie selections I picked that is still standing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Speed - </strong>Sony Movie Theater, Pine Street in Bristol (June/July 1994).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overview of the experience: </strong>You mean experiencesbecause I saw Speed at that venue four times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time I enjoyed Speed in that theater was the day I was awarded my Eagle Scout badge, hoping for a bit of a distraction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t work with star Keanu Reeves wildly screaming things like,<em>“There’s a bomb on your bus!” </em>and <em>“shoot the hostage.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if I could have, I would have seen the movie in Forestville for a fifth time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Building now: </strong>The structure is there still but it turned into a Subway and other businesses across from the Forestville Stop &amp; Shop.</p>
