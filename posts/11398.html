<p>NEWINGTON - The Newington girls basketball squad is one of the best programs in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the team start’s hitting shots from downtown, those 3-point bombs quickly add up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the first round of the Central Connecticut Conference girls basketball tournament on Thursday, the Nor’easters hit a barrage of 3s, saw balanced scoring inside and out to defeat Bristol Eastern by a 63-39 final from Newington high school.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington moved to 20-1 on the season while Eastern dropped to 8-12 but the program is looking forward to the Class L state tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington hit nine three-pointers in the game, five from freshman Bella Cucuta - leading the program with 22 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All-stater Lilly Ferguson kicked in 15 points, Kendall Miller added nine while Karissa Zocco scored six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Eastern, Ciara Collins notched a game-high 28 points, sinking nine field goals overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She canned two three-pointers and went a perfect 8-for-8 from the foul line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow senior Janessa Gonzalez scored nine points while Emma Stavens netted a hoop on a baseline shot to end the third quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one else scored a point for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four different players scored for Newington in the opening minutes of the game as the home team raced out to a 8-0 edge and never looked back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hoop by Collins at the 6:10 mark of the first period stopped the run but playing catch-up against Newington was going to be a tall order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ferguson had three hoops in the quarter while Cucuta and Marliese Zocco both flipped in two baskets - each canning a 3 along the way - as Newington scooped up a 21-14 lead after one frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins scored eleven of the Eastern’s 14 points in the period to keep the Lancers in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second stanza didn’t get much better as the Nor’easters outscored the Lancers 19-6 and etched up a twenty point lead by intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Cucuta scoring nine points in the second quarter, including two additional 3s, Newington opened up a 40-20 lead at the half.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both squad scored 11 points in the third tilt as the game was a 51-31 affair with eight minutes remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home team nailed four threes over the final half as the Lancers absorbed a tough 63-39 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>RIM DUST</strong>…It looks as if the Lancers will be ranked No. 21 in the Class L state tournament fray and will be forced to travel to Bethel (No. 12) in first round action. Stay tuned…</p>
