<p>BRISTOL - A big victory for the Bristol Eastern baseball team was somewhere on the horizon for the squad to end the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that win came on Friday night as the Lancers upended a very good squad from Hall of West Hartford - shutting out the team by a 9-0 decision from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a complete game effort by Eastern (7-10) as the program is on the cusp of a state tournament berth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall fell to 11-7 as the team saw its five-game winning streak snapped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything clicked for Eastern as the team had excellent pitching, saw timely hitting (14 hits), and played errorless ball to snare the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern junior righthander Mike Roalf was simply tremendous over the winning endeavor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He pitched a complete game gem, throwing 103 pitches, allowing just five hits, striking out ten, and walking just two.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern pounded out 14 hits in support of Roalf, scoring in each of the first three innings, as the Kingstreeters opened a 7-0 lead - never looking back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cole Latko scooped up three hits, scored twice, and tallied an RBI while Jaydon Churchill, Connor Cyr, Ben D'Amato, and Elliot Norris all had two hits. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill dropped in a fifth inning double to deep left while Cyr, Ryan Maglio, and D'Amato each tallied two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers scored twice in bottom of the first to square the game away in quick fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk to Conor McCormick opened the first inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then stole second, went to third on a passed ball, and scored on Connor Cyr's single between short and third. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr scored the second run of the frame as D’Amato hit a ball towards the middle of the infield which deflected off the pitcher's glove towards shortstop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No play was able to be made as the infield tally made it a 2-0 contest though one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall's only scoring chance came in the second but Roalf and the defense snuffed that drive right out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A walk, followed by a single, put two runners on with no outs for Hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runners moved up to second and third on a sacrifice bunt but Roalf retired the side from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A come-backer and a strikeout ended the threat and Hall never threatened again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Hall never had more than one baserunner on base in any inning with only one runner advancing past first base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers added three runs in the second as Latko singled past second base to start the inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris then laid down a perfect bunt on the third base side, beating it out for a hit and when Churchill's grounder was misplayed, Latko scored to make it a 3-0 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyr later singled to right center to score Norris and D'Amato's base hit up the middle plated Churchill as Eastern squared up a 5-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third tilt, following a walk to Rio Fernandez, Latko's single to right center scored Fernandez, and Norris again beat out a perfect bunt down the third base line to put two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a single to left by Churchill scored Latko as Eastern nabbed a 7-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The final two runs came in the fifth, started off by a McCormick single, and when Churchill unleashed a double, runners were on second and third. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Maglio then pinch hit for the Lancers, smacking the first ball he saw to center for a single and two RBI as Eastern squared up a 9-0 victory to get within a game of state tournament qualification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>This coming week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is scheduled for three games, starting with the city series confrontation against tournament bound Bristol Central (8-10) on Monday night from Muzzy Field at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Wednesday, the Lancers battle against Wethersfield on the road and host the Bulkeley/AAE/Bloomfield squad in a make-up showdown on Thursday from Clem J. Roy Field at BEHS to close out the regular season.</p>
