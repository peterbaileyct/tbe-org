<h2 class="wp-block-heading">revised version </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s new city hall is quite an improvement over the old one and a testament to the many people who have contributed to its planning and renovation over many years. The new entrance on North Main Street provides a welcome change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, of course, the building will now be a safer workplace, with the removal of poisonous paint and replacement of the old HVAC systems. We recommend attending the dedication ceremony and open house this coming Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shiny new building, however, must be received with some caveats. First among these is Bristol’s “hate” problem, now known state-wide. Rather than the Mum City’s reputation of growing and glowing, our reputation has taken a hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inventory of new buildings coming online downtown, again after years of negotiating and planning to get things moving to where several have broken ground–an achievement well worth celebrating–the gloss is already worn thin, and the city has fallen under the pall of hate, and rightly so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The political skirmishes over racism, white supremacy, and antisemitism is necessary. The Democrats are right to take issue with each ugly episode in the unfolding saga. These problems are difficult ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, as election day nears, other issues within the city need to be addressed. Single-issue elections, while energizing for one side over another, are not good for the city, nor for democracy, A robust discussion would be a welcome addition to the political discourse and help put the new “All-Heart” banner on city hall’s marquee not only in place but in practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise, we get more of the same, and the somber and serious attention to these issues gets stigmatized and dismissed under the category of crying wolf.</p>

<p>At the same time, they are ones that create opportunities for growth so that our accomplishments as a city can be highlighted. It might also be noted that these opportunities need to be expressed, clarified and promoted.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
