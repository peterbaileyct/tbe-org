<p>On Saturday, we posted a story that the Board of Education was eliminating gate fees for high school events, in athletics and the arts. We received an email that said the fee will still be charged for the Thanksgiving Day football game. </p>

<p><strong>TBE has since confirmed with Dr. Michael Dieter that our original story was correct. According to Dieter, “The Thanksgiving game was discussed, however, it was not addressed in the motion. The policy that was voted on does not include provisions or carve outs for the Battle for the Bell.”</strong> <br><strong>In effect, as originally reported, there will be no fee charged on Thanksgiving.</strong></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
