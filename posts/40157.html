<p>Since many people have the day off, let us have a short moment of silence for those at work.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">'I Have a Dream' nightmare</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963, he certainly never could have “dreamed” that 60 years later some yahoos in Bristol would have a "Keep CT White" rally on Pine Street. Someone is poking his friends in hell saying, “I told you our ideas have legs”? (Hint: initials are AH.)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weather</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Partly sunny, or maybe partly cloudy. High of 28. For at least one day, we can turn off our sump pumps.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Question of the day</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is midnight 12 a.m. or 12 p.m.? And to quote the classic rock band Chicago, “Does anybody really care?”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heads up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your trash will be collected one day later this week. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are welcome, Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
