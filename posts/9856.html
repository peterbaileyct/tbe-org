<p>The following is the entire response from Wheeler Clinic posted on their website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are disappointed and surprised at last night’s vote&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bristol&nbsp;City Council to&nbsp;reject the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the City of Bristol and Wheeler for our&nbsp;planned community health center&nbsp;and corporate headquarters at Centre Square.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more than a year, we have operated&nbsp;as partners with the city&nbsp;and its economic development team,&nbsp;in&nbsp;a good&nbsp;faith and patient process to both achieve our aspirational vision and the city’s&nbsp;economic development&nbsp;goals.&nbsp;To show our commitment to the project,&nbsp;in the last six months, we have spent considerable funds&nbsp;and time&nbsp;planning and&nbsp;performing the due diligence the city had required for the facility.&nbsp;We believed, and continue to believe, that our proposed project would&nbsp;help anchor downtown with needed services, as well as more than 200 professional&nbsp;clinical and administrative staff, who&nbsp;live in,&nbsp;shop&nbsp;and&nbsp;dine&nbsp;at, purchase from, and support the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we lost&nbsp;last night’s&nbsp;vote, we did not lose our commitment to Bristol. Our team operates in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10158049270712951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every Bristol public school</a>, every day, helping our kids with the profound mental health challenges that are so apparent today. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10157719603422951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community health centers</a>&nbsp;continue to serve thousands of Bristol residents, providing fully integrated primary and behavioral health care. We will still help anchor the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10154941509862951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockwell Park Summer Festival</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10158415629367951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless other community events</a>. We stood outside in the rain, in the snow, testing and vaccinating Bristol--including its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10157730456652951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first responders</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10158413391637951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its senior center</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10157493359862951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its housing authority</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10157764402752951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its residents</a>--through COVID. We have been, are, and will remain dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wheelerhealth/posts/10156589588872951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to&nbsp;a healthier Bristol</a>...All Heart.</p>

<p>We&nbsp;had&nbsp;planned this morning&nbsp;to announce that we have raised $270,000 in gifts and pledges toward&nbsp;construction costs for&nbsp;Wheeler’s future home in Bristol.&nbsp;These&nbsp;investments&nbsp;of support came from the community, our senior staff, and our Board of Trustees&nbsp;in a silent phase of a planned capital campaign, and we will continue to raise funds to support a new center in Bristol that meets our needs in ways that our current&nbsp;two health center&nbsp;facilities&nbsp;do not. We&nbsp;have outgrown them based on community need and demand for our services.&nbsp;Our work remains heavy,&nbsp;life-changing, and vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We would like to thank&nbsp;Mayor Caggiano and Councilman&nbsp;Panioto&nbsp;for their&nbsp;heartfelt,&nbsp;outspoken support of the agreement&nbsp;last night, and&nbsp;to&nbsp;the other members of the City Council for their consideration&nbsp;and focus.&nbsp;We would also like to thank the economic development team in the city.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, we&nbsp;are profoundly thankful to Tom Barnes, chairman of the board of the Barnes Group, for his vision, philanthropic generosity, and public support for our project.&nbsp;What Tom said&nbsp;at the meeting last night is&nbsp;public&nbsp;expression of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wheelerclinic.org/news/2019-news-archive/wire-spring-industry-ensures-care-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 50 years of Barnes support&nbsp;</a>for&nbsp;Wheeler's&nbsp;work, and we&nbsp;were honored&nbsp;to have&nbsp;him speak on our behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We look forward to continued dialogue with the&nbsp;city.&nbsp;</p>
