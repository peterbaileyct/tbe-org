<p>We in Bristol do not have the Mississippi. We don’t have the Hudson. We don’t have the Connecticut. We don’t even have the Farmington. But we do have the raging Pequabuck River, especially after the rains of the past few weeks.</p>

<p>The 30 second video above is our very own river in action at Rockwell Park. Do yourself a favor and take a walk along our river. It is a beautiful sight, and the sound of the rushing water could help the worst insomniac get a good night’s sleep. (Why does the sound stop halfway through? Because I am a technological marvel.)</p>

<p>When you go to Rockwell Park, tell them I sent you. They’ll probably let you hike for free. You’re welcome.</p>
