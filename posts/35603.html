<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Central football program (1-4 overall) might have hit the bye week like a brick wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the team plans to bounce-back over the second half of the season even through another slate of tough Central Connecticut Conference Tier II showdowns await.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, outside of Friday’s game coming up, the word "opportunity" should help propel the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is getting better as both the offenses and defenses continue to form, coalesce and gel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day and the same goes for the success of most scholastic football programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The passing game is still a work in progress as junior Jack Hartley (113 carries, 372 yards, two TDs) can run with the football here, there and everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those direct snaps don’t give a ton of time for Hartley to respond but if there’s any daylight, he’s off to the races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once that passing game falls into place, Hartley is going to be load to stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley leads the program with three rushing touchdowns while Jayden Glasper (39-149, TD), Tristian Thompson (25-124, two TDs) and Anthony Paulino (9-131, two TDs) have also chipped in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cassias Breland and Quincy Lawson have multiple receptions on the season with Hartley found Lawson for a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents haven’t had much success on the ground (692 total yards) compared to the Rams (880) but Central has been out gained overall due to the passing game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opposition have made over half of its throwing attempts (37-for-74) for 557 yards while the Rams have a combined 79 reception yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Central has been out gained offensively 1249-959.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Jack Jones continues to achieve as he’s belting out 11 tackles-per-game that includes eight tackle-for-a-loss - both team-leading totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Ryan has continued to gain success, squaring up 35 total tackles - good for 7.0 tackles-per-game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lamarre (29 tackles, 5.8 per game), Tim Sample (22 tackles, 4.4 tackles-per-game), along with Glasper (3.6 tackles-per-game) help lead the defense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luis Padilla has six tackles-for-losses as 67-percent of his stops results in a loss by the opponent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tashawn Cauley, Ayden Pratt and Lawson all have wrangled up sacks while Lamarre have two interceptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawson and Lopez have one pickoff apiece to keep the defense humming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central’s last five games will go much better than the first five&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is some good news about the remainder of Central’s schedule and it’s possible the outfit could go 4-1, or better, over the second five-pack of gridiron contests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The five team's Central squads square off against are a combined 9-14 (.391 winning percentage), giving the Rams a little confidence about the second half of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three games will be contested from Bristol while squaring off at Manchester this Friday (3-1 overall) and then on Nov. 10, the Rams are off to Newington (1-4) who still could be stuck on one victory come the showdown versus Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those home games will be contested against Wethersfield (Oct. 27), Middletown (Nov. 2) and of course, the Thanksgiving Day clash against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are wins to be had as Wethersfield (0-5) has yet to snare a victory while always challenging Middletown (1-4) has fallen on hard times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are currently 4-1 and, frankly, are going to be a tough out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, on Thanksgiving, anything is possible as you throw out the records when the two squads clash.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
