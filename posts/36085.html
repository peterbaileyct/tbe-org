<p>MANCHESTER - The Bristol Central football squad hung around against Manchester early in its CCC Tier II showdown on the road on Friday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading just 9-7 through one frame, the Red Hawks scored 19 straight points over the second and third quarters to eventually help square up a 42-13 victory over the Rams in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Hawks moved to 4-1 overall while the Rams fell to 1-5 off the bye week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Hartley led the Central offense with 44 yards on 20 carries while also making a couple passes for 36 yards, Donovan Rodriguez added 46 yards on six carries while Jayden Clasper tallied 40 yards on nine carries and a touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aiden Lamarre, Anthony Paulino, Ty Chasse, Cassias Breland and Tristian Toussaint all made carries for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quincy Lawson nabbed a pass for 30 yards, Lamarre added one for six and Paulino zipped off a five-yard pass to Rodriguez for a touchdown reception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four interceptions and a lost fumble doomed the visiting outfit as the Red Hawks took advantage of several Central miscues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had two punts that combined for negative yardage, but the program managed 11 first downs to Manchester’s nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manchester quarterback Emanuel Sampel posted 10 passes for 167 yards and a TD while his running backs shared the ball to tally three scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Julian Henderson scooped up 55 yards on six carries while teammate Xavier Rodriguez added 50 yards on six rushes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nasir White nabbed two receptions for 75 yards and a touchdown and Joe Mugovero scooped in six passes for 51 yards.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central trailed by just two points through 12 minutes of action but allowed two touchdowns over second period play to trail 21-7 at the break.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were outscored 21-6 the rest of the way to absorb a tough 29-point decision with four games left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are home next week in a CCC Tier II showdown against Wethersfield on Oct. 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles have yet to win a game this season and the Rams should be primed and ready for this one.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
