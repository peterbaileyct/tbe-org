<p>BRISTOL - Before the Bristol Central softball team starts to prepare for the CIAC Class LL tournament fray, there’s a little bonus for the Rams to enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals, once again, qualified for the CCC Tournament as the top eight teams in the league will go to battle – with the possibility of two teams getting an extra three games to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s all house money because instead of a bit of a layoff, Central will be competing in meaningful, playoff tests for the second straight year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In the beginning of the season, we knew that we wanted to get a single digit seed in the states and we wanted to get a game in the CCC Tournament,” said Central coach Monica Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all that hard work paid off for Central (No. 5, 17-3) as the squad gets a rematch against No. 4 Hall in West Hartford today at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a showdown between squads that have already competed against one another this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on April 28, Hall’s Sophie Garner-MacKinnon and Central’s Alex Sciarretto combined on a seven-hitter that included 29 total strikeouts as two of the very best pitchers in the CCC went at it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But mistakes cost the Rams the game as the locals fell by a 2-1 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Garner-MacKinnon scoped up 18 strikeouts, sending down 10 of the first 11 batters she faced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sciarretto was just as sharp on that cold afternoon, posting 11 strikeouts and giving up just four hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, that’s in the past as Central looks to upset West Hartford on the road and if the Rams advance, a Wednesday challenge against top-ranked Southington could be in the cards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just qualifying for this tournament is a big deal and shows the growth of the one of the CCC’s up and coming programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s an awesome accomplishment,” said Hayes of qualifying for the CCC Tournament. “I love that tournament. It’s available now and I love how they’ve offered that starting last year. That was a big accomplishment last year when we made the first conference tournament ever.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And we want to win a game again.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a strong line-up of CCC teams as programs with at least 15 victories or more qualified.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seedings were based upon each team’s CCC regular season results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Year</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central, at 14-3, earned the sixth seed in the tournament fray in 2021 – the first year the CCC’s were held – and squared off against No. 3 Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams pulled off a 14-0 upset back on May 27 and the following day, against powerful Southington, Central fell 13-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2021, Berlin was the top program in CCC Tournament play while Southington earned the No. 2 ranking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs were 19-1 as the Knights are one season later. Southington did not lose a CCC game this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The 2022 set-up</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The postseason tournament will be played over three of the next four days, weather permitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quarterfinals commence on Tuesday, May 24 – from the site of the higher seed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday, it’s semifinal round action and the finals will be held on Friday, May 27 from the Dunn Sports Complex in Meriden.</p>
