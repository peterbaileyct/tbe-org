<p><strong>The Giamatti Men</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all remember A. Bartlett Giamatti who died suddenly at age 51 in 1989. He was the commissioner of baseball for whom the Eastern Regional Little League site here is named. This came after stints in other important activities.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He wasn't the lone family member to find success at a high level. His actor son, Paul, has also done well. I see that he is up for an Academy Award this year. Father and son becoming successful in different venues.</p>

<p>Here are locals whose names or nicknames rhyme: Alex, Dex, Lex, Mex, Rex and Tex. There are other words with these names within them: Texaco, Mexico, Middle Sec (County). Some folks have a hex on them.</p>

<p><strong>Dino Devino</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dean Nocera left Bristol years ago for a singing career, using the name of Dino Devino. He once sang at the Copacabana. He passed away in recent weeks at age 84. His sister, Diane Nocera, five years younger, also pursued a singing career in The Big Apple. I've been told she is now retired and residing in Florida.</p>

<p><strong>Bristol Stomp</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When this song came out, I was likely a teenie-bopper. Later I heard it referred to Bristol, PA. Funny thing, our Bristol was, and remains, the highest populated Bristol city, town, township or whatever, in the good old U.S.A. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe it was Bristol, PA, because of Philadelphia and the "Dick Clark Show?" Anyway, we had our own "Pop" parties and "Battles of the Bands." We "rocked: then, and still do!</p>
