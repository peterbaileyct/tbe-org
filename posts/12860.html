<p>One of the reasons TBE asks so little from its supporters, from $6 to $20 a month, compared to what other news operations charge, is that we believe that our news should be available to as many people as possible. The more people who sign on, the better we can do our job of covering the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, many supporters means that people understand our mission and think it's important enough to be a part of the solution of community news rather than leaving it up to someone else to solve. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, with a couple thousand people supporting us (ideally 5,000), we would have the resources to cover Bristol in a way that might appear impossible for any commercial news venue to cover because of their financial entanglements--ultimately, a commercial operation is beholden to its shareholders rather than its readers. And while, none of here at TBE begrudge anyone from making money, we believe that journalism and news is a service rather than a profit center.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine regular daily reports of decisions coming out of (or being considered by) City Hall. Imagine the stories that are happening now in our schools, businesses, nonprofits, neighborhoods. And of course, that is not all, how about coverage of the arts and, in particular, sports. This might all become possible through the support of a community that understands and is willing to back a winning proposition.</p>

<p>Yes, there are benefits to having a few big donors, who of course would be welcomed (note: we continue to work on our 501(c)(3) applicaiton; this status will provide tax benefits to people who qualify), so, yes, there are benefits of having big-dollar donors, and yet here at TBE we like the idea that more supporters means more voices when it comes to our story selection and accountability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Compare TBE with other news venues, beginning with their set rates, and you get a picture of how an efficient nonprofit outfit can provide great coverage for a reasonable contribution. And then, there is the added benefit from a nonprofit of our accountability. All of our financial reporting will be available online as will our board members, meetings and board decisions.</p>

<p>A few thousand supporters, begins with a couple hundred, a couple hundred begins with 10s, and 10s begins with one. Would you be that one? Click <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/">here</a> to go our home page and from there click on the "Become a Member" button.</p>
