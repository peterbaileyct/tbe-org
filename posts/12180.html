<p>It is not unusual to come across the phrase, "responsibly sourced food." It makes sense that something that sustains us needs to be sustained itself. That wild caught Atlantic salmon has to be able to reproduce and it can only do that if we recognize our responsibility for the proper circumstances that must exist for their flourishing. We know this today, but that wasn't always the case. It took and it takes effort on our part to acknowledge this--along with a willingness to pay a few more bucks for it. But we get it.</p>

<p>News, especially local news, has been and is undergoing the same type of shift. We are learning that it requires the same recognition and care--and a different business model to ensure that it meets the needs of the community it serves. That means readers need to acknowledge their role in its success. A nonprofit, the business model TBE has chosen, is another integral component of this new news environment. In other words, we are in this together--and we can flourish together by supporting each other.</p>
