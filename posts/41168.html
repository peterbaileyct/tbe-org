<p>As I pulled into the Bristol Senior Center parking lot to attend the Jan. 11 pasta supper fundraiser, the mayor of Bristol, Jeff Caggiano, was exuberantly walking out with his arms full of take-out pasta, sauce and meatballs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside I purchased a ticket for just $8 to enjoy a sit-down meal with salad, pasta, sauce, meatballs and a homemade cupcake of my choice. (Take-out is also available along with a chance to purchase sauce or meatballs separately for $10.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The homemade taste is prominent and immediately reminds me of my Grandma Angelina's spaghetti and meatball homemade meal.</p>

<p>Deborah Parent and Vito Montelli do an incredibly organized and efficient job of cooking and serving dinner for the Bristol community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It is such a great thing to do!" Â I commented.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We want to give back." Deborah said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Whose idea was it?" I asked Jason Krueger, the executive director of the Bristol Senior Center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was Vito's idea," Jason said. "He also runs the pasta supper at St. Ann's church in Bristol."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Is the senior center fundraiser successful?" I asked Jason.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is successful. It raises between $500 and $1,000 for the center every supper," Jason answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pasta fundraiser is four times a year, every three months, from 4:30 to 6 p.m. The next one is coming up in April.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families or singles can enjoy a homemade meal for a great cause: a happy and productive senior center. <em>Mange</em>!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
