<p>Come Sunday morning, the sun will have arrived. Saturday, one of the carwashes on Farmington Avenue had each of its parking spots by the vacuum cleaners filled and a continuous line of cars in the line for a wash. If ever there is a sign that things are looking up, weather-wise, it has to be this.</p>

<p>Unless of course you bank on Punxsutawney Phil, or even Connecticut's own, Chuckles, both of whom left their burrows, indicating a short winter. Either way, fingers crossed, we'll be here to see what happens.</p>

<p>Mary and I will have attended Hartford Stage's latest production on Friday evening. "Simona's Search" is 90-minutes and a whirlwind of a production covering trauma, both in the lives of parents and their children. More specifically, the drama explores the phenomenon of how children suffer the effects of trauma without having been exposed to it directly but through their DNA, something science now acknowledges.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week begins with a podcast, "How to be a Supercommunicator with Charles Duhigg," an episode from Intelligence Squared. The Pulitzer prize-winning author of "The Power of Habit" is joined by physicist and oceanographer Helen Czerski, a writer and science communicator. Click <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/how-to-be-a-supercommunicator-with-charles-duhigg/id708371900?i=1000643384897">here</a>. </p>

<p>For reading, I am making my way through "Ida: A Sword Among Lions," about Ida B. Wells. It's a big book with a big subject. Wells, who was born into slavery, became an investigative journalist who documented lynchings in the United States and advocated for women's rights. She is one of the founders of the NAACP.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, I picked up a few books at Worthwhile Reads, Bristol's new bookstore, which opens periodically and happened to have been open last Sunday. A report will be forthcoming. In the meantime, I purchased "The Trial of Socrates" by I.F. Stone and "Commentaries on Living" by J. Krishnamurti. </p>

<p>Stone is the muckraking journalist whose major contribution was his I.F. Stone's Weekly, which was highly influential and counted among its readers Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell and Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Krishnamurti is the Indian philosopher, teacher and spiritual figure, whose videos can be found on YouTube. I learned about him from a high school friend and find myself going back to his writing time after time.</p>

<p>We are glad to be doing what we can to cover what is happening locally, and grateful for those who support our efforts. As we attract more supporters, we will be covering more of the city–and developing a corps of reporters who we can pay for their services. </p>

<p>We encourage young people from our community, who have an interest in telling Bristol stories and improving their skills to do this. If you are one of these people, or know of one, please contact <a href="http://dfortier@bristoledition.org./">dfortier@bristoledition.org.</a></p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
