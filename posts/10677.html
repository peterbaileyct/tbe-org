<p>One project on the horizon was mentioned during the town meet and greet for District 3 in the basement meeting room of the Manross Library in Forestville.</p>

<p>“We’re talking about (providing) studio space, metal working space, tons of opportunity for artisans, craftsmen, all of them to come in with their own studio,” said Kenneth Lundquist Jr., chief creative consultant of <a href="https://business.facebook.com/pg/WulfLynx/posts/?business_id=10152592499697447">WULFLYNX Studios</a> and on the board of the <a href="https://www.bristolacf.org/">Bristol Arts &amp; Culture</a> fund.</p>

<p>The meet and greet was held Wednesday, Jan. 12. For the meeting story, <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/labor-agreement-wheeler-clinic-decisions-bring-residents-to-district-3-meet-and-greet/">click here.</a></p>

<p>“It's called the creative Co Op center and that's a real project,” Lundquist said. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he was working in cooperation with the owner of the old Bristol Press building for downtown development with an arts project that would be a major boost in the revitalization of downtown.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lundquist said he had four meetings this week with architects and the owner of the building to finalize their plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lundquist, who is a Bristol Central graduate and has travelled the world for the past 20 years, recently came back to take care of some family things and decided to stay at the request of many people throughout the community.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm actually doing many different projects here in person,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He mentioned a paver project as part of the new magnet school at Memorial Boulevard. The City Arts &amp; Culture Commission also have the <a href="https://www.theriseupgroup.org/mlk39">MLK39</a> mural project coming soon and the arts and culture district, which can be found on its <a href="https://www.bristolct.gov/938/City-Arts-Culture-Commission">website.</a></p>

<p>“I still appreciate everything here; I'm also of the hard-working middle-class folk of Bristol,” Lundquist said, before adding, “We need all of this because it's so important for the future.”</p>
