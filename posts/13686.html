<p>While the nation grapples with two mass shootings within the past two weeks and Covid numbers slowly&nbsp;projecting upward, the business of the city of Bristol continued last Wednesday night with a Charter Revision meeting in the&nbsp;basement of the Bristol Public Library.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the&nbsp;backdrop&nbsp;firmly established&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Charter Revision Committee&nbsp;feeling the pinch to complete their work, charter commissioners&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;increasing the mayor's term&nbsp;from two years to four years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Differing legal opinions exist, but Bristol could lose its recall capabilities in the charter if voters approve the term change in November.&nbsp;Therefore, to address those concerns and protect the city in the event of criminal behavior from an elected or an appointed official, the&nbsp;commission also voted that the city council develop&nbsp;language within the city ordinances&nbsp;to include&nbsp;the&nbsp;removal&nbsp;of elected and appointed&nbsp;officials who engage in criminal behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is worth noting that since the adoption of Bristol's charter,&nbsp;which was created in&nbsp;1911, it&nbsp;has never utilized&nbsp;the recall provision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the four-year term and a town manager proposal have been considered&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;times over&nbsp;six&nbsp;decades, and have been repeatedly rejected by voters, and&nbsp;then risen&nbsp;from the dead like Lazarus of Bethany. So this is not&nbsp;the first&nbsp;time the four-year term&nbsp;has awakened from the tomb.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2010, the&nbsp;matter&nbsp;was soundly scuttled&nbsp;on the ballot&nbsp;by voters 11,405 to 5,073.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And last year, the measure was proposed&nbsp;and debated by the&nbsp;committee&nbsp;but&nbsp;did not survive&nbsp;their deliberations&nbsp;when&nbsp;it&nbsp;became ensnarled in issues beyond their scope. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Few community members advocated for its passage during the previous go-around under Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.&nbsp;But both Zoppo-Sassu and her soon-to-be opponent Jeff Caggiano supported the change to a four-year term at that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the committee's&nbsp;deliberations last year, the commissioners sought and received input from previous&nbsp;occupants of the&nbsp;Mayor's&nbsp;office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seven&nbsp;former&nbsp;Bristol&nbsp;mayors&nbsp;were contacted,&nbsp;and four responded, two&nbsp;democrats&nbsp;and two republicans.&nbsp;All four&nbsp;mayors&nbsp;recommended keeping&nbsp;the two-year term.&nbsp;Their responses are below and edited for punctuation where necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michael J.&nbsp;Werner&nbsp;(R)&nbsp;1977-June 1984</strong> - "I'd also leave the&nbsp;Mayor&nbsp;with a two-year term. A two-year term keeps you on your toes. You don't have time to be complacent. Again, it's worked this long; I don't think it needs fixing."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>John&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Leone, Jr.&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;1984- April 1991</strong> - As for the&nbsp;Mayor serving two-year terms,&nbsp;it could handicap (especially a newly elected mayor) in getting their projects completed and programs implemented, but the two-year term does give the electorate the opportunity to review the&nbsp;Mayor'saccomplishments and report out their verdict.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Art Ward&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;2007-2013</strong> -"The present system of adequate checks and balances has proven effective,&nbsp;and I can't remember&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when a situation could not be addressed sufficiently."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>William&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Stortz&nbsp;(R)&nbsp;April 1991-1993, 2005-2007</strong> - “Stay with two-year terms!!!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly,&nbsp;in this year’s deliberations, supporters suddenly and dramatically appeared out of the woodwork with the change in administrations.&nbsp;Why&nbsp;many of&nbsp;these&nbsp;people&nbsp;were invisible&nbsp;and&nbsp;mute&nbsp;on the&nbsp;subject&nbsp;just&nbsp;last year&nbsp;is unknown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should&nbsp;voters&nbsp;approve this measure, Bristol will join&nbsp;a cadre of&nbsp;other towns&nbsp;with four-year terms for mayor, including&nbsp;but not limited to Bridgeport, Hartford, Norwalk, and&nbsp;Torrington.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Other&nbsp;noted&nbsp;changes&nbsp;</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Charter Revision Commission also recommended including&nbsp;the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Increase&nbsp;The board of finance from eight to 11 members.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Increase&nbsp;the city council from six to nine members with multiparty representation. Each party will have no more than two candidates for the city’s three districts, and the top three vote-getters in each district shall be elected. This ensures that one seat in each district will go to  the minority party.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>City council districts&nbsp;to be created by the registrars of voters rather than through the public process of the charter revision procedure.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;committee has not completed&nbsp;its&nbsp;work.&nbsp;Their next meeting is June 7,&nbsp;and a draft of their&nbsp;report to the City Council is due June 24.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the city council approves&nbsp;the committee's recommendations, the&nbsp;measures&nbsp;will be on the ballot in November for the approval or rejection of the voters.</p>
