<h3>Bristol flashback</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 1920 Civic Planning Proposal for Bristol, as prepared by John Nolen of Cambridge, Mass., states the following with regard to expressions of civic pride:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One judges a city as an individual by the expression in deeds and works of its inner spirit. Bristol has reached the point where it should awaken and show to the world that it has ideals above those of common necessities and higher than the mere earning of a livelihood.

Not only will the people of Bristol benefit and obtain a higher standard of citizenship and community life, but such a spirit will attract better and more desirable newcomers.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
