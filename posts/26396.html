<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern baseball squad put up a five-spot during second inning play on Monday during its CCC South bout against Newington but simply couldn’t hang on to any lasting momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Newington reliver Sam Drozd threw 5.1 frames of shutout ball as the Lancers fell by a 9-6 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’easters moved to 12-3 overall while the Lancers fell to 4-11 with five games left to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers jumped out to a 6-2 advantage after two innings of action, only to see Newington come back with seven unanswered runs over the remainder of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington scored two runs, without the benefit of a hit, in the top of the first off Eastern starter Anthony Nocera who did not factor into the ultimate decision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first two batters reached on a hit by pitch and a walk, respectively, with one run scoring on a sacrifice fly and another on an infield error to make it a 2-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got one back in the bottom of the first as consecutive one-out singles by Connor Cyr, Ben D'Amato, and Ryan Maglio loaded the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A base-on-balls to Rio Fernandez scored Cyr made it a 2-1 game through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’easters were held scoreless in the second stanza while the Kingstreeters went on the attack in the bottom of the tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three consecutive singles by Caleb Molinsky, Isaac Roberge, and Kyle Babin (team leading three hits) loaded the bases.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White's grounder to shortstop led to a fielder’s choice, with everyone safe and scoring Molinsky to knot things up at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington starter Gavin Gray retired the next two batters before a Maglio walk forced in a run while Fernandez was plunked by a pitch – for an RBI tally – to make it a 4-2 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a two run double off the bat of Harris propelled Eastern to a 6-2 cushion before Drozd relieved Gray to generate the final out of the frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drozd then pitched five scoreless innings in relief, allowing just four hits, striking out eight, and kept Eastern off the scoreboard for the remainder of the encounter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington picked up two runs in the third, a couple more in the fourth to tie the game, and then added three runs in the sixth, off a trio of Lancer pitchers, to go on to the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Owen Myers drew the loss for the Lancers while Johnny Montgomery allowed no hits over his two-inning stint, tallying four strikeouts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, which had eleven hits for the game, jammed out seven over the first two frames to grab that four-run edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris and Ben D’Amato each nabbed two to help Eastern’s offensive attack.</p>
