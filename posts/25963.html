<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s time to play the game on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the biggest regular season showdown Bristol will see in the city this year, the Bristol Central softball team will host undefeated Southington (11-0) in a CCC interdivisional extravaganza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 4:45 p.m. from the softball field from Bristol Central High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battle is going to be an event you simply can’t miss between two of the top-five programs in Connecticut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Respect BC</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hear about Southington all the time through various media sources and the like.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And most of the talk on the scholastic softball front is about someone other than Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hear about Newtown, Masuk, Woodland and Southington far too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams from Bristol deserve and command the same respect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a team that’s currently 12-0 with a boatload of talent at tis disposal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about Bristol Central?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can pick up a huge victory over the Knights, the talk is about to change in a major way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Defense has fueled both teams in 2023</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams have combined to give up a total of 11 runs this season, very few of them earned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only Newington and Bristol Eastern have been able to tally multiple runs against Central - scoring twice against the Rams over tough losses.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Central’s last eight games, opponents are averaging 0.5 runs-per-game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that same stretch, the Knights have given up only three runs for an average of 0.4 runs-an-outing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense will be key in this one on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>One and done between the squads?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were an outstanding 22-5 last season with three of those setbacks coming against the Knights, including the final game of the Class LL championship in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And unless the squads square off in the CCC Tournament (wink, wink), this will be the only time this season Central and Southington will battle each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2023, the Rams are right where they should be in Class L while the Knights still compete in Class LL and defend that championship when the postseason rolls around.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who does Central put on the mound against Southington?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you have two NCAA Division I pitchers at your disposal, there isn’t any wrong answer on who Central head coach Monica Hayes puts in the circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophia&nbsp;Torreso and Alex Sciarretto are both bulldogs from the rubber and yet to taste defeat - carrying an ERA of less than 0.40.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Southington pitching is equally as impressive, those two studs from Bristol don’t know the word quit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either choice is correct and Torreso or Sciarretto are capable of handing Southington its first loss of the campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget, the duo has somewhere around 140 strikeouts for the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not chump change.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget Lorelei Stancavage behind the dish, catching for those outstanding pitchers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That battery is one of the best in the state, period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central has some pop in the lineup</strong>…&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just think about the top five the Rams employ in the batting order.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaley Laird is a human jumping jack with enough energy to keep the power in Bristol up and running over the next 50 years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird leads off, small ball specialist Sam Sklenka bats second while sister Leah Sklenka, ready to hit the ball into the outfield, hits third for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then throw in Sciarretto and Torreso over the next couple slots in the order and you can see how potent the lineup is over just the first five.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That crew is just talented defensively at it is offensively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Knights on the mound</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And who makes the start for the Knights in the circle?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will it be Stella Blanchard?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point this year, she carried a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 31-to-1. That’s big-time stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad was batting right round .400 after four games this season and has not relented.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There aren’t any easy answers around here when dealing with Southington.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The class of the CCC</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are only two teams undefeated in the CCC – Bristol Central and Southington.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And those programs have a one-game lead over the rest of the squads in the conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the Rams and the Knights, Windsor is the next best program at 12-2 while surprising Plainville also carries the same ledger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tolland (10-2) is just a game behind the Windsor/Plainville contingent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Windsor fell to Southington (10-1) back on April 17 while Plainville dropped a tough 13-1 decision to Central on April 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between Central and Southington, both top-five ranked programs in the state, who is truly better than that CCC duo?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>State Tournament Rankings</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Class LL rankings, Southington is rated second behind undefeated Newton (14-0).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fairfield Warde (14-1) is currently in third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at the Class L rankings, North Haven (15-0) is in first place while the Rams (12-0) are in second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Masuk is hanging tough in third place with a record of 14-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Must see affair&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This game against Southington is for the taking by Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A victory by the Rams over the Knights will shake up the state rankings in Connecticut.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no matter how things go down, this showcase event is a must see for event for anyone who loves the sport of softball.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, the one thing you can bank on, is that the energy is about to shift…</p>
