<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GMB election poll</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A recent GMB election survey shows 70 percent of election deniers lodged near Tory’s Den believe Trump will win if the election is not stolen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>50 percent of the 70 percent felt "mostly upset" with the opinion poll. 20 percent thought the question “Who are you voting for?” was biased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, 60 percent of 2016 disgruntled Bernie supporters who are living under the bridge in Forestville and are on a strict diet of granola bars and packets of herbal tea are only voting so they get a voting sticker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>70 percent of those respondents who identify themselves as “women” and are 2016 Bernie supporters said Harris will win if she gets more electoral votes unless she doesn’t then she won’t win. 10 percent of the 70 percent who did not complete the entire survey had no opinion.</p>
