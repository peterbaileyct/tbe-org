<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team completed a season sweep over BC Friday night at Bristol Eastern's Alumni Field while also celebrating senior night. The 15-4 win for the Lancers came after some time was spent celebrating the following seniors and their families: Megan Krok, Vanessa Drury, Emma Stavens, Gabby McLay, and Jayna Hatcher.</p>

<p>The Lancers quickly got on the board on a goal by Vanessa Drury. She displayed a great hesitation move that put Central's defense to sleep momentarily and then blasted a shot. Central answered with a goal by Kaylynn Lapointe. The Lancers then went on a three-goal explosion by Emma Stavens, Harper Dauphinee and Leah Roy.Â </p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
