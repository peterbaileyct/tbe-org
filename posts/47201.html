<p>An American flag retirement ceremony will be held at American Legion Post 2 today, Saturday, June 15, at 11 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 6,500 American flags were replaced at area cemeteries in Bristol and Forestville with this past Memorial Day with the help of the Bristol Veterans Council and its many volunteers, according to Post 2 historian Neal Supranovich.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The flags that were removed, among other flags that residents have donated, will be retired in the ceremony. Old American flags will be accepted for retirement the morning of the ceremony.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The event will take place at the picnic area behind the American Legion Hall on Hooker Court. Members of scout groups will be on hand to assist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The flag replacement was made possible, in part, with one-time donation from the city of Bristol. The BVC raises funds each year for the changing out of flags.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
