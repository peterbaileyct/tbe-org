<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>July was jammed packed with Go Fest and new Pokémon to catch! I wanted to slow it down just a bit and bring you up to date with the events happening in Bristol for Pokémon Go in August.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pokémon GO’s Community Day August 2024 features Popplio, the Sea Lion Pokémon! Players have the chance to encounter Shiny Popplio in the wild. Popplio Community Day takes place on Saturday, Aug. 31, from 2 to 5 p.m. It can be caught as a shiny version, and it’s a great way to level up and update your Pokedex.</p>

<p>Finally, I have two big Elite Raid Boss updates! For those that had issues with this one the last time, Mega Rayquaza, a special global makeup event will be held for all Trainers on Saturday, Aug. 3, at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. Defeat Mega Rayquaza in an Elite Raid, and you’ll earn an opportunity to catch Rayquazatwo</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Saturday, the highly anticipated Mega Lucario is finally making its debut in Pokémon GO in its Ultra Unlock: Raid Day on July 27, and can be tackled with two to four high level trainers. To get Mega Lucario, you will need 200 Mega Energy for the initial evolution, then 40 Mega Energy to evolve the same Lucario again in the future. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mega Energy can be obtained in these Raids, and once you have evolved Mega Lucario, you can earn five Mega Energy per candy while walking it as your buddy. You can walk any Riolu or Lucario to earn Mega Energy if you have previously evolved one to register it to your Mega Pokédex.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em></p>
