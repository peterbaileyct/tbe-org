<p>PLAINVILLE - In a battle against always pesky Plainville on Wednesday night, the Bristol Central wrestling program was able to grapple its way to a big 48-26 victory in a CCC South encounter from the Kegel Gymnasium on the campus of Plainville High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (7-1) has been on a roll this year - losing just once along the way in a heartbreaker against Berlin - and earned its first CCC South victory against the Blue Devils.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plainville dropped to 11-5 overall (0-2 CCC South) in the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s entire line-up battled throughout as Plainville put up excellent resistance over several bouts but still fell in the end.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 106 pounds, Central’s Engher Disla-Almonte ended up winning by forfeit and Kaden Dragon (113) absolutely blitzed Plainville’s Greyson Borra.</p>

<p>Dragon battered Borra for a huge technical fall decision over his 20-5 triumph.</p>

<p>In the 120-pound showdown, the Ram’s Joseph Niek got by Eli Benoit over a 10-9 decision and Julian Colon (126) pinned Plainville’s Kali Fangiullo for the win.</p>

<p>Central’s Kyle Romann (132) did not have an opponent to face but at 145, Landon Dionne was ready for battle.</p>

<p>He ended up pinning Bartlomiej Powala in just over a minute on the mats (1:02) in the first period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ Lincoln Archibald (152) pinned Charlie Hall while Central teammate Ayden Pratt (170) earned a 12-3 major decision over the Blue Devils’ Hunter Krystock.</p>
