<p>Of the two Bristol cheer squads competing at the regionals at the University of New Hampshire, Sunday, the younger D-8 team secured a first-place finish, starting the day with a strong performance, and advanced to American Football and Cheer National Competition in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hundreds of cheer families and fans gathered with their eyes on the prize--hoping to place in the top three for their respective divisions with the desire to advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The older D-14 team pulled together and strongly executed a newly put together routine, but fell short, ending their season earlier than hoped for despite their tremendous effort and hard work.Â </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season ending conclusion marks the end of a memorable town cheer career for several of the D14- 8th graders who will find themselves moving onto high school next year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The coaches and their teammates extended a heartfelt thank you to cheerleaders: Leianna VanBeveren; Leila Plourde; Kelsie Ward; Lillian Cloutier; and Jemma Almodovar and their families for the fierce dedication, hardwork and support over the years. </p>

<p>They wished the veterans the best and encouraged them to remember their accomplishments over their careers.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
