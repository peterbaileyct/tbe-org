<p>The annual event has for its primary benefactor the St. Vincent DePaul Society, a non-profit that provides shelter, food, counseling and referral services for people in need. The society operates a 25-bed homeless shelter, a 10-family Women with Children Transitional Center and a 13-unit transitional living center for single men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year's event raised $6,000 for the shelter, while raising awareness for the society. Since the race began in 2003, it has raised over $190,000 for the shelter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to benefiting St. Vincent DePaul, the run will again offer a $1,000 grant to the Cover, a center for grieving children.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
