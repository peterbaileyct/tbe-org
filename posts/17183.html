<p>MERIDEN - While the Bristol Eastern football program spotted Platt 22 points in its Central Connecticut Conference inter-tier showdown on Friday night, the locals simply refused to yield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After not scoring over first half play, the Kingstreeters reeled off 14 third period points in a matter of 2:36 and quickly, it was a game again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Panthers managed to stay one score ahead the rest of the way, hanging on to seize a 29-22 victory from Falcon Field in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt (1-1) won for the first time while Eastern (0-2) lost its second game this season by a single possession.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We spurted a little bit in the first half,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “We just had a couple bad breaks.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had two 10-play drives in the first half that didn’t produce a score while Platt rode the arm of quarterback Avery Robinson (13-of-16, 190 yards, two touchdowns) to stay ahead of the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Eastern came up dry on its opening double-figure play drive, Platt went 85 yards on nine plays as Robinson found Kevin Acosta for a six-yard TD reception as the home team led 7-0 with 2:34 left in the first quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a three and out by Eastern, a botched punt attempt saw kicker Gavin Damboise, who valiantly went after the ball, ended up tackled in the end zone - resulting in a safety as the Panthers led 9-0 with 90 seconds to go in the first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the free kick, Robinson eventually ran the ball in for a 12-yard score and with 9:34 remaining before the half, Eastern fell behind 16-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers defense perked up, led by a couple tackles for losses by Eastern senior Austin Shorette, and Platt was held to just six points over the ensuing 18 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Zavecz also made big tackles to help slow the Platt offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A promising Eastern drive was foiled in the second period when Jack Hartley (two catches, 24 yards) made a quick reception at the Platt 15. But the ball slipped away from Hartley and Platt nabbed the pigskin - ending the Lancers best scoring chance over the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a great scramble and the ball just kind of pops up in the air and Platt capitalized on it,” said Julius of the turnover. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one play later, off a huge 61-yard Platt reception, the ball was fumbled and Eastern’s Zaveyn Tate pounced it as the Panthers were also stopped in the red zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a three and out, Platt had a short field as Corey Rogers made a five yard TD plunge into the goal as Platt scooped up a 22-0 cushion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern did not score over its final drive of the half as the Panthers held an imposing lead going into intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We went into the locker room [and] the kids were still positive,” said Julius. “They felt like they were right there, and they showed what we could be in the second half. I’m proud of their effort.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third period, after Platt faltered on its opening drive, Eastern quarterback Kamden Laprise (8-of-17, 100 yards) sent a short screen pass to Rayshon Andrews (six catches, 48 yards).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Andrews was off to the races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He charged through every Platt defender down the Eastern sideline on his way to a 46 yard touchdown reception and off a two-point conversion from Jaiden Forte (23 carries, 104 yards, two TDs), the game was afoot at 22-8 with 9:29 left in the third quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A botched Platt punt on the ensuing drive gave Eastern the ball on the Platt 27, leading to a short field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four plays later, Forte ran the ball nearly up the middle for a 13-yard touchdown plunge and with 6:53 remaining in the third, it was an eight-point game at 22-14.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jaiden did a great job today,” said Julius of Forte. “I believe it was the second touchdown we scored, he looked at us and said ‘I’m going to run this in. I want the ball’ and he did. We got behind some of our big guys and they did a nice job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Platt’s a really quality football team so for us to be able to move the ball on the ground with success is definitely a bright spot for us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the dagger came off the Eastern kickoff as Platt went six plays, churning out 87 yards which was capped by a tremendous 27 yard catch by Deante Torres and with 3:55 to go in the third, the Panthers surged in front 29-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern failed to score on the following drive, a Platt fumble was picked up by the Lancers’ Josh Aubin, but an injury to Laprise on the first play of the ensuing drive pressed back-up Alex Corvo into duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corvo might have been a little nervous but never showed it as he made all three of his passes for 16 total yards and helped set up the final scoring drive of the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As the back-up quarterback, you always have to be ready,” said Julius. “And Alex practices really hard. He’s a really smart kid and he pays attention. For us to be able to put the back up in there and really not have to close the playbook too much was a credit to how hard he prepares without guaranteed playing time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m really happy for him [but] obviously, I’m hopefully Kam is all right.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fore eventually punched in a two-yard TD run with 10:42 to play and after he ran in the two-point conversion, the deficit was trimmed to seven once again (29-22).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern stopped Platt on the ensuing drive, the Panthers then returned the favor, and with 5:09 to go, the home team eventually ran out the clock via a little stall-ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers took timeouts to slow the clock with less than 1:30 to play, but Platt took three knees and a late run and fall ended the contest with the home team grabbing a big 29-22 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s certainly something we’re going to have to figure out as a coaching staff,” said Julius of the team’s lack of consistency. “In the first half we just felt like it was execution. We were a block away here, we were a play away here. In the second half we clicked really well. We put it all together [and] we were able to do some really good stuff.”</p>
