<p>BRISTOL - How a scholastic sports team responds from adversity can show the true character of a program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after Bristol Central belted Bristol Eastern by a 73-24 final last Tuesday, there was a question that needed an immediate answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How would the Lancers fare in the consolation round of the Bristol Central’s Holiday Tournament a couple days later against Wolcott?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The response was a big resounding victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters ended up stomping the Eagles by twenty-two points, snaring a 58-36 triumph to notch their first victory of the season and after an 0-3 start, that win was a big deal for the young program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think that shows a lot,” said Eastern coach Bunty Ray of the victory. “Some teams, you lose big like that, then all of a sudden [they sulk. But beating Wolcott] says a lot about their character more than anything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down two starters, Eastern got a career-game out of point guard Nasir Walker-Jenkins as he dropped in 27 points in only 23 minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made 9-of-15 field goals, hit the free throw line early and often (9-for-11 overall) and helped engineer a slick little run to end the first half, pushing Eastern to a 31-22 halftime edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walker-Jenkins then blasted in 13 third period points to help salt the game away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lukas Sward (nine points, seven rebounds, four assists) also contributed while Elijah Borgelin just missed a double-double (nine points, nine rebounds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those three stepped up to help the Lancers seize a big non-conference victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any time you win a basketball game you can just kind of breathe a little bit easier,” said Ray. “Nobody wants to see a goose-egg on the winning side.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With those two starters out, Nate Fries and Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum (six points, three rebounds) have played extended minutes in starting roles which gives Eastern’s bench a little more depth and some badly needed experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naseem Walker-Jenkins helped Eastern stay ahead around the first and second period break, scooping in five straight points that turned a two-point edge into a three-possession game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His two assists and two steals were another excellent contribution while Ben D’Amato and Preston Guarda each logged double-figure minutes of court time for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s just going to make us even better,” said Ray of the bench production for Eastern. “It will just give us more options. Depth is an issue. Wearing a mask out there and you’re trying to breathe and play hard and press, you need more guys. This is going to allow me to develop more guys to also be complementary players.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These minutes are valuable for everybody.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once sophomore Brayden Dauphinais (7.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.0 steals-per-game) and senior Jeremiah Tatum (2.5 steals-per-game) re-enter the line-up, Eastern is going to be in much better shape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers are back at it tonight in a CCC South showdown against Berlin (2-1), starting at 6:45 p.m. from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Thursday, Simsbury (3-0) hasn’t played a game since defeating Avon on December 23 but will be the opponent of the day for the Lancers – also in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after that win over Wolcott, a little home cooking is never a bad thing for a young squad, eager to get back to the pay window in the worst way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now, we have a win under our belt, they saw what it felt like,” said Ray. “The energy in the locker room was one of happiness so we just have to replicate it.”</p>
