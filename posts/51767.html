<p>&nbsp;After being beaten.4-0, by Maloney in their second game of the year, the Lancers did better against the Spartans.&nbsp; &nbsp;However,&nbsp; Cristiano Cardentey was able to knife through the Lancers' defense and score at 30:33 of the first period.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As in other games, Eastern had some good looks at the goal but their shots went high or wide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“We played much better this time around, communicating well throughout the game, but Maloney's two best players were able to get by us," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "Our players worked hard the whole game against Maloney's nine seniors."</p>

<p>&nbsp;Maloney doubled the score when Youseff Machmech took a pass and beat his defender to knock home the game winner at 15:19.&nbsp; &nbsp;Minutes later, the Lancers just missed on a corner kick, but at 1:28 cut the lead in half.&nbsp; Hunter Scott took a shot that a Maloney defender knocked down with his hand.&nbsp; That resulted in a successful penalty kick executed by Matt Cabrera.</p>
