<p>Well, you have to give the new City of Bristol administration credit.&nbsp;I thought for sure it would be at least six months before they thoroughly derailed economic development in the city.&nbsp;Nope! They exceeded all expectations and caused a total train wreck in only 45 days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Nothing confirms this better than the disaster that took place at the last City Council meeting regarding the Wheeler Clinic opportunity.&nbsp;Our newly elected mayor and what appears now to be a totally out of control band of “councilors” proved in short order that they are neither qualified for the roles they were elected to, nor even capable of understanding the basics of economic development.</p>

<p>For heaven's sake they didn’t just miss a layup here, they bounced the ball into the stands and ripped down the backboard. It boggles the mind -- and should send shivers up the spine of every business and tax paying homeowner in this city -- to think about the extent of damage this bunch can do over the next 22 and a half months. </p>

<p>I reached out to my two councilors from District 2, Sue Tyler and Jacqueline Olsen.&nbsp;After an initial email exchange, Councilor Tyler and I had an open and candid phone call.&nbsp;She made sure that I knew that “entertainment” wasn’t her concern as she recognizes that entertainment will be enhanced by the refurbished Memorial Boulevard Arts Center and magnet school.&nbsp;That’s commendable.&nbsp;However, her belief that somehow retail will suddenly populate the downtown area without support from other employers defies logic and flies in the face of the data provided to the council.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Councilor Olsen (via email) was on the “entertainment” side of the equation. To be fair, Councilor Olsen and I have played text/telephone tag for days without spending but a few minutes chatting.&nbsp;That said, the email she sent was quite telling.&nbsp;Similar to Councilor Tyler, Councilor Olsen also believes (in addition to entertainment) that retail will also pop up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Councilors Tyler and Olsen kept referring to anecdotal claims that their votes reflect the will of their constituents.&nbsp; They insisted that their “polling” (translated: asking leading questions of a select few to get the answer you want to hear) was far better than the reams of data, plans and professionally developed presentation from a successful Economic Development Director and a highly qualified and bi-partisan Economic Development Commission.&nbsp;Data that shows that retail and restaurants (entertainment if you will) follows economic growth.&nbsp;It doesn’t lead it.</p>

<p>Even if we can chalk this up to “rookie mistakes,” more concerning was the total lack of respect and (even more amazing) total lack of knowledge of Tom Barnes and his role in this community. Tom is a professional with thick skin, he’ll be fine. But the fact that the District 2 councilors had no idea who he was and totally devalued what he had to say, tells me that they have no clue of the critical role that the Barnes Group plays in this community. The Barnes name is well-respected in this city from both an economic base and philanthropic contribution standpoint. Councilors, it was your duty to find that out.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to the rest of the council, but in watching the video there is no question that three of the remaining four are just as lost.&nbsp;I will give Councilor Panioto credit for wanting to do the right thing and for his hope to come up with a solution.&nbsp;Another location perhaps? Two more years wasted as the opportunity dries up and blows away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The damage is done. Regardless of how this turns out, undoing the damage to Bristol’s reputation in the economic development community will take an effort for which this administration is not close to being qualified to reverse. I was at a holiday party after the vote and an old friend involved with economic development in West Hartford sought me out to say, “Wow, for the last four years Bristol was a formidable competitor. Looks like that’s over. Thanks!” Word travels fast.</p>

<p>We have a very serious problem here folks. Without prompt action it will only get worse. Other than his daily photo ops the new mayor’s first two administrative actions were to lob a grenade at labor (good luck with collective bargaining) and then have his “handpicked” council embarrass him and the city by torpedoing a fantastic opportunity for the downtown area.</p>

<p>We’ll see what January brings.&nbsp;For now, the train is off the rails and lying on its side.&nbsp;The scary part is that the five city councilors who engineered this debacle are all standing there looking at their handy work with the attitude of “Looks good to me.”</p>
