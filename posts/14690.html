<h2>Registrars have received criticism for changes in districts, but changes were decided at the State level</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>The Bristol Registrars of Voters are in the process of mailing out notices to all Bristol voters of possible changes to their polling place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These changes are mandated every ten years by state law, using the census data from the recent nationwide census. So the state Reapportionment Commission has changed some of Bristol’s assembly district boundaries. The federal government requires districts to be nearly equal in population and must not discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity.</p>

<p>Republican Registrar Sharon Krawiecki has been concerned by criticism of the new districts that some have claimed was done to favor Republicans in town. ”These district changes were done at the state level,” said Krawiecki. ”Our job as Registrars is to follow the new lines and adjust our local council districts so that they comply with the redrawn lines. The decision was not ours, but done by the state commision.”</p>

<p>Democrat Registrar Kevin McCauley agrees with Krawiecki,  saying ”We were actually comfortable with what we had from ten years ago. We didn’t feel there was much change, plus or minus, with population for the demographics. But the state looks at population and not at voters. When they redistrict they look at the amount of potential voters in any given district, and that’s where they determine shifting of district lines.”</p>

<p>That being said, McCauley does think there were some significant changes this year, especially with the 77th district line being shifted to take up much of Chippens Hill all the way to the Terryville border. ”But again, that was decided on the state level, and then the full legislature votes yea or nay, and they voted it in, so that’s both sides of the aisle,” said McCauley.</p>

<p>Every resident receiving a letter will also get a magnet reminding them of their polling place. All letters are planned to be out by July 18.</p>
