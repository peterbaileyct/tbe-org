<p>There is a connection with National Navajo Code Talker Day, celebrated on Aug. 14, and local World War II veteran and Iwo Jima survivor Joe Caminiti.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The morning of Feb. 19, 1945, Marines began to land on the Island of Iwo Jima. Caminiti, a member of an amphibious trac squad, was tasked with landing Marines on the beach. Directly behind his wave was the Higgins landing boat carrying Navajo Code Talker Thomas Begay.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Begay was part of the first wave of Higgins boats to land troops. Begay, who after the war ended, helped found "Navajo Code Talker Day," which became official, having been established in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Caminiti and Begay both were on the island for the complete time of the conflict. Both operated out of the same airfield. Both pulled guard duty at night protecting the airfield. Caminiti's job was to go forward during the daylight with his trac to recover the dead, bring supplies and return the wounded to either an aid station or directly to the medical ships. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of the orders Caminiti received were relayed from the front areas through Begay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, they never met during their time on the island.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2022, the World War II Legacy Foundation held the "End of the War" program in East Hartford. Arrangements were made for Begay and Caminiti to meet. Begay was to be the guest speaker. Due to all the events Thomas attended earlier, he was too weak to travel to Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the day of the event, Begay called into the hotel where the program was being held to hook into its public address system. Begay sang the Marine Corps hymn in his native tongue to Caminiti and a fellow Iwo Jima survivor, Mr. Richards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During this time, artist Don Scott had begun his initiative to paint World War II survivors, among the first he painted were Caminiti and Begay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Feb 19, Scott finished Begay's portrait. On March 10, Scott unveiled the painting at the Bristol Public Library, where Caminiti had the honor of being the first to see the painting. Shortly afterwards the painting was presented to Begay in person by the Scott along with a special birthday card signed by those who attended the World War II/ Iwo Jima Veterans Reunion at the library.  </p>

<p>Begay and Caminiti missed another opportunity to meet in 2020 in Washington, D.C., as part of an anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima program, when of them were unable to attend.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
