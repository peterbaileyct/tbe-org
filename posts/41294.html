<p>Members of three Bristol nonprofits gathered to celebrate the grand opening of the Appetite for Reading Little Free Library at&nbsp;St. Vincent DePaul on Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re so excited to open our second Little Free Library in the Bristol Community,” Donna Koser said. “When I first reached out to DK Movement Cares, they were so enthusiastic about the project. We received a generous donation from them to place the Little Free Library here at St. Vincent DePaul.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A collaborative effort between Making Bristol Better, DK Movement Cares Inc and St. Vincent DePaul Mission of Bristol, the Little Free Library was created to nurture the love of reading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Koser, the Bristol Early Childhood Alliance Coordinator, was joined by Making Bristol Better volunteers who encourage the love of reading in young children and families. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of their Appetite for Reading initiative, the nonprofit has opened bookshelves around the city, including a Little Free Library outside of the WIC office. Koser reached out to members of DK Movement Cares last year, who funded the project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m from Bristol, and I lived in three different shelters growing up,” Derek Jones said. “Giving back to those who really need it here in my community, it’s so important.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jones co-founded DK Movement Cares with Kelly Houston last year. The mission of the Bristol nonprofit is to provide compassionate care and support to individuals, children, families, and those with special needs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of our goals as a nonprofit is to help other nonprofits and individuals in the community,” said Houston. “We want to provide support to those who need it.”</p>

<p>In addition to a diverse collection of books, the Little Free Library will also offer warm hats and gloves during the colder months. Christine Thebarge, Executive Director of St. Vincent DePaul Mission of Bristol, stated that the newest addition to the shelter will help to promote reading and self-sufficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The people who come here won’t have to ask for anything. They won’t have to go downstairs and ask for a book or a pair of gloves; if they need it, they can take it,” Thebarge said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Any people who come to see us that need a shower, or need to get warmed up, or need to see a case manager, they can grab a book here,” Thebarge continued. “Maybe it’s something they read when they were a kid, or it’s a story that might be a little more make-believe so they can disappear into the book for a while and get out of their own head.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new community bookshelf was installed earlier this year by Jones and United Way of Central Connecticut President Manny Martinez. With the Little Free Library now open, volunteers from Making Bristol Better will keep the shelves well stocked.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re so grateful to DK Movement, to Derek and Kelly, for this beautiful library and for the community partnership,” said Making Bristol Better Parent Ambassador Jennifer St. John. “The free library is a great asset to the community.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
