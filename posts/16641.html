<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the excitement continues to build this month as the return of scholastic football is&nbsp;less than a week away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday in TBE, we looked at Bristol’s all-time leading rusher – Tim Washington – and observed his All-State accomplishments and records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Washington had a brilliant career for Bristol Central but the second leading rusher in town also did pretty well for his respective program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this tremendous athlete still holds several records at his school in terms of rushing, defense, and the like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, which player is Bristol’s second leading all-time rusher?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a special look at former Eastern standout Reinaldo Soto – the Mum City’s second leading scholastic rusher:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Reinaldo Soto, Bristol Eastern, 5,161 rushing yards (1995-1998)<br></strong>*Collected a then school record 1,713 yards in 1996&nbsp;as a sophomore and added to those totals with nearly 1,600 yards in both his junior and senior campaigns. He raced for 1,582 yards in 1997&nbsp;and added another 1,586 in 1998 as a senior standout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The lowdown:&nbsp;</strong>Before Washington  was running wild at Central, there was Reinaldo Soto busting tackles over at Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto was tremendous over his final three seasons for the Lancers, breaking numerous school scoring records and leaving defenders in the dust at tailback.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Washington, he even threw the ball from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto started showing his mettle as a freshman and simply took off as a sophomore under then head coach Chris Cassin – leading the Lancers to a tremendous 9-2 ledger in 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto was offensive to the extreme against Hall back on October 3, 1998, when the senior put on a show as the Lancers dropped the Warriors by a 27-0 final in West Hartford.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tallied touchdown scores of 73, 74, and 47 yards while rushing for 260 yards on just 17 carries.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto notched 74 career touchdowns at Eastern and zipped up 33 TDs for the then Connecticut state record as a sensational sophomore.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a senior, Soto nabbed 20 touchdowns as the 6-foot, 185 pound speedster had the third most career TDs to that point in Connecticut scholastic history.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was a slick 22-10 over Soto’s final three seasons for the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also tallied All-Conference and All-State honors (three times) over multiple seasons which included tremendous defensive efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1996, Soto made six fumble recoveries which is currently tied for the 15<sup>th</sup> most in a season in Connecticut history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alone on November 16, 1996 – in a 41-6 blitzing at Bulkeley – Soto scooped in three fumbles for half his season total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s the offense that he’s most known for and when Soto was barreling past the line of scrimmage at back, he simply could not be stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanksgiving was a fun time for Soto and that excellent offensive line between 1996-1998.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto won the Thomas R. Monahan Offensive Player of the Game Award in both 1996 and 1998, rushing for 100-plus yards over three wins by the Lancers over the Rams during that stretch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1996, Soto raced for 183 yards on 32 carries as Eastern won 29-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in 1997, the back zipped up 114 yards on 20 carries in a 33-7 Eastern thrashing over Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in 1998, Soto tallied 137 yards (20 carries) as the Lancers got to the pay window over the Rams, 35-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And by the completion of his career at Eastern, Soto was Bristol’s all-time leading rusher with 5,161 yards – surpassing Garry Pearson’s 5,084 he compiled at both BC and BE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soto had collegiate suitors in the form of UMASS, Northeastern, and Central Connecticut State University and picked from that lot.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He attended CCSU but his football talents were never fully utilized as Soto eventually left the program – never to play collegiately again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in terms of athletes from Bristol, he doesn’t rank that much off the abilities of Washington, the current all-time leading rusher in town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s the common thread between Soto and Washington (well, besides football)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo were competent basketball players who used their blazing speed to slash to the hoop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This November, Soto takes his place in the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2022.  </p>
