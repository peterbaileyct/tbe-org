<p>Wheeler Health is the only community health center in Connecticut to receive designation as an "LLGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader,” it was announced yesterday in a release from Wheeler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The designation comes from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HRC), which with its <a href="http://reports.hrc.org/hei-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthcare Equality Index (HEI)</a>, released yesterday, includes Wheeler Health in about 384 institutions that received the top score of 100.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A record 1,065 healthcare facilities actively participated in the HEI 2024 survey and scoring process, according to the announcement by Wheeler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This level of recognition aligns with our core values and reflects our steadfast commitment to leading the way in serving the LGBTQ+ community,” said Sabrina Trocchi, president and chief executive officer of Wheeler Health, in the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“More than anything, providing high-quality, accessible care to the LGBTQ+ community is more than just an aspiration. It’s a ‘non-negotiable,’” added Trocchi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To achieve this tier of recognition, a healthcare facility must demonstrate true leadership in adopting LGBTQ+ policies and practices and receive full credit in the four areas below. Organizations must also meet the criteria for the provision of transgender-inclusive health insurance.</p>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Patient and Community Engagement.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Key highlights from the report include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>36 percent of 1,065 total participants earned the designation “2024 LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Targeted Health Disparities Reduction Plans: Encouragingly, 71 percent have an official plan for reducing health disparities that specifically includes LGBTQ+ patients in addition to race, ethnicity, and linguistic concerns.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Work to Be Done: Only 27 percent have an externally promoted specific program to provide patient navigation or advocacy services to transgender patients.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Bias Elimination and Welcoming Interactions: Just over half (53 percent) have a policy or policies that specifically outline procedures and practices aimed at eliminating bias and insensitivity, and ensuring appropriate, welcoming interactions with transgender patients.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>EHR SOGI Data: Major increases are seen in the number of healthcare facilities collecting sexual orientation and gender identity-related data in their Electronic Health Records systems. Seven of the eight relevant data points had double-digit increases.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Pronouns in Electronic Health Records: The ability to collect and display a patient’s pronouns rose from 44 percent to 74 percent. This is an important tool to help prevent misgendering a patient.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>FMLA-Equivalent Benefits: 38 percent offer FMLA-equivalent benefits that allow employees to take family and medical leave to care for same-sex partners as well as the children of a same-sex partner, regardless of biological or adoptive status – this is up from 34% in 2022.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Comprehensive Benefits for Domestic Partners: 41 percent provide medical and comprehensive health benefits to domestic partners of benefits-eligible employees up from 34 percent in 2022. This is the first increase in this measure since the 2015 Obergefell decision on same-sex marriage.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Employee Resource Groups: 72 percent have an officially recognized LGBTQ+ employee resource group.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Community Engagement and Support: 92 percent took part in or supported one or more LGBTQ+ related events or initiatives in their service area.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler delivers innovative and equitable care in several ways, according to the release. Services such as Walk With Me, which continue to expand with the support of an anonymous donor and local community foundations, offer a specialized outpatient treatment track for LGBTQ+-identifying people of all ages. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The organization also offers gender-affirming hormone therapy for adults, prophylaxis treatment, as well as an environment of care guided by an LGBTQ+ Patient Advisory Board, including inclusive restrooms and highly trained staff who provide patient-centered care based on individual needs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wheeler’s Foster Care team works closely with community members interested in foster care and related LGBTQ+ issues, and the organization supports various LGBTQ+ events throughout the year, tracking data to identify gaps and identify solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, staff are supported through training and ongoing development for their work with the LGBTQ+ community as well as their own personal growth. Employee engagement is fostered through LGBTQ+ speakers, diversity committees, and through promotion of a culture of respect by living Wheeler’s values of Compassion, Diversity and Inclusion, Integrity and Teamwork.</p>

<p>This year’s HEI comes as <a href="https://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Survey-on-Racism-Discrimination-and-Health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LGBTQ+ adults are twice as likely</a> as non-LGBTQ+ adults to be “treated unfairly or with disrespect by a doctor or healthcare provider” in the last three years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which the release quotes from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The impact of <a href="https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Anti-LGBTQ-Legislation-Impact-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-LGBTQ+ legislation</a> combined with a history of discrimination in healthcare settings has the potential to cause even more LGBTQ+ people to delay or avoid seeking healthcare, which makes the HEI even more salient for those looking to find LGBTQ+-inclusive care.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
