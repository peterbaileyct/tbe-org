<p>Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregation (GSJC) in Southington is beginning preparations for its 40th anniversary event to be held in 2024. The first step is compiling a thorough, written history by contacting everyone who contributed in any way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GSJC began in 1983 as the Southington Jewish Community Group and was incorporated as Greater Southington Jewish Congregation in 1984. Over the years, it has changed its name and location, finding a permanent home at the First Congregational Church where its name, which means “Bridges to Peace”, can be found on the sign on Main Street.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Laura Minor, volunteer on the history committee said, “We are looking for people who have been members or visitors of GSJC in the past and who may have photos, newspaper articles or personal stories that should be included in our records. We want to document the full forty-year history by including all who have been part of our religious rituals and traditions, educational programs, social action efforts, interfaith activities and other initiatives in which we interacted with community members and institutions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The congregation has overcome challenges and experienced growth during its four decades. Early services were lay-led and then performed by once-a-month rabbinical students. Now, they contract with a part-time ordained rabbi, Rabbi Alana Wasserman, who began her tenure with the congregation in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small congregation initially met in members’ homes, Briarwood College and other churches before establishing its non-traditional, long-term connection with the First Congregational Church in 1992. The congregation runs its own Shabbat school for youth from kindergarten through bar/bat mitzvah ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the tiny group’s most significant accomplishments is becoming the shomrim (guardians) of a saved Holocaust Torah written in the 1600’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the COVID pandemic, the congregation moved quickly to a Zoom model for Friday night, Saturday morning and High Holiday services as well as for traditional communal celebrations such Chanukah and Passover. Volunteers dropped off packages with prayer books, grape juice, candles, etc. at members’ and guests' homes to allow all to observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Rabbi Alana Wasserman&nbsp; “Zooms” on her tablet and also has been offering blended services when the building has permitted live attendance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In preparation for the anniversary, all previous presidents and rabbis have been contacted, old newsletters are being collected with photos and articles uploaded to the congregation’s Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gsjc777">https://www.facebook.com/gsjc777</a>) and website (<a href="http://www.gsjc.org/">www.gsjc.org</a>). From all of these sources, four decades of accomplishments, worship and celebrations will have a permanent record created for posterity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marc Romanow, the congregation’s current president, urged all who have been part of the congregation in any way to assist. “We invite all who have been associated with GSJC’s history to participate in this effort. We represent a small but mighty community that embraces worship, social justice programs, education and more for almost four decades. It’s truly an amazing&nbsp; celebration.”</p>

<p>As the congregation gears up for this commemoration, they are offering a special “15 month membership” program for new or returning members at the usual cost of an annual membership. Those who are interested in learning more about the congregation and/or participating in this project can contact Laura Minor at 860.978.1210,&nbsp; Marc Romanow at 860.276.9113 or president@gsjc.org or membership@gsjc.org.</p>
