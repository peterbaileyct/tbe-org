<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am writing on behalf of the Bristol Town Committee and the many residents that have reached out recently with their concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the recent exposure of Jim Albert's extreme racism expressed publicly on his Facebook page and an uptick in other instances of racism and white supremacy in Bristol, the Bristol Democratic Town Committee is requesting the following of the Mayor's Office and the City Council:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Take a proactive stance and remove Jim Albert from any involvement with the Bristol Farmer's Market and any Bristol boards, commissions or other affiliations with the City. As you know, the Farmer's Market is a partnership between the Rotary Club and the City, and as such, it is your responsibility to protect the residents of Bristol from the hatred and vitriol distributed by Mr. Albert.  You Do have the power to remove him from his position.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Send a report of the events in Bristol to the Connecticut State Police Hate Crimes Division so that it is documented and monitored.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Introduce a motion at the Sept. 12, City Council meeting denouncing this type of activity in the City.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Actively recruit residents to serve on the Diversity Committee and provide the necessary administrative and financial support so that this committee can engage and do work on these issues.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
