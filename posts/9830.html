<p>The City of Bristol announced Monday that the City will direct a portion of up to $24 million of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding to assist Bristol businesses and nonprofit organizations with eligible costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A portion of the initial $24 million ARPA allocation will also be made available for eligible City projects, including infrastructure upgrades and more.</p>

<p>The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is the sixth federal COVID-19 relief bill passed in the last year and is <br>by far the largest infusion of resources to the State of Connecticut. It is estimated that more than $6 billion <br>will come to the state of Connecticut through multiple ARPA grant programs. <br></p>

<p>The City of Bristol will receive approximately $28 million in ARPA dollars over the next five years. A 15-member ARPA Task Force, comprised of appointed members from the community, has been formed to help determine how these funds will be distributed to benefit the Bristol community. The task force has selected UHY Advisors as the consultant to assist with the eligibility review, reporting, and project monitoring process.</p>
