<p>The 2022 CIAC Open Golf Championships took place this past Saturday and Bristol Central’s Scott Petrosky had a very good day on the green.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finished in the top-12 at the event, carding a seven over par for a score of 78 from the Black Hall Golf Club in Old Lyme.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, he nabbed 11th place in a very competitive and crowded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guilford’s Andrew Beauton won the Open with a total score of 70 - one under par.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he had Ellington’s Bradley Sawka on his heels, just one stroke behind, while East Windsor’s Ryan Willey and St. Paul Catholic’s Matthew Downes each shot two over (73).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After his first five holes, the junior from Central was shooting three over par but Petrosky nabbed a birdie on hole six to stay in contention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was just three over after the completion of the front nine and shot four over to complete the back nine.</p>
