<p>He graduated from Porter School of Design and worked for Marlin Rockwell and General Time, then as a top sales representative for Producto Machine Co. until his retirement in 1997. He enjoyed visiting the machine shops, large and small, throughout New England; sometimes selling, but mostly to satisfy his curiosity in how things were made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bob’s interests included tinkering and working with his hands. He made many fine family heirlooms including furniture, hand carved boxes and clocks, leaded glass windows and so many cherished gifts. He never shied away from taking on a large project. </p>

<p>He was proud to have designed and built the family home on Vantana Drive at the age of 30. With his sons, he restored a 1959 MGA and a 1969 Camaro, both to meticulous perfection. Bob enjoyed travel with his wife and family throughout Europe and the Caribbean. Even touring the East Coast on his Gold Wing. </p>

<p>He was an amazing husband and father, and he often expressed his love and appreciation for his family. He especially loved and was proud of his grandchildren who mutually admired and respected him and all his talents. He was faithful and a longtime devoted parishioner of St. Gregory the Great Church, Bristol where he served as an usher.</p>

This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
