<p>In the last week’s TBE, we covered the additions and renovations to the Bristol parks throughout the city. Today we will talk about the changes and additions that will be happening at Page Park. These changes are scheduled to occur in four stages over the next four years. The total project is budgeted to cost $13.5 million.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One major renovation has already taken place at Page Park, as the pool was rebuilt with major changes in 2021. The updated pool features a zero-depth entry ramp and new water spray features, an updated mechanical system, and new lights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locker rooms were also redone. A waterscape greets visitors at the pool’s front desk and locker rooms can be accessed from either side. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>But the reborn pool was only the beginning. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting this summer or early fall, the first of four stages of renovation will take place in the park. Stage one is pictured below. In the area where the tennis courts are presently located, the plan calls for an addition of four pickle ball courts to be built on the end (#4)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pavilion is being constructed (#3) adjacent to the courts. And finally a new area of parking (#5) is situated above the courts.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stage Two of the renovations is scheduled for some time in 2024. As pictured below, the Stage Two plan calls for a parking lot to be constructed at the entrance of the Page Park disc golf course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disc golf has proven to be a great feature, and because of its popularity, a parking area is really needed. There is a dirt and gravel area there now, but that will be replaced by a paved parking lot (#14).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The centerpiece of the Page Park rebuild is planned for Stage Three. As pictured below, the area adjacent to the pond will be transformed into a hub of activity, with a playground, a splash pad, and a Great Lawn that will have multiple uses such as concerts, movies, exercise classes, parties, etc. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There will be a new road constructed that will lead up to the Perry Spinelli Pavilion, and a parking area with 60 spaces will be built there with a turnaround circle right next to the pavilion.</p>

<p>Stage Four will be the final phase of the Page Park Renovation. After a new playground is established up near the pond in Stage Three, the current playground alongside King Street will be razed and Phase Four will begin. Two new basketball courts (#2) will be built in that lower area with a parking lot (#1) where the playground used to be.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be noted that some aspects of the original design for Page Park had to be eliminated because of cost concerns. The original design called for the softball field to be relocated to the upper part of Page Park and a baseball field would remain below with artificial turf and lights. That pushed the price of the project well over the budgeted amount allowed and had to be cut. So the baseball and softball fields will remain in their original places, at least for now.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
