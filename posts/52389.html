<p>The Bristol Fire Department is set to host its inaugural Fightin’ For A Cure Fundraiser this Friday to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer screening and treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For over a decade, members of the IAFF Local 773 Bristol Firefighters have sold pink T-shirts at the Bristol Farmers Market each October in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month. This year, Bristol Firefighter Seth Zepka sought to expand the department's fundraising efforts beyond T-shirt sales.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We wanted to do something different this year, something that would bring the community together,” Zepka said. "We thought a collaboration with The New Cambridge Project would be great.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zepka, who has spearheaded the department's breast cancer fundraising initiatives for the past four years, partnered with the brewery to create a special release beer specifically for the fundraiser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a blast working with the firefighters to brew beer for a cause,” said Spencer Shankle, co-owner of The New Cambridge Project. “We all talked about what kind of beer they wanted and decided on something effervescent and fruity; something anyone can enjoy. We’d love to raise $2,500 for the cause.”</p>

<p>For $20 at the door, guests will receive a Bristol Fire Department coozie and a pour of the special brew. Additionally, pink and navy short-sleeve T-shirts featuring the new design for 2024 will be available for purchase for $30. All proceeds from the event will benefit the Beekley Center for Breast Health &amp; Wellness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s so important being able to make that donation to the Beekley Center,” Zepka said, “They provide mammograms and screenings to people who can’t afford them. I hope this event becomes something that we do every year, that it takes off. It’s always good to bring the community together.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family-friendly event will feature non-alcoholic beverages for those who prefer them. Lucan’s Grill Food Truck will also be on site, offering a variety of Jamaican culinary delights, including burgers, chicken wings, and jerk pork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Fightin’ For A Cure Fundraiser will be held at The New Cambridge Project on Friday Oct. 18, from 6 to 10 p.m.</p>
