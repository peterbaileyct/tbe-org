<p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas Eve from your friends at The Bristol Edition. From left standing, Jack Krampitz and Anna Bedell, from left seated, Rit Carter, Laura Bailey, David Fortier and Evan Ruszczyk. Absent: Mike Letendre. The gang gathered for a late breakfast at Expresso Cafe on Maple Street last weekend as part of our own holiday celebration.</p>

<p>We wish everyone happy days, fond memories of the past year and hope for a joyful new year, during celebrations from every religious tradition, which this time of year are many. Chanukah is nearing its end, which is Dec. 26. The same day Kwanza begins. Members of the Orthodox tradition are looking forward to January for their own celebration.  </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
