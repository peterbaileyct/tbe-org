<p>A crowd of around 100 gathered under umbrellas outside the pavilion on Veterans Memorial Boulevard and Park on Memorial Day for a ceremony that included short speeches and the reading of the names of those veterans who died in American wars and conflicts since Vietnam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A procession from Hope Street to the pavilion was canceled because of the rain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the ceremony at the paviliion, the crowd crossed over the boulevard for the dedication of the new POW/MIA monument, where the MIA Table Ceremony was conducted, and the commander of Post 209 delivered a short address.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Despite Memorial Day being noted as the first day of summer, along with picnics, it's always been a solemn occasion of remembrance for me and all of you," said Vietnam veteran John Lodovico speaking at the pavilion directly to an audience with many veterans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lodovico, a Bristol native and lifelong resident, remembered three individuals who died in battle, each from a separate American war or conflict.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first was Vito Coppi from World War II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In the mid-40s, you would go to the movie house," Lodovico said, speaking about Coppi, his mother's first cousin, "and they would have clips of the fighting going on in Europe. His mother and father were at this one movie and there's a clip of Vito."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"They were so happy to see him in this clip, that that is all they could talk about," Lodovico said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three weeks later they were notified that he had been wounded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"They got a notice that he was in a field hospital, and all was well," Lodovico said. "Well, all wasn't well. A few weeks later they received a notice that he passed away from his wounds."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"My mom told me this," Lodovico said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second was Michael Louis Caputo, who died on Oct. 7, 1952, in North Korea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He was killed while fighting enemy in hand-to-hand combat," Lodovico said. "His remains were never recovered."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last was Phil Nestico, who attended Bristol Central High School, as did Lodovico. Nestico died from artillery rocket mortar fire, at 18 years old in Vietnam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He had an infectious smile, was not that big of a kid. He was a great student at Bristol Central High School, an unbelievable wrestler at Bristol Central High School," Lodovico said. "Unfortunately, he never made it out."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"There are many, many more I could talk about," Lodovico said, adding that there were 17 or 18 other names that came to mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Today is a day of remembrance," Lodovico said. "It's not a happy moment. It's a day to honor the dead."</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brian Avery, the vice chair of the Bristol Veterans Council, commander of Post 2 and chair of the fundraising committee for the POW/MIA monument, picked up on the importance of remembering those who have served, especially those who never made it home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Those who remain missing in action left behind families and comrades who have carried the weight of their absences every single day," Avery said. "There bravery and sacrifice are the bedrock of our freedom."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It is because of them we are able to gather here today, live in a country that values liberty and justice," he said. "The monument serves as a permanent reminder for our community and our commitment to never forget the sacrifices made by the POWs and MIAs."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The monument, he said, provides a place of reflection to honor their bravery and the profound cost of these freedoms."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Let this monument be more than a symbol," he said. "Let it be a call to action. We must continue to seek answers for the families of those still missing and support them in their endeavor as they wait."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said, as a nation, we must ensure that their sacrifices have not been in vain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Included in this is upholding a commitment to these veterans and their families and make sure they receive the support and recognition they deserve.</p>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The white tablecloth--pure intentions of those who respond to the country's call.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>A red rose in a vase -- the bloodshed in their sacrifice and the loved ones and friends who keep the faith, awaiting their return.</li>

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->

<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
