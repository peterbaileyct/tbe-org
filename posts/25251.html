<p>MERIDEN – Competing against the Bristol Central girls softball program is like getting a chance to compete on the ‘Price Is Right’ game show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might be easy to get into ‘contestant’s row’ but trying to win those ridiculous games - and fabulous and exciting prizes - ends up being&nbsp;impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s how most opponents have felt in battling the Rams over the past season-in-a-half or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you get to the plate, trying to get a hit off one of two NCAA Division I pitchers in the form of Pia Torreso and Alex Sciarretto isn’t fun nor easy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then spinning a ball past an infield (or outfield) that doesn’t make many miscues isn’t a promising situation to be in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s when the game show, or the CCC South bout against Central, isn’t fun anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the most recent Wednesday to Friday stretch, with those two pitching studs showing no mercy from the circle, the duo chucked three shoutouts while striking out multiple batters&nbsp;at the dish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was the defensive component that spurred this undefeated program on behind those pitchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s what you get from Central, a veteran crew staffing positions one through nine and then attempting to navigate a hungry cast of substitutes that will chew and spit out all the scraps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to Central’s softball program, there isn’t any tomfoolery or gimmicks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those athletes display a serious brand of ball every youngster who wants to play the sport should emulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These kids are serious about playing softball,” said Central coach Monica Hayes. “And it’s great to coach kids who take it seriously. It’s a different level that I enjoy very thoroughly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undefeated teams like Central, currently at 8-0, have athletes that are checked in from start to finish with outstanding ability to match.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A reserve like Tori Hogan has shown promise at the plate and over at third base as the first-year scholastic student is going to be a good one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same can be said for Sierra Messier, Emma Kulak, Abby Simard, and Isabella Guarda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of those athletes can and will contribute to the winning ways of the Class L runners-up from 2022 when called upon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have lots of different lineups,” said Hayes. “We put different players in the games, combinations that we can put out there. Just because somebody isn’t starting a game, we’re not losing much when they go into games. So that’s how we look at it. I think they’re starting to understand that it’s a total team effort.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s what’s going to help us win some big games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Three games in a row means three wins for Central&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over that three pack of games from this past week, Central outscored the opposition 44-0 over a suffocating stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s Torreso and Sciarretto throwing changeups, rise balls and everything else but the kitchen sink that Enfield, Hall and Platt simply couldn’t get their bats on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget Lorelei Stancavage is the world class catcher behind the plate, helping to lead the charge as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That kid never gets the credit she rightfully deserves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has allowed just four runs all season long, good for a per-game average of 0.50 runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s championship level defense few teams in the state can emulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There wasn’t any letdown emotionally. We finished the week really strong,” said Hayes. “We knew that was our week coming in so we knew we would have to play three games in a row at some point because of that rain on Monday.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And I thought they prepared well for it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Big one [not too far] ahead</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington, who visits Central on Monday, May 8 (4:45 p.m.) in a must-see battle, has allowed only one run this season (10-1 victory over Windsor).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is an absolute state tournament preview and the game of the season for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central isn’t looking that far ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a game-by-game method, seeing the Rams improve daily as the season is a marathon, not a sprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central/Platt was a CCC interdivisional bout</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hope of the showdown between the Rams and Panthers was that Sciarretto would be battling Platt pitching stud Emily Hart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in a clever maneuver, the Panthers’ coaching staff held Hart out of the bout, saving her for later CCC South battles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hart is one of the South’s best pitchers outside of Torreso and Sciarretto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rematch between the Central and Platt squads is this Wednesday (3:45 p.m.) and expect the possible showdown between Sciarretto and Hart come to pass in Bristol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before then, the Rams will be traveling back to Meriden to square off against Maloney on Monday night (6 p.m.) from the Dunn Sports Complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if Torreso takes the circle, the home team is in for another long evening.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>100th win for Hayes&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s victory against Hall last Thursday, a 23-0 drubbing of the squad from West Hartford, was the 100th career win for Hayes as coach of the softball program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She took over the team, replacing Nicole Shook in 2015 and has coached over 160 games at Bristol Central.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Hayes is 101-60 as head coach and is an excellent mentor for the squad.&nbsp;<br></p>
