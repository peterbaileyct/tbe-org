<p>The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team went to BC Monday night and returned to King Street victorious with a decisive 18-7 thumping of Bristol Central.</p>

<p>The Lancers were paced by Harper Dauphinee's six goal explosion.  Emma Stavens and Vanessa Drury both had four goals while Savannah Drury, Jayna Hatcher, Kate Patterson and Natalia Vye each popped in one.</p>

<p>Leah Roy was feasting on ground balls in the middle of the field with six. And Jayna Hatcher's matchup D with the help of Meg Krok and Gabby McLay really set the tone for the game.&nbsp;</p>
