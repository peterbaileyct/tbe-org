<p><strong>By David Fortier</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come Sunday morning, the Fortier clan will have made a visit to the Peabody Museum in New Haven. There were the four grandkids, their parents, the youngest and partner and Mary and me. We started with pizza at Bar--ah, New Haven pizza and made our way over to Whitney Avenue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before that, however, there was a couple of months of waiting. The museum, which had been renovated over a four-year period, incorporating all that new knowledge about dinosaurs (and people, too) reopened in March, toting free admission for all. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, admission is by appointment only. The parents called for an appointment right away, but apparently not as quickly as others. The soonest one turned out to be Saturday at 2 p.m. Which worked out just fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having been around young kids over the past few years, I don't think this is a surprise to anyone who has, I have learned that there is nothing they cannot absorb--including the names of dinosaurs, plant life and sea life. Multi-syllabic dinosaur names roll off the tongue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The imposing figures loaming over us, of course, in the brightly painted exhibit rooms often with appropriate lighting to enhance appearances, received warm welcomes, as if greeting old friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, after an hour of over stimulation, it was time to wrap up and head separate ways. Wonderful. </p>

<p>Back to more notes on news and the democratic life. Having talked with friends and listened to where they get their news, I was encouraged to check out these sources. The sources? TV news. I just don't watch it much, regardless of a platform. What struck me is this--the presentation is overwhelming. It is an event. It is entertainment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But is it? Really, it's only the news. That may sound a bit dismissive, but it is not. News is not an event. It is part of our lives. Every day we need our news just as we need nutrition, and really, I am guessing not all our meals are events. We save those for special occasions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By making our daily news endlessly eventful, it diminishes its significance and numbs us to news in general. We need our news. We need news daily. But we need it as sustenance, not entertainment. Otherwise, news defeats its own purpose, which is to inform, to carve out time to absorb and mull over what we have been informed of and to decide what it means for ourselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's only the news. Just a thought.  </p>

<p>For listening, how about the episode, "Vico, Rome, and the Rise of American Fascism with Julian Davis," on the Entitled Opinions podcast. Host Robert Harrison is always engaging, and his guests bring a unique perspective to these 45-minute conversations. This time Davis, doctoral candidate in philosophy at Stanford and a well-known activist and attorney in San Francisco discuss the rise of "American Fascism."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, the phrase deserves the quotation marks, to point out that this concept has a uniquely American flavor with surprising roots in antiquity. It's an involved discussion, and might demand a second listen, but always challenging. And Davis is renowned for his ability to anticipate Donald Trump's victory in 2016, despite meeting a good deal of naysaying. He also states very plainly that, win or lose, we have not seen the last of Trump.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For reading, try "The Junkification of American Life: Why we want the wrong things," an essay by David Brooks in the New York Times. Settle in. While it is not a long read, the essay demands attention. Click <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/opinion/entertainment-junk-psychology.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Extra credit assignment: "<em>In The Room</em>"&nbsp;is an in-person, monthly interview series with Connecticut’s top elected officials. Host John Dankosky brings a new approach to political interviews, exploring the policy and the people behind the policy.</p>

<p>Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
