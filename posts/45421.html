<p>Come Sunday morning, I will be home for Mother's Day, while Mary is lending a hand with the new grandchild. Maybe I will decide to take a ride and visit. Time will tell. Earlier in the week, Mary and I made our way over to see the baby and mom and dad, who returned from the hospital (and big brother siblings, ages 4 and 2, who were with their other grandparents for a few days).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both mother and father were showing signs of wear--as expected. Dealing with a new baby's feeding schedule along with the happy tumult that ensues when life gets turned upside down in the best of ways as everyone adjusts leaves one weary, and happy, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's sweet to see how the siblings can be so attentive, gentle and understanding, too, while trying to maintain their little places in this new world. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Mary was eager to see the new grandchild, but she was also ending the legislative session with very late nights, often arriving home after midnight. The last day of the session came and went Wednesday, and she was up early, more than ready to see the baby, on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>More and more the student protests appear to be different from the ones we see being reported on, so finding alternative perspective is key toward getting the big picture. President Biden made a short speech this week that acknowledged different perspectives. As always, nuance is important, so his podcast from Michael Moore, "Ep. 317: President Biden's Political Science Theater 3000 ((a running commentary on free speech and the “rule of law)." caught my eye.</p>

<p>It's not difficult to understand where Moore is coming from. At the same time, it makes sense to listen to what he has to say, particularly in this creative approach to the president's comments on free speech. Oftentimes, we miss the nuances--not out of malice, but perhaps out of fear that things might be too complicated. I think we are a lot more complicated than we let on. In this instance, it's important to understand the nuances, so we have a better grip on the big picture.

<p>Adam Tooze, whom I mentioned last week with his own commentary on divestment, was referred to in this Capitalisn't podcast which also raised the issue of divestment in the context of student demands on campuses across the country, "The Economics of Student Protests."

<p>There is more on Trump v. United States. For the latest audio and a transcript, consult the Supreme Court website by clicking <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">here</a>. Scroll down the page to the box where the case is featured and choose your delivery method.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for reading, there is The Forward, which has articles and commentary about the protests and the situation in Israel. Click <a href="https://forward.com/tag/campus/">here</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am back to "IDA: A Sword Among Lions," the 659-page biography (not including notes and selected bibliography) about Ida B. Wells. At the top left of the front cover, there is another description, "Ida B. Wells and the Campaign Against Lynching." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While taking on a book of this length is daunting, especially in this age of texts and tweets, "Ida" reads quickly because the author does a great job of providing pertinent details and content within a personal story that is surprisingly current. Many of the issues that Wells faces in late 1800s through the first half of the 20th century are still with us. The Bristol Public Library has a copy. If it has been checked out, the book can be requested through interlibrary loan.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
