<p>A free food scrap recycling program for Bristol residents will begin a pilot phase July 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Food scraps can be converted into compost, which improves soil quality, reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, helps to retain water in the soil, and reduces soil erosion,” said Public Works director Raymond Rogozinski, in the release announcing the program. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rogozinski added that backyard compost piles and bins are limited in the types of foods that might be included. With this program, all food scraps may be used.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two-gallon kitchen compost bins with compostable bags are available at the Bristol Public Works office on the second floor of city hall, although residents may use their own bags or containers to collect and transport food waste.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Food scrap collection bins will be placed at the City Yard, located at 95 Vincent P Kelley Rd, where Blue Earth of Hartford will collect the food scraps and haul them to Quantum Biopower, a state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection-approved anaerobic digester in Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 21 days, Quantum can convert the food scraps into compost, as well as converting the methane byproduct inside the facility into biogas that generates electricity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is a cooperative effort between the Bristol Public Works, Reworld (formerly Covanta) and Blue Earth Compost of Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acceptable items include fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry and bones, fish/shellfish and shells, dairy products, bread, pasta, rice, grains, eggs, eggshells, chips and snacks, nuts and seeds, left over and spoiled food, coffee grounds, tea bags (no staples), paper towels and napkins used for food production (not for cleaning), cut flowers and pet food (no pet waste). Click <a href="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/food-waster-collection-flyer.jpg">here</a> for a flyer with more information.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ultimate goal is to reduce the amount of tonnage incinerated by removing food from the trash. Other surrounding towns, such as West Hartford are participating in similar food scrap recycling programs, according to the announcement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pays to have municipal solid waste incinerated at the Reworld facility. Data from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) states that about 22 percent of the waste stream is food. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
