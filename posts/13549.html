<p>BRISTOL - The postseason has arrived for our scholastic teams in town as dates and places have been set for boys and girls tennis and lacrosse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol’s top athletes are ready to roll in the 2022 CIAC playoffs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting in Class L girls tennis, No. 11 Bristol Central (9-5) travels to No. 6 Wethersfield (14-5) on May 31 for first round play at 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A possible second round opponent for the Rams is No. 3 Newington. That match would commence on June 1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Rams aren’t the only squad in action from the Mum City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, the Bristol boys lacrosse coop, ranked 13th in the Class L fray, has a home match against No. 20 Fairfield Warde (8-8) in a qualifying showdown on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Bristol contingent advances, the squad travels to No. 4 New Milford on June 1 for first round play at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in girls lacrosse, both Central and Bristol Eastern have qualified for the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Class L, No. 22 Norwich Free Academy (7-9-0) battles No. 11 Central (10-4-1) in a qualifying round match as the Rams earned a home seed off its outstanding season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is at 4 p.m. on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victor takes on No. 6 South Windsor on Tuesday at 5 p.m. in a first round bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in Class M play, No. 18 Eastern (7-9-0) battles at No. 15 St. Joseph (9-7-0) on Friday at 3:30 p.m. in a tournament qualifying match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner then gets to square off against No. 2 Foran (15-1) on Tuesday at 5 (it does not say a.m. or p.m. On that same day, No. 10 Daniel Hand battles No. 7 Simsbury on Tuesday at <em>5 a.m.</em> according to the CIAC website. Bring your coffee…)</p>
