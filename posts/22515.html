<p>BRISTOL - There will be better days ahead for the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team over the second half of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately on Tuesday evening, that wasn’t going to be one of those days for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers bumped up against CCC power Conard and dropped a tough 46-28 interdivisional decision to fall to 7-9 on the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Wolves improved to 12-3 overall, winning their third consecutive game and five of its past six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard’s Emily Knowles led all scorers with 23 points, Callie Cosgrove added 12, and Courtney McPhee nabbed 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No other players scored for the Red Wolves that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh led the scoring charge for Eastern with seven points, Taigan Parent netted six while the returning Jayle Evins-Mosley contributed five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury added four points for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The programs traded hoops over the first two minutes of the game as the programs jockeyed for position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Udoh opened the scoring with two hoops, followed by a Vanessa Drury drive for a basket, as the Lancers led 6-5 early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Conard was tough on defense, hit the offensive glass, put up concussive points, and off that one-point deficit, the visitors made its run to take the lead for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Wolves went on an 8-0 jaunt – making it a 13-6 game – before two Drury charity tosses trimmed the deficit to five with 1:52 remaining in the stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers trailed 15-8 after one quarter but was shutout from scoring during second period play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard outscored Eastern 12-0 over the second stanza and at the half, the Red Wolves held an imposing 31-8 edge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent kicked in a hoop at the 5:12 mark of the third quarter, breaking the scoreless streak, but Conard continued its onslaught as Red Wolves scooped up a 40-15 advantage after three periods of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers outscored Conard 13-6 over the final eight minutes of the evening but in the end, the home squad absorbed a tough 18-point loss with a date against Farmington (Friday, 6 p.m.) on deck in Bristol.</p>
