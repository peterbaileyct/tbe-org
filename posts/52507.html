<p>America is at a crossroads with this election. We have a choice between preserving democracy or going the way the former president is advocating -- fascism!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his rambling, often times incoherent speeches, he heaps praise upon despots like Russia's Putin and Hungary's Orban. He doesn't offer visions of hope or a brighter future but rather professes his desire for revenge. He offers amnesty for his supporters who attacked our capitol where hundreds of police officers were injured and some died. He fails to accept defeat and his VP running mate has indicated he would have violated the constitution that VP Pence upheld.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The platform of the former president is all spelled out in Project 2025. There are no illusions with the intent of the MAGA party should they take power!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I urge my fellow citizens to support hope over hate and vote for the Harris/Walz team and the two non-MAGA candidates for the General Assembly: incumbent Mary Fortier and first time candidate Mary Rydingsward.</p>
