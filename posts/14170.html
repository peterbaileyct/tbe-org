<p>The Central Connecticut Conference, in terms of softball, is one of the strongest leagues in all the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had two squads who played in the CCC and represented the sport to its fullest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern made deep postseason jaunts before the season was said and done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of state rankings and polls for the teams from the Mum City, no one noticed those Bristol programs for most of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams racked up a sterling 17-3 regular season ledger, losing just two games by a single run and dropped a game (three in the end) to Class LL champion Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And no one noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers made a 10-10 regular season splash in the CCC - a very good record going up against several state powers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And no one noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But after two tremendous state tournament runs by both programs, voters from the GameTimeCT Top 10 Softball Poll were enlightened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone noticedâ€¦and it was about time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central finally cracked the top-10 to end the season while Eastern was also shown a bit of love in the poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After earning enough points for the 14th ranking in the poll to start tournament play, Central - ranked at No. 5 in Class LL field - picked off Wilton, Cheshire, Trumbull, and top-ranked Danbury, to finish the season at 22-5 and at No. 6 in the poll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over on King Street, the Lancers defeated a few top-ranked squads on their way to an impressive 13-11 finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the points earned in the poll, Eastern ended up in 19th place which was an excellent finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers defeated Jonathan Law and East Haven in Class L tournament play, two top-10 programs for most of the year, proved that the players and team over at Eastern could hang with anyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And guess what?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of the year, the two programs from Bristol proved to be better than advertised.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everyone noticed.</p>
