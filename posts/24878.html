<p>The 55-and-over-residential housing project proposed for Gloria Dei Forest received a positive response from neighbors at a Zoning Commission meeting earlier this month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every neighbor along the perimeter of the project, proposed by a local developer operating under Eastwood Meadow LLC, provided a letter in favor of the project, and many showed up in person to speak in favor of the project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the two dissenting voices was one from a long-time congregant of Gloria Dei Church, who made a plea for saving the forest, since it is the only open space parcel on East side of the Bristol border between Routes 6 and 72.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eric Madsen, who formed the group, Save the Gloria Dei Church Forest, spoke briefly and submitted his comments to be included in the meeting minutes. He addressed the value of open space, the lack of open space on this side of the city and appealed to the developer to consider donating the space to the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Madsen also alluded to the campaign by the developer to win over the residents as one that included worse case scenarios if this one did not prevail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his closing comments the attorney representing Eastwood Meadows, Tim Furey, from the local law firm Furey, Donovan, Tracy and Daly, responded to Madsen, stating that the developer would not be donating the property and that the space would be developed with the current plan or an alternative, for better or worse, and that the plan before the commission was a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The plan before the commission had been revised from the original and included revisions addressing concerns of the neighbors, according to Furey. For instance, the original plan included several buildings. The current one included one structure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the current plan addressed drainage problems that have persisted in the area surrounding the six-acre plus forest as well as a concerns about preserving the wooded area around the perimeter of the property, which would add another layer of trees as a buffer and amenity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The commission did receive letters against the project proceeding from residents in the surrounding areas concerned with drainage and the lack of open space, as well as traffic concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opposing letters were submitted directly to the chair of the commission well in advance of the April 10 regular meeting and before the revised plan had been submitted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Action on the application by the Zoning Board was moved to the regular May 8 meeting, since several issues have yet to be addressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of them has to do with a traffic study requested by Plainville, which shares Camp Street and where residents will enter and exit the project. Another has to do with a study by city engineers to determine the impact of run-off upon the neighborhoods abutting the project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A third had to do with access by residents from French Street. According to Furey, there will be a gated access on French Street to allow for maintenance of detention ponds, periodically, but no access by residents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A final issue raised during the meeting by neighbors involved the issue of the status of caregivers, who might be under the age of 55, who by Federal statute might be eligible to reside after the passing of the person who received their care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The project, for 74 residences, abuts Camp Street, Gloria Dei Lutheran church property and French and Seminary streets. The outlet entrance and exit for residences as currently proposed is on Camp Street, a border street with Plainville. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from Furey, the board heard from the following: Scott Hesketh, a traffic engineer with F.A. Hesketh &amp; Associates, Inc., East Granby; Charles Talmadge, the applicant's planner, of Development Planning Solutions, Bristol, and; and Bryan Panico, of Harry E. Cole &amp; Sons, an engineering, surveying and planning firm in Plantsville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hesketh provided information from a traffic study that, he concluded, would not add substantially to the traffic flow on Camp Street, nor would it create further impact to the connecting streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talmadge was available to answer questions about the project in general as well as to note further concerns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Panico addressed the drainage issues and included a detailed description of the system that would be installed.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
