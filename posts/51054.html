<p>Bristol Police were among police from several towns and cities that took into custody an individual involved with an incident in Bristol that occurred earlier in July where a Bristol Police officer was nearly struck as the individual drove away from the scene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officers and detectives from the Bristol as well as Glastonbury, Manchester and East Hartford Police Departments, with assistance of members of the East Central Narcotics Task Force, took Kamron Mathis, 23, into custody as he left an East Hartford address under surveillance on Aug. 27, according to the Bristol Department release this afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 7, at about 10 p.m., two Bristol Police officers happened upon an apparent disturbance while on routine patrol on Prospect Street. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the officers stepped out of their patrol car to investigate, a male involved in the disturbance entered his vehicle and immediately fled the scene, nearly striking an officer in the street. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Efforts were made to stop the suspect vehicle but were ultimately discontinued due to the dangerous and erratic driving behavior of the suspect, and his clear disregard for the safety of other people on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police investigation determined the identity of the suspect to be Mathis, a former resident of Manchester. Additional information uncovered that Mathis was staying at an address in East Hartford, and that he had several outstanding warrants for his arrest from Manchester and Glastonbury (for charges unrelated to Bristol's incident). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following up on this information, Bristol Police acquired an arrest warrant for Mathis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Thursday, Sept. 12, Mathis was charged by Bristol Police for the following: criminal attempt to assault a police officer, interfering with an officer, reckless endangerment 1st degree (2 counts), breach of Peace 2nd degree, reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit, operating without a driver’ license, speeding (>70mph), improper Turn and failure to obey stop sign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mathis was arraigned at New Britain Superior Court, and he remains in the custody of the Department of Corrections for these charges as well as for several criminal offenses from the other towns’ cases, according to the release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The release ends with the following statement: "The Bristol Police Department wishes to express gratitude to the neighboring agencies that assisted in apprehending Mathis safely, as well as to members of the public for providing information in this case, and for supporting our officers as they strive to do their jobs safely."</p>
