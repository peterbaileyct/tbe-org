<p>Community members gathered for a celebration of creativity and togetherness on Saturday at the Bristol Bazaar for the All-Heart Art Exhibition. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> “It’s so nice to have everyone sharing the same space and connecting through art,” said Board of Education Commissioner Maria Pirro Simmons. “We have so many amazing featured artists here expressing themselves in such a unique way, and it’s exciting to see their perspectives."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simmons, who organized the event, said that she was happy to see so many members of the community connecting.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The afternoon gathering provided a platform for artists of all ages to answer the thought-provoking question, "What does living in an All-Heart city look like to you?"  </p>

<p>Eight-year-old Elliott Johnson paired a positive message and autumn colors into her original work of art. Encircled in an array of maple and elm leaves, the West Bristol student pieced together the words “Be Kind” in bright burgundy foliage. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“First I got all the leaves,” Johnson said, “then I put everything together. I like all the pretty colors of all the leaves.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chippens Hill Middle School student Kaidyn Rasmussen-Tuller drew inspiration for his work of art from his family. His artwork combined powerful visuals of hands interlocking near a rainbow heart with the words “Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one come to you without leaving happier,” written underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He said that the lighter skin is for him, the darker skin is for his brother and sister, and the heart is for his dads.” Democratic Town Committee Chair Ken Rasmussen-Tuller said of his son’s artwork.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the artistic showcases, Holly Pugliese, Bristol's 2024 Teacher of the Year, and Joan Pelkey, Bristol's 2024 Paraprofessional of the Year, were celebrated for their contributions to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Republican and democratic city leadership were invited to attend the All-Heart Art Exhibit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simmons stated that she feels that it’s important for city leaders from all political parties to put aside their differences and engage in a positive way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among those in attendance were State Sen. Henri Martin, BoE Commissioners Shelby Pons, Jill Fitzsimons-Bula and Kristen Giantonio, City Councilors Sue Tyler and Jackie Olsen, Mayoral Candidate Scott Rosado, City Council candidates Mark Dickau and Andrew Rasmussen-Tuller, BoE candidate Corey Nagle and Former Mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I really like that while there are people running for office here today, this is not a political event,” Simmons said. “We’re all serving our communities and we’re all people first.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
