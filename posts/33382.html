<p>EAST HARTFORD – The UConn football team started its season-opening drive with zest on Thursday evening, going 12 plays and 75 yards, capped by a Victor Rosa 18 yard TD burst as the Huskies nabbed an early edge against N.C. State from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium in East Hartford.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the UConn defense had a lapse or two and staggered offensively over fourth period play as the Wolfpack wrangled up a 24-14 victory in a non-conference affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game, witnessed by 36,526 fans, was the opener for both teams and Rosa, the former Bristol Central High School standout, picked up right where he left off in 2022-23.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa cashed in on two touchdown rushes and led the Huskies in carries (9) and rushing yards (99), just missing out on a 100 yard outing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides the 18 yard TD jaunt, Rosa also made a punishing 71-yard touchdown splash with 2:04 to play to trim the deficit to 17-14 in the third quarter.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UCONN did not inch any closer from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa averaged 11.0 yards-per-carry that night – leading all rushers in total yardage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa’s 18 yard touchdown rush came from the right side of the field, splitting his way right through a huge seam in the N.C. State line, to give the locals a 7-0 edge with 8:21 left to go in the first frame before the visiting aggression notched 17 straight points to capture the lead for good.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Delbert Mimms one yard TD jaunt made it a 17-7 contest with 2:22 remaining in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, on the ensuing drive, Rosa took off on the first play, following a few blockers, breaking through the crowd, and shaking two defenders as he sprinted down the UConn sideline for a 71-yard explosion – chopping the deficit to 17-14 with 2:04 remaining in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rosa flipped his way into the end zone on the TD plunge, drawing a penalty in the process, which forced the Huskies to kickoff from the 20-yard line as the Wolfpack made a big return and started the series in UConn territory.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Wolfpack scored a four play, 27 yard scoring drive as Brennan Armstrong made an eight yard carry into the end zone to make it a double-figure affair once again with 34 seconds left in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On UConn’s final 18 plays, the offense nabbed just 48 total yards and on an interception thrown by quarterback Joseph Fagnano with 54 seconds left to play, the Huskies ended up dropping a hard-fought 24-14 decision to open the campaign.</p>

<p>Next week, Rosa and the Huskies are on the road at Georgia State on September 9 – looking to even their record in a big clash.</p>
