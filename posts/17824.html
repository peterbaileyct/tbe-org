<p>On Monday, TBE sent an election questionnaire to all candidates for local state offices. When the candidates send us their replies, we will print them for the readers of The Bristol Edition to see.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope to have full coverage of the 2022 campaign as the final month has begun. We will also try engage the candidates in follow up questions and an examination of issues important to Bristol.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of our initial request:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Bristol&nbsp;Edition, Bristol's online community newspaper, is beginning its 2022 election coverage. With that in mind, we are asking you to submit a candidate photo, bio, list of endorsements, and an explanation of what you consider to be the three biggest issues of the 2022 campaign and why.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>The photo should be 1500x2100 pixels at 300 pixels per inch (equal to 5x7 print).</strong></li><li><strong>The bio should be no more than 150 words.</strong></li><li><strong>Each endorsement on your list should include a link to confirm the endorsement.</strong></li><li><strong>Campaign issues should include a brief synopsis and statement explaining your reason for making this a priority.</strong></li><li><strong>In addition, please provide an email or phone number where you can be reached to confirm and clarify all statements and where you can be reached to comment on future stories.</strong></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We sincerely hope that all the candidates will respond. Here are the candidates who were contacted:</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em></p>
