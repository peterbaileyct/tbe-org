<p>BRISTOL - After a 10 point loss to Hall of West Hartford to open the season on January 3, the Bristol boys swimming co-op earned its first victory of the year on Friday - downing the squad from Enfield/Suffield/Ellington by a 97-83 final.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest, held from the Dennis Malone Aquatics Center in Bristol, saw the best swimmers from Bristol Central, Bristol Eastern and St. Paul Catholic combine forces to hold off the grouping from the Enfield area.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol contingent earned numerous first place tallies up and down the line-up.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored first place in the medley relay as the grouping of Davis Kroll, Ryleigh Dionne, Tommy Massotti, and Aidan Palaj won in 1:50.57.</p>

<p>In the 200 Freestyle, Palaj was back at it again, winning the event in 1:53.76 while in the diving challenge, senior Jedric Sutula had the best dive of the afternoon for first place.</p>
