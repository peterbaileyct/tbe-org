<p>BRISTOL - Despite its ending against Bristol Central on Thanksgiving, the Bristol Eastern football team put together its best campaign in nearly a decade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers finished the season a 6-4 and was just out of the reach of playoff qualification this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had a good year,” said Eastern coach Anthony Julius. “[To get] over .500 is always a goal. We did a lot of good things.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern finished 12th in the Class MM field but was in contention all season long off its sterling 3-0 start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad improved its win total from three to six wins over last season, showing the tremendous growth of the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of offense, the Lancers wrangled up 20.9 points-per-game - the most since the Kingstreeters went 7-4 in 2014 (270 points, 24.5 points-per-game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior back Jaiden Fore was excellent from the get-go, compiling 1,189 rushing yards (4.8 yards-per-carry) to go along with 15 touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He completely toasted RHAM (34-0) on October 28 for 37 carries, 200 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had 131 yards against Farmington, nabbed 156 the following week against Hartford Public, zipped up 141 versus South Windsor and toasted Avon for 183 yards on just 16 carries - good for four TDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Fore had six games of 131-plus yards this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Zavecz (26 carries, 236 yards) averaged 9.1 yards-per-carry and two touchdowns and did everything he could when Julius gave him the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 79 yard rush against Hartford Public was the longest by program while quarterback Kamden Laprise averaged 3.9 yards-per-carry on 34 attempts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 62 yard scamper for a TD against Bristol Central on Thanksgiving was a career high, leading to Eastern’s Offensive Player of the Game honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Laprise, the junior competitor was final healthy enough to play a full season and he made the most of his opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He connected on nearly 50-percent of his passes (60-for-122, 778 yards, five touchdowns), threw just three interceptions while getting sacked just a handful of times. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He tossed for 134 yards in the 27-13 win over Hartford Public, scooped in 107 in the 22-0 shutout at Rocky Hill, passed for 110 in the 10-point loss at Edwin O. Smith and collected a total of 157 yards in rushing and passing yards on Thanksgiving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His scrabbling skills, along with his poise, will help the Lancers next season when Laprise is a senior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase Dauphinee, before he hurt his hand, was catching passes left and right, and still managed to lead the program in receptions (15 catches, 211 yards).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 14-point victory against Hartford Public, Dauphinee caught four passes a career-high 120 yards including a 79-yard completion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zion Otero battled the injury bug but over the second half of the year but still managed to lead the squad in touchdown receptions (three) while making 10 catches for 126 yards overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mikey Sherrill (seven catches, 143 yards, TD) and Noah Albert (7-79) tied for third on the squad in receptions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Corvo (six catches, 61 yards, touchdown) also helped keep the chains moving in the passing game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Defense&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, there was an amazing defensive component.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the likes of Adam Zavecz (73 tackles), Dauphinee, Mikey Sherill, Ryan Zavecz, Lincoln Bashaw, Hunter Wells, and Randy DeNoto, opponents were held to just 10.4 points-per-game as the defense was up to the task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 104 points were the fewest opponents have scored against the Lancers in over 40 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1981, Eastern went 6-3 with two shutouts - one being an amazing 19-0 throttling versus Southington from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 104 points was the seventh fewest points allowed in program history while the three shutouts on the road was a new Eastern record.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers wrangled up nine interceptions as Alex Corvo and Bryce Bacote each scooped in three pickoffs apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern allowed opponents just under 4.0 yards-per-play and 26-of-93 on third down conversions (28-percent).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thanksgiving Blues</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern nearly came from behind to get Central on Thanksgiving but ended up falling 14-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the eighth straight loss against the Rams but despite the tough ending, the Kingstreeters had a great season and used the 2023 campaign as a building block for next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is the one that stings the most when you don’t finish the season on a high note,” said Julius of the lost to Central Thanksgiving. “It wasn’t due to lack of effort or anything like that. We just came up a little short today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Unfortunately, that’s kind of been the story over the last few years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Climbing the ladder</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off that six win season, Julius is now tied for fourth all-time for program victories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Julius is tied with Ed Swicklas with 17 wins and only a few coaches are in front of the duo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was able to surpass the crafty and clever Jack Krampitz (13-18 overall) to match Swicklas for fourth place. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only two men have coached Eastern in more games than Julius which includes Dave Mills (116 wins) who is the all-time program leader in victories (116) and games coached (242).</p>
