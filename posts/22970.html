<p>Come Sunday morning, the days will be getting longer, at least it appears that way, and, well, it’s only February but, do I dare say anything about you know what? I will let things slide (every pun intended).&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, Mary and I intended&nbsp;to take a walk down memory lane by ordering from Friendly’s--we both thought it would be fun to have a Swiss patty melt and a Fishamagig sandwich, sandwiches we used to order when Mary was away at college in Boston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was a change from the ordinary routine—a treat, since we don’t treat ourselves much, except for Friday night which is, has been, and will always be Pizza Friday.&nbsp;(Okay, there might be an exception, when we grab a sandwich from Tommy’s Place.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went online to check out the menu, and, what did I find? No, Swiss patty melt. Times change, and so do menus.</p>

<p>It was a long week and only appeared to be getting longer, when I decided to try a counterintuitive strategy to ease myself through. Two times this week, I started each day in silence, even to the point of driving to work, a 30- to 35-minute commute, in silence. No podcast. No radio.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The typical mornings, for me, start early, just after 4 a.m., when I rise write, meditate (centering prayer), exercise, wash out the CPAP equipment, shower and dress. Also, at some&nbsp;point each morning, I make two cups of tea—one for Mary and one for me. I leave hers on the kitchen table. I grab mine. Then, I drive off. And, typically, I listen to a podcast while I exercise and again for the drive to work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow, having held off on the podcasts and driving in silence I was feeling less rushed and more attentive on both days, and when the end of the week arrived, I was in a good place. I just might carry on with this new approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening/reading for the week. Even though I cut out the morning listening sessions on two days, I did manage to get through a couple of podcasts worth mentioning. The first is another Erza Klein Show episode, entitled “How Liberals—Yes, Liberals—are Hobbling Government.” It in Klein discusses with Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan and the former chief legal counsel to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, this phenomenon.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second, an episode of the This is Democracy podcast, entitled “Intelligence,” discusses how United States collects intelligence on China and Russia. Each episode begins with an original poem written by Zachary&nbsp;Suri, co-host and the son of Jeremi Suri, the other host. Guest John Sipher retired from the CIA in 2014.

<p>Late in the week, I talked with Neal Supranovich, our contact with the local American Legion. We had been exchanging emails about the upcoming Iwo Jima World War II Veterans Reunion at the Bristol Public library on Sunday, Feb. 19, 2 p.m. at the Bristol Public Library. Supranovich is pretty excited about the event, which will feature the presentation of a very special portrait to Joe Caminiti. The public is invited. The Legion’s Facebook page with information about the program is available by clicking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Seicheprey-Post-2-Bristol-CT-American-Legion-328768314244919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And, yes, Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano announced mid-week that he will be seeking re-election in November’s municipal elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last, three TBE regulars, Laura Bailey, Rit Carter and I headed to a Connecticut Foundation for&nbsp;Open Government (CFOG) event at the Elmwood Community Center on Thursday evening. The program featured the reporters behind five big news stories from last year. It was good hearing the reporters talk about their efforts as they followed their stories, sometimes over months. For a link to the CFOG page and a video of the event, click <a href="https://ctfog.org/programs/sbtbs2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
