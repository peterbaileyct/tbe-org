<p>BRISTOL – It was another day and another win for the Bristol Junior American Legion baseball team on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when winless EMH came to the Mum City for a Zone 3 bout, the same team left town with another loss on its docket.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 belted EHA for four first inning runs on its way to an outstanding 8-2 triumph – moving to 9-1 overall - from Riley Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third straight triumph for the locals as the program remains just a half game out of first place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington (10-1) after losing to Bristol about 10 days ago, hasn’t lost since – has won five straight games and is the current Zone 3 leader. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is a perfect 6-0 from home, averaging 8.9 runs-per-game for the top scoring tally in zone play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol nearly duplicated that average on Tuesday, but no one is complaining about the ultimate result.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game was the last home contest for the locals for a little bit as four of the squad’s next five games will be played on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Drew Martineau went a strong five innings on the mound, throwing just 63 pitches to earn the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack Ericksen and Brian Grabowski each threw an inning for the victors, saving the arm of Martineau for another day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 ramped up several big hits on the day as Caleb Simard (two walks, RBI), Gabe White, Brayden Schenck and Mason Harris (RBI) all got into the offensive flow against EHM.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Ryan Tyler and Ericksen each drew walks as the locals collected a double figure base-on-balls total.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manuel Feliciano lasted 2.1 innings for EHM, drawing a hard-luck loss and an early exit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 led by a 4-1 push through three innings and then scored runs over the fourth, fifth and sixth stanzas to increase its lead to seven at one point.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol scored twice in the fourth and once in the fifth and sixth frames to scoop up an 8-1 cushion, never looking back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Up next…</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 is on the road Thursday at Norwich (5:30 p.m.), goes to South Windsor on Saturday (Rotary Park, 3:30 p.m.) and travels to Waterford on Sunday (Waterford High School) right off Route 1 (hope you guys have some extra gas money for the trip) at high noon before returning home.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the holiday break, Bristol is home for a tilt against Zone 3 challenger Glastonbury on July 6 (5:30 p.m., Riley Park) as the locals finally returns back home.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Looking at the zone</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top three teams in Zone 3 (Torrington, Bristol and Waterford) are a combined 19-0 from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torrington is 7-0 while Waterford (9-3) is a perfect 6-0 from Waterford High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ellington (7-3) is in fourth place while Tri-County (8-4) are both 5-2 from their respective home sites.</p>
