<p>For Chippens Hill Middle School student Aidan Delgado, seeing Donovan Clingan up close and personal was an opportunity to see someone who is typically out of reach in a totally different way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Everyone always talks about him as if he is a really high person," Delgado, a member of the Purple Team, said. "It's nice to see he's a real person. We get to see him and we get to see who he really was. He's just really cool."</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan, the University of Connecticut men's basketball star and Bristol native, surprised students with a visit to his alma mater Wednesday morning as a Dunkin Donuts ambassador. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He officiated a basketball game between teachers--the Blue Team won 6-5--participated in a layup contest--he won, and answered questions from students--on whether he will be back for another season at UConn- let's take one season at a time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We get slide fun facts about him in our daily slide shows," Delgado said, referencing Clingan's influence at Chippens. "It's just nice to see him in the flesh."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Delago said he doesn't play basketball, but he did share a teacher of Clingan's, Mr. Reynolds.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eighth grader, who wore a knitted Dunkin hat from the free giveaways, said he plans to join the football team when he gets to Bristol Central High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan arrived to the roar of the students just after 10 a.m. After waving a greeting, he went directly to center court where he started the game between two teacher teams with a jump ball toss and watched some of his former teachers put on a show of their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Rivers from iHeart radio (KC101 and Kiss-FM) was the emcee over the morning's program which had several shifts, since the students piled into the gym in different groupings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Dunkin', 1,500 donuts were distributed--750 boxes of donuts, packed in twos; Dunkin' winter hats, sunglasses, cobranded Dunkin'/UConn t-shirts and winter socks. All students, staff and teachers received $5 gift cards. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of the festivities, Dunkin' created photo donuts with Donovan and the Chippens Hill Middle School logo on them for Clingan.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
