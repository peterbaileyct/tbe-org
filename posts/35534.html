<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time a Bristol Eastern cross-country team was able to topple the powerful program from Bristol Central was back in 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the past 19 years, the Rams have won every Bristol City Series title bout -- completely dominating the competition between Eastern and St. Paul Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But on Thursday, when Central, Eastern and St. Paul Catholic gathered for the annual race, the Kingstreeters finally hit the pay window for a long overdue collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern swept the day, posting a 24-31 victory over rival Bristol Central while spinning St. Paul Catholic 20-40.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams ended up defeating the Falcons 21-39.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It feels awesome,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski of the win. “I’m so happy for those guys. I mean, they have worked so hard all summer, all season. Last year, we lost by a point and since then, it’s really been their goal to come here and finish the job.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They raced great.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, the day belonged to Central senior Patrick Wininger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He led from wire-to-wire, squaring away a tremendous time of 18:13 as his first-place finish marked the 20th straight meet that the individual boy's championship went to a harrier from Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Wininger’s first-ever title as former winner Frankie Porrini -- who took the past two City Series championships -- was looking on with pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Honestly, when a really think about it, I look at myself back in freshman year and I think about who I was person, as a student, as an athlete and I look at myself now and I never would have thought in a million years that I would be winning the Bristol City Championship,” said Wininger. “It’s a great honor. It’s a great honor to be the twentieth straight Bristol Central champion for the race. I feel very honored, and I feel very blessed on this day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a very awesome feeling.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as a team, the day belonged to the Lancers as five of the first nine runners who crossed the finish line were wearing blue and white colors.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matt Doherty (18:46.6), an outstanding senior from St. Paul Catholic, earned second place, never letting Wininger get completely away until late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Eastern salted away the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outstanding sophomore Jase Koczur (third place, 19:24.6) held off fellow teammate Cole Beland (fourth, 19:27), making a huge splash in the end to get the Lancers’ second runner across.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Naythan Pellerin (fifth, 19:30) is an exciting freshman who took fifth place while Eastern junior Kyle Kelley (sixth, 19:46) and fellow junior Brendan Tartarelli (seventh, 19:59.7) were the third and fourth runners to hit the finish line for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central senior Rowan Hennessey (20:01.7) ended up in eighth place and to make it academic, Eastern junior Aidan Gezelman (20:38.5) finished in ninth -- helping the Kingstreeters win the city series championship for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been fortunate. We were going for our twentieth [straight] team championship today,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “We missed out on that, but we had our twentieth individual win in a row. That really says a lot about our program.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So, I’m really proud of that.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two freshmen finished after Gezelman with Cody Wilson (St. Paul Catholic, 10th, 20:58.3) and Noah Pellerin (Bristol Central, 11th, 20:58.3) placing extremely well in their first ever City Series challenge while Central’s Nicola DiMatteo (12th, 21:12) showed a little grit on the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Dylan Prince (13th, 21:19.8), Central’s Braydan Dwyer (14th, 21:35) and St. Paul Catholic’s Aiden Conklin (15th, 21:36.4) helped to round out a tough top 15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The race was a good one as Central truly pushed Eastern on the course, but the Lancers were able to triumph in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hats off to Bristol Central,” said Ryskowski. “They really made it tough.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the first bridge for the first time around the course, Wininger was already comfortably in front of everyone while Doherty and Koczur were hanging around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there was a three-pack of runners from both Central and Eastern that eventually dissolved a bit while Wilson was just behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wininger was in complete control after running back towards the amphitheater for the second time as the group behind him spaced out somewhat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the bridge towards the skate park for the second time, Wininger’s competition was not in earshot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same crew was in tow as Doherty was ahead of the pack, battling for second place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the event, Wininger, proudly displaying his Bristol Central jersey, was an easy winner in 18:13 while Doherty trailed about half-a-minute behind to make a great finish as the runner-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But spots three, four, six, seven and nine belonged to the Lancers - securing the seven-point win over Central - as Eastern earned a well-deserved City Series Championship.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m so happy for our guys,” said Ryskowski. “They deserve it. I’m just happy that they could win one.”</p>
