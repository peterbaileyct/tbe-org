<p>The final two teams are set for the Connecticut 19U American Legion Baseball state championship this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a best of three series, Waterford (Zone 6, 27-3 overall) and Danbury (Zone 4, 23-9) will battle to see which program advances to the Northeast Regional â€“ earning a chance to play in the American Legion World Series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game one commences on Friday at 6:30 p.m. from Palmer Field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The teams will play again on Saturday (1 p.m.) and if the series is tied up at 1-1 after the second game, a tie-breaking final commences about 45 later in an immediate winner-take-all rematch.</p>

<h3>Not an easy road</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The representative from Connecticut will have faced all the elements to get to the Northeast Regional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford outscored the competition 16-5 over Pod C play to advance to the Super Regional but played two tough games against the program from Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 17, Waterford needed eight innings to get by Bristol (1-0) and then in the rematch on July 20, the top seed advanced in the postseason via its 7-5 victory over Post 2 from Waterford High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Danbury took a different route, falling to EHM (3-2) in opening round play in the Southern Division but won four straight to advance to the next round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad scored 50 runs over those four final contests -- dropping EHM (10-1) in the last game of Pod H.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Super Regional Bracket</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Middletown, Danbury went 3-0 as the squad outscored the competition 22-2 to qualify for the state title tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of the state, Waterford also went a slick 3-0 to earn the series against Danbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like its counterparts, Waterford allowed just two runs but just posted eight over play from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 161 defeated Greenwich and Stamford by identical 2-1 scores and then shutout Stamford 4-0 to end its play in Bristol to get to the best-of-three series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford was the top seeded team in Super Regional play while Danbury (No. 7) got out of the bracket with a dominant offensive onslaught, finishing the regular season two games behind Zone 4 winner Stamford (18-6 regular season).</p>
