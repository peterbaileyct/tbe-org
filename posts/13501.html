<p>BRISTOL – In a city series baseball game in Bristol, all the big stars usually come out to shine.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for Bristol Central, that star was Frank Spirito as the pitcher was simply outstanding against Eastern – collecting 13 strikeouts while allowing just three hits – as the Rams defeated the Lancers 8-1 from Muzzy Field in Bristol on Monday&nbsp;night.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended the regular season at 9-11, sweeping the Lancers, while Eastern fell to 7-11 with a couple games to go.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito had a no-hitter going through 5.1 innings and only allowed three late singles over another remarkable performance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was unbelievable,” said Central coach Bunty Ray of Spirito. “He’s been unbelievable down the stretch. He’s now starting to realize how to pitch. Him and [assistant] coach [Mitch] Rossi are on the same page. His development over the year is ridiculous. He’s not only just throwing fastballs. He’s throwing breaking balls, changeups, [and] he’s using two seamers. He’s starting to command all his pitches.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I can’t say enough about what he’s done with Mitch. Mitch was one of my best and now Frank is heading in that direction as well.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had runners on base in four of the seven innings but was only able to cobble together the lone run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Central had 10 hits from the third inning on after Eastern starter Ryan Maglio (3-4 on the season) allowed just one run on four hits through four tough frames of work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They put the ball in play,” said Eastern coach Steve Gaudet of Central. “We had a slip in left field [on a double by Central’s JT Clark] and they bleed us to death a little bit with some well-placed hits.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito threw a flawless first inning, racking up two Ks, while Maglio went 1-2-3 as well as the contest quickly moved into the second stanza.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening the top of the second, Spirito had thrown three consecutive strikeouts but Ben D’Amato walked to put Eastern’s first runner on base.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the crafty chucker ended up fanning the side as the game remained a scoreless affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went three up and three down in the bottom of the second off strong pitching by Maglio as neither team had generated a hit to that point of the showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central chucker remained in a groove, tallying strikeout six and seven in the third frame, before the Rams finally got the game’s first hit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the bottom of the third, Zach Vanasse cracked a grounder up the middle that was stopped – with no real chance to get the hustling runner going to first base – as Central had a man on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Allan (2-for-3) grounded out to third for a fielder’s choice before Eastern’s Conor McCormick made a slick diving catch in centerfield to snuff out the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito threw to just one over the minimum – fanning eight along the way – as the chucker was coasting through four innings of the scoreless stalemate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a good pitcher,” said Gaudet of Spirito. “He pitched very well. He did an outstanding job.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the fourth, Central finally added a run to the scoreboard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clark (2-for-3, walk) dropped a slicing double to left to start the rally and then the runner scored via two wild pitches as the home team etched up a 1-0 push through four – seizing the momentum of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was getting frustrating over there, just the bad at-bats, one after another” said Ray about earlier in the game. “I knew it would just take a couple baserunners and maybe something else and I think when we scored that first run, you could just see everyone [breathe]. Credit [Maglio]. He was keeping us off-balanced but it was just going to take something [to get us going].” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito (1-for-2, walk) helped his own cause with a sharp single between shortstop and third base while Aiden Lopez (2-for-3) singled as well, putting two on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Kuzniar grounded out to short as Eastern keep it a 1-0 game heading into the top of the fifth frame.&nbsp;L</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D’Amato walked for the second time to open the fifth and Gabe White came in to pinch run.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>White stole second to get into scoring position but Maglio struck out looking, three players then attempted to field Rio Fernandez’s pop-up behind first base – caught by Kuzniar – and Spirito nabbed strikeout number 10 as Central was cruising.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When Eastern put the ball in play, to our credit for the most part, we made most of” the plays said Ray. “Spirito did a great job.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allan slapped out a one-out base hit to left in the bottom of the fifth, stealing second, as Central was about to break the game open.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christian Stafford then sent a flair to right, putting runners on the corners, and&nbsp;from there, Anthony Santilli simply put the ball into play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was booted at shortstop, allowing Allan to scoot home, and off a base hit by Clark, Stafford scored and quickly, it was a 3-0 contest as Gaudet went to Owen Myers on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A double steal put two runners in scoring position and Ryan Ring’s tally to left produced another run – making it 4-0 – while Spirito was intentionally walked to load things up for the force.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez then added an RBI single to the till as Central’s cushion reached 5-0, all with just one out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Kuzniar grounded out to second, Ring came home to score – making it a 6-0 contest as Central had batted around.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That big inning really, really gave us confidence we needed down the stretch,” said Ray. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the sixth, Eastern finally broke Spirito’s no-no with an infield hit from McCormick that died in the grass going towards third base as the Kingstreeters finally showed some offensive life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaydon Churchill then dropped a ball into center for a hit and quickly, Eastern had men on the corners with one gone.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCormick later scored on a wild pitch as Eastern chopped the deficit to 6-1 through six.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open Central’s portion of the sixth, Allan hustled out an infield hit and made it to second via a steal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford reached first on a fielding error at second in an attempt to possibly double-up Allan at first but the ball was bobbled and both runners were safe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clark later walked and the lead runner scored off Ring’s grounder to short – pushing Central’s lead out to 7-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another wild pitch led to a run, making it an 8-1 game, and Caleb Molinsky came into pitch for the Lancers with the bases juiced and two outs but got the final out of the sixth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the contest for the Lancers, Jose Feliciano was plunked by a pitch by Spirito and Kamden Laprise pinch ran for the hitter.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Babin then unleashed an infield hit to third base as two were on for Eastern but Spirito ended the game with K number 13 and off one final groundout, Central picked up a big 8-1 triumph to end regular season play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve played a lot of tight games” this year said Ray. “It was nice to be able to have a little bit of a lead and breathe a little bit.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the final home game for Central seniors Zach Vanasse, JT Clark, and Bryan Capezzone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Playing in their last BC/BE game for Eastern was Cole Latko, Elliot Norris, Conor McCormick, and captain Jaydon Churchill.&nbsp;</p>
