<p>NEW BRITAIN - The duo of Frankie Porrini and Tre Blair represented themselves and the Bristol Central Boys Track and Field program extremely well from the New England Championships from Willow Brook Park in New Britain on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both athletes were in thick of things at the ultra-competitive event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini, a tremendous distance runner, ended up seizing 18th place in the 1600 meters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His finish of 4:23.03 was an excellent showing in New Britain while in the field, Blair was tremendous in the challenging triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair made a mighty leap of 43 feet, eight inches to seize a spot in the top ten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, his jump was good for tenth place over a very crowded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next spring, the combination of Porrini and Blair are going to be the leaders of another CCC South contender for the boys track &amp; field program at Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Frankie and Tre are both juniors who have had outstanding seasons!” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “Tre equaled his best jump of the season and qualified for nationals. He will probably attend NeW Balance Nationals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania next weekend. Although Frankie didn’t have his best race today, he has had an outstanding junior season and looks to finish strong at Nike Nationals in Eugene, Oregon next weekend. Frankie will be running the 2k steeplechase at nationals and possibly the 800 or 1600.”</p>

<p>For Blair, the NeW Balance Nationals commence from June 16-19 from Franklin Field.</p>
