<p>Ethan Stepputtis tossed a complete game shutout leading the Woodland Hawks to a 7-0 win over the St. Paul Falcons last evening at Woodland Regional High School. Stepputtis allowed just four hits while striking out five and walking three. Freshman Coby Dagata took the loss for St. Paul.</p>

<p>After a scoreless first inning, Woodland scored five in the bottom of the second to take a commanding lead. With out out, Max Martin walked and stole second. Brett Lato's RBI single scored Martin and made it 1-0. A walk to Jack Schwenger and an infield single by Jason Beaudry loaded the bases for Tyler DeCrescenzo. DeCrescenzo then drove a 2-0 pitch over the right center field fence for a grand slam and a 5-0 lead.</p>

<p>Woodland tacked on another run in the fifth when DeCrescenzo led off with a single, stole second, and scored on Bill Untiet's RBI single. In the 6th, Lato beat out an infield hit and took second on an errant throw. Lato scored on Beaudry's RBI single, and that made it 7-0, the final score.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
