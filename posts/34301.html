<p>Here we go again. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the fourth time in just over a year, Bristol has been the setting of racist and antisemitic activity. One could ask, why does this seem to be on the increase?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could it be because the city's response is too tepid, something that has been raised by local activists for months and the Democratic party in a press conference just last month on Aug. 21.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mayor and city council have gamely stuck to their pronouncements against hate. Clearly, something more needs to be done. The vandalism of a street sign or use of an obscenity may have at one time been considered a prank and forgiven. Today, we know better. This behavior is a symptom of a bigger problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things are trending in the wrong direction, and we do not want to see them get worse before they get better. Taking a stance is sometimes as simple as calling out something for what it is, specifically, calling racism, racism, white supremacy, white supremacy and antisemitism, antisemitism. </p>

<p>Speaking in generalities is not only poor communication. It is poor leadership.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
