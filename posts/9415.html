<p>The City of Bristol’s Department of Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Service’s (BPRYCS) Fall 2021 Men’s Softball Leagues recently concluded. Despite an unnaturally rainy autumn, both the Men’s 18+ and 40-And-Over leagues were able to complete a full season, including playoffs, to determine the league champions.<br>BPRYCS Softball League Director, Shawn Mirmina, reported that the Men's 18+ Softball League saw a new champion crowned for the first time in three seasons, as Team Davis defeated previous league champions Sporty's Cafe in the finals.<br></p>
