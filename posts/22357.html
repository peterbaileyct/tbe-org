<p>BRISTOL - After a tough loss to Wethersfield on Tuesday evening, it was time for a little revenge for the girls basketball team at Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the unfortunate victim was the squad from Maloney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers thrashed the Spartans for most of the night and in the end, the Kingstreeters rolled up a 55-22 win from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium in Bristol on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CCC South encounter saw Eastern move to 7-8 overall while spoiling Maloney’s .500 ledger (6-7).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And once again, against an opponent from Meriden, Lancers’ senior standout Taigan Parent dropped in several buckets from extreme range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Parent jammed in a game-high 19 points, hitting five three-pointers along the way, as the locals won big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Freshman Autumn Udoh added 12 points, right around her season average, while Vanessa Drury canned 10 for Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury drained two 3s for Eastern as well, Amanda Noel contributed two buckets for four points and Lauren Ayotte also chimed in with four to complete the scoring for the home squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skyler Burke flipped in 15 points to lead the visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers started the game with zest, delivering a 14-4 lead after just eight minutes of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, the deficit just ballooned for the Spartans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters outscored Maloney 22-3 in the second stanza and early into the frame, Maloney absorbed a quick 12-0 run - making it a 26-4 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The halftime edge for Eastern reached 36-7 and Maloney never got into the flow offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers etched up a 44-12 cushion through three completed frames and cruised to the 33-point victory.</p>
