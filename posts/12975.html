<p>SOUTHINGTON - The Bristol Eastern softball team ran up against Southington on Friday afternoon, one of the top programs in the state, and dropped a tough 8-0 decision on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights (12-0) kept their ledger perfect while the Lancers battled but fell for the third straight time (5-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington roped up just six hits but five went for extra bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the home squad did a tremendous job offensively, scoring on all three of the base-on-balls Eastern pitcher Ali Tellier allowed, along with bunts and two sacrifice flies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They scored runs, they hit the ball, they laid the bunts down, they executed their suicide squeeze, and they stole bases,” said Eastern coach Tyler Catlin of Southington. “We made a couple little mistakes that, I think, if we tightened up, it would have been a closer game. But they flat-out won the game.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier never gave in, retiring seven batters in the middle of the game, but the Knights seemingly made every at-bat count.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dominique Gaudio led the Knights with two hits, including a double, while Eastern’s Sam Policki generated the only hit of the contest for the Lancers - beating out an infield single.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington pitching, between Sam Sullivan and Stella Blanchard, managed to tally 16 strikeouts and limited Eastern to just three baserunners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It seemed like one number pitcher after another” for Southington said Catlin. “They pitched [Sullivan] for five innings for [Blanchard] for two innings."&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Brown and Janessa Gonzalez each drew walks for Eastern but weren’t able to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone in the first, Policki put up a heck of a battle against Sullivan but drew strike three as the Knights eventually retired the side in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the tilt, Ashlyn Desaulniers walked and stole second on the first pitch to Elyse Picard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier buckled down to strikeout Elyse Picard but Desaulniers swiped third and scored on Sam Sullivan’s RBI double - just hitting the yellow portion of the centerfield fence - to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sullivan advanced to third on a Samantha Rogers groundout and came home on Dominique Gaudio’s flare to right - making it a 2-0 contest through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sullivan was pushed to two full counts on Gonzalez and Ashley Serafin but the Knights’ chucker struck out the side in the second stanza as the home team maintained its 2-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nicole Szuba started the bottom of the second with a deep triple to left and then Grace Browne made a great grab of a liner off the bat of Kaitlynn Griffin - nearly doubling up Szuba at third base as she dove back to the bag but was just a second too late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Szuba ended up scoring on a suicide squeeze Taylor Sullivan as Browne did not have a play on any runner as Southington etched up a 3-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were set down in order in the third as Sullivan went nine up and nine down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Picard opened the third with a three-base hit and scored on a passed ball, making it a 4-0 game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Sullivan got plunked by a pitch to get on and pinch runner Madelyn Napierski stole second, went to third when the ball got away from the fielder, and scored on a sac fly by Rogers - propelling the Knights to a 5-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alex Shorette and Emily Valentine both made putouts in center and right field, respectively, to end the frame and to open the fourth, the Lancers nearly put a scoring drive together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Brown walked to break Sullivan’s perfect game while Policki smacked a ball that bounced off the pitcher to the second basemen - arriving to first safely for the squad’s only hit of the showdown.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one gone, Gonzalez walked to load the bases as Sullivan was jammed up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Southington pitcher struck out the final two batters of the fourth as the Knights maintained its 5-0 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had that inning where we loaded the bases with one out,” said Catlin of the fourth. “We had an opportunity to put up a couple runs. I was really hoping for the morale of the team that we could have gotten a few across there, especially leading up to the Bristol Central game [Friday].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier and Eastern then had a 1-2-3 fourth inning as Eastern got to the dish quickly in the fifth.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sullivan buckled down again , fanning two in the fifth to keep the Lancers off the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tellier and the defense had retired seven straight before Rogers drilled a solo home run over the fence in center as Southington secured a 6-0 cushion through five.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blanchard relieved Sullivan in the circle in the top of the sixth, striking out the side, as Southington added a couple more runs to its till.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With runners on second and third, Kaitlynn Griffin unleashed a sacrifice fly to center, scoring a run, and when the ball got away, Southington scored again and going into the seventh, Eastern trailed 8-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers went down in order to end the seventh as Southington etched up an 8-0 win to remain perfect throughout 12 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is one of the best teams in the state,” said Catlin of Southington. “[But] I keep telling our team ‘don’t get down because we’re a dangerous team and when we get to the state tournament, nobody’s going to want to face you.’ We’re having a little bit of a lull right now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[But] we’re going to turn the corner soon.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, Eastern and Bristol Central tangle for the first time this season at 3:45 p.m. from the softball field at BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>In the top of the fourth frame, with two on for Eastern, the game was stopped for the National Anthem which was played to begin the Simsbury/Southington boys lacrosse game across the field…The Eastern fans enjoyed every foul ball that landed in traffic on the first base side of the field - probably hoping for a broken window or a dented hood (or two).That same group would have been extremely happy if a ball had plunked off one of the many port a potties around the area, surprising the occupant inside - using the toilet with the blue liquid…</p>
