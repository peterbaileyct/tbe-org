<p>VERNON - The Bristol Eastern softball team ran into a buzzsaw in the form of Rockville High School during second round Class L play on Wednesday, falling by a 7-0 final on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The twenty-second ranked Lancers had a very good season (12-10) but just ran into an elite pitcher in Alexis Real who one-hit the locals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real struck out 14, allowed just one hit while her two base-on-balls did not lead to any additional offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rockville (19-5), the sixth ranked squad in the bracket, ended up getting mercy ruled by No. 3 Law by a 12-0 final in five innings on Friday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Rockville, Eastern All-Stater Emily Valentine smacked out a first inning hit to get something brewing right off the bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also stole a base to lead the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, nothing came of it and Real kept things real until the very end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grace Browne and Isabella Arborio both drew base-on-balls for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ashley Serafin hung in over her final pitching performance, allowing Kourtney Anderson an RBI tally over first inning play as the Lancers trailed 1-0 through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eastern defense held the fort into the fourth frame as it still was just a one run affair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rockville attacked for three runs in the fourth frame and then added three more in the sixth to make it a 7-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Serafin allowed 11 hits but just one earned run over her final game in an Eastern uniform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also tallied four strikeouts and allowed only three walks in her complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Seniors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had three outstanding seniors complete their scholastic careers over the second-round loss in Vernon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazmyn Browne, Sarah Lacouture and Serafin all played their final contest in a Lancers’ uniform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That trio has been absolutely sensational over the last two seasons at Eastern, helping the program to four state tournament victories and were excellent leaders, mentors and teammates for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks in part to that three-pack of seniors, the squad is in a very good position in 2024 having learned from that outstanding senior class at BE.</p>
