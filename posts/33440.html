<p>This week, scholastic sports in town get into full gear and several different programs will be challenged right off the bat during the opening week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central Connecticut Conference has several possible championship-level programs and the teams from Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern should be pushed from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s just a brief rundown of some of the CCC battles our teams will be dealing with after the holiday break:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Football</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>*</strong>Bristol Central at Windsor (Friday, 7 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Eastern vs. Farmington (Friday, 6 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Fact</strong>: The Rams and Lancers are a combined 8-22 against their respective opponents all-time. Along those lines, Central has a losing record against Farmington as does Eastern against Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors will challenge the Rams while the Lancers have a great shot against the River Hawks from Alumni Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boys Soccer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Central at Avon (Thursday, 3:45 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Eastern at Plainville (Friday, 3:45 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Fact</strong>: The Lancers (6-8-3 in 2022) actually get to open their campaign against a CCC South competitor in the form of the double-tough Blue Devils (6-9-1 regular season) while the Rams (6-9-2) will have their hands full against the Falcons (8-5-3) on the road.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Girls Soccer</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Central vs. Windsor (Friday, 3:45 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Eastern at Bloomfield (Thursday, 3:45 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Fact</strong>: Central, the defending CCC South champs, look to start the season with zest against Windsor - a team that went .500 in 2022 (6-6-5). The Lancers and the Warhawks combined to win four total matches last season and Eastern can equal its win total from 2022 with a victory on the road on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Volleyball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Central vs. Simsbury (Thursday, 6:30 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Bristol Eastern at South Windsor (Thursday, 5 p.m.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Interesting Fact:&nbsp;</strong>What an opener for the Class L runners-up from 2022. South Windsor (17-2 regular season in 2022) invades the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium for a huge opening night affair. The Rams are the defending CCC South Champions (7-0 CCC South, 14-6 regular season). On the flip side, the Lancers (13-9) battle a Bobcats’ program that hovered around .500 last season. Both programs have the ability to start the season at 1-0.</p>

<p><strong>On the Horizon</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, Central and Eastern’s combined swim team squares off against Rocky Hill on Tuesday, September 12 from the Dennis Malone Aquatic Center in Bristol at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on the cross country front, the boys and girls programs at Bristol Central travels to Hubbard Park on September 12 - squaring off against Platt and Plainville in a CCC South challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m.</p>
