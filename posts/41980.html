<p>The Friends of the Bristol Public Library will hold the final day of its annual Winter Used Book Sale today with a "fill-the-bag" sale in the meeting rooms in the lower level of the Bristol Library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sale began with 8,000 gently used hardcover and softcover books, DVDs, audio books, CDs and records Wednesday. Books have been priced from $.25 to $2, but today all books, except for specially priced ones, will be sold for $5 per brown bag and $3 for plastic bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today's sale is from 1 to 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Winter Used Book Sale is the Friendsâ€™ primary fundraising event, and the proceeds help provide the Bristol libraries with items and services not included in the annual budget, such as summer reading programs for adults, teens and children, museum passes, and Friends-sponsored special programs. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of the items in the sale were donated by community members, and the Friends appreciate the generosity that makes this fundraiser possible.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
