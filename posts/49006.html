<p>Hope, good neighbors and family were among the themes speakers turned to at the grand opening and ribbon cutting of the new Wheeler Health headquarters at One Hope Street Tuesday afternoon where over 100 people gathered for the celebration and afterwards toured the building and sampled catered treats from local eateries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The facility’s new address, One Hope Street, was alluded to by numerous speakers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout her introductory comments, president and CEO of Wheeler Health Sabrina Trocchi stressed that everyone involved brought “Hope for a better tomorrow” and, after acknowledging all those invested in the process, concluded with an invitation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I want to end where I started," Trocchi said. "Hope, please join me in having hope for a better tomorrow." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her comments, Trocchi thanked, among others, Barnes Group's chairman emeritus Thomas O. Barnes and the Barnes Group Foundation for its critical, initial and, at the time, confidential pledge of $100,000. </p>

<p>In addition, there were words of praise for the volunteer board of trustees for their contributions, the estate of Hall "Cap" Adams, Jr., the family of Ray Corsini, Voya Financial, the anonymous donors behind a gift in memory of former Wheeler executive director David Berkowitz and the Bradley Henry Barnes and Leila Upson Barnes Memorial Trust at the Main Street Community Foundation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from contributors and benefactors, Trocchi thanked all of the people involved in bringing Wheeler to One Hope Street including previous and current board members, the administrative staff of the City of Bristol, Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano and the city council and those involved in the actual design and construction of the new facility along with partners such the Bristol Police Dept. and the West End Association.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Hospital president and CEO Kurt Barwis welcomed Wheeler to the “neighborhood.” He compared Wheeler arriving on Hope Street to having a new neighbor build on the empty lot next to your house. </p>

<p>“You hope that your neighbor is a good neighbor, ... that they build a really nice house, and that they take good care of their house,” said Barwis as he made the point that Wheeler Health was the perfect neighbor for Bristol Health in Centre Square. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barwis concluded by saying that together the two organizations can work “to help all individuals that we serve achieve the highest health status, so that is everybody, not just some people, it’s everybody in our community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barnes, who was mentioned in Trocchi's opening comments, spoke of the history of the Barnes family and its role in helping so many institutions in Bristol. He said that Wheeler Health, Bristol Health and other Bristol organizations were also families and aided and gave hope to so many people in the city of Bristol “family.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the families he mentioned was that of former mayor Ellen Zoppo-Sassu, whose administration fostered and provided the foundation for Wheeler landing its headquarters in Bristol, and current Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano, whose administration overcame disagreements about the project before rallying behind Wheeler.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caggiano spoke of the cooperation of Wheeler in getting the project done in spite of some political roadblocks that could have ended the project before construction began. He also stressed the importance of Wheeler being able to help the people of the area who are facing mental health issues.</p>
