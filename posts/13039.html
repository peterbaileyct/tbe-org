<p>BIDDEFORD, Maine –&nbsp;The Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC) announced its 2022 Softball All-Conference Teams and major award winners this past Tuesday and former Bristol Eastern standout Taylor Keegan was on that award winning list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The utility player from Western New England College was named to the All-CCC First Team due to her stellar play defensively as well as her numbers from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All ten CCC softball schools had at least one representative on this year’s list with CCC Regular-Season Champion Endicott leading the way with eight selections.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan, the 5-foot-3 Sport Management major, had a busy sophomore campaign for WNE as the team is on the cusp of a 30-win campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan helped the Golden Bears to a 27-13 ledger to date this season as the team continues its postseason push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She displayed her usual grit to open CCC Tournament play as WNE ramped up a 1-0 triumph over Nicolas College this past Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan collected a single, drew a walk, and stole two bases to help lead the offensive charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In second round play versus the University of New England the following day, WNE dropped the squad by a 9-0 final as Keegan again produced from the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She scooped up a hit, earned another base-on-balls, and scored two runs as the Golden Bears won big.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan played in 37 of the program’s first 40 games and the infielder had a tremendous campaign overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tallied 41 hits, including nine doubles and a triple, to go along with eight RBI and 13 base-on-balls (second on the squad).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She stole a team-leading 12 bases, carries a tremendous .409 on base percentage while slugging the ball at a .441 clip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan nabbed 12 multi-hit games and collected three hits this season against St. Norbert (March 17) and went 3-for-3 in an 8-0 shutout at Curry on April 30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a freshman for the Golden Bears, Keegan appeared in 15 games – batting a healthy .286 which included eight hits and five RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keegan was a CCC South All-Conference performer in both 2018 and 2019 and was a mainstay in the line-up for then Bristol Eastern coach Scott Redman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voting for the All-CCC Teams and major awards was conducted by the 10 CCC softball head coaches following the conclusion of regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the complete listing of the first team from the CCC.</p>
