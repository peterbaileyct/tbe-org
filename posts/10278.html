<p>There is no doubt that our current mayor regrets ever being elected to run the city. All you have to do is see his social media posts where he clearly wants sympathy for starting his job at “7 a.m. and not being home until 8 p.m. since inauguration” and you can tell the level of regret. It’s palpable. Add to that his further consternation that he’s doing all of this for a “huge pay cut” and it becomes quite clear he hates this job. Mayor, what exactly were you expecting? Did you think this was just a bunch of photo ops and then just phone in the rest? What’s even more hilarious is now you want everyone to “be kind” in 2022 and stop claiming that you’re “only working part-time.” </p>

<p>That’s some nerve.&nbsp;You and your cronies ran a campaign that took cheap shot after cheap shot at the previous mayor and her administration.&nbsp;Throughout, you used old issues, told half-truths, used national issues with little or no bearing on Bristol and appealed to a segment of the electorate who thinks the sexual politics of the 1950’s were America’s heyday.&nbsp;As evidenced by your inaugural location.&nbsp;It worked.&nbsp;They voted and others didn’t.&nbsp;Surprise, you’re mayor.</p>

<p>“Be kind.” Is that code for the residents of Bristol to lower their expectations of you and don’t expect the same level of commitment as was provided by your predecessor?&nbsp;This isn’t an issue of being “kind.”&nbsp;It’s an issue of doing the job you were elected to do.&nbsp;No one cares how much less money you make or how many more hours you work.&nbsp;To the thousands of Bristol residents who make far less than your “pay cut” salary of $100k and work far more hours than your 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., it’s of no consequence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality, winning was never part of the plan. My guess was the real goal was to swing a portion of the city council so as to cause a political ruckus until two years hence when you could either groom another candidate or rerun another from the past. I’m skeptical that giving up that sweet sales job (twice the pay and half the hours) you’ve had for many a year was where this was supposed to end. But just like the charade of a campaign you ran you need to keep the charade of an administration going.</p>

<p>Well, the chickens have come home to roost.&nbsp;Not only is this job not so much fun because of the time commitment and the lower comp, but you have a city council that’s so green and lacking in what it takes to actually operate a city they’re already derailing critical economic growth plans.&nbsp;Your “hand-picked” group did a number on you and the city with their brilliant Wheeler Clinic vote.&nbsp;Now a new debacle with COVID testing and testing kits.&nbsp;Luckily CERT organized distribution because your phoning it in from New Hampshire lacked any and all leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My late mom used say, “If you don’t like the heat, get out of the kitchen.”&nbsp;Well, if the mayor thinks the kitchen is hot now then just wait.&nbsp;The stove is barely on low.&nbsp;Mayor Caggiano, do us all a favor.&nbsp;Either do the job you were elected to do without complaining about the time commitment and lower salary or quit. Maybe you can get your old job back.&nbsp; Either way, stop whining!</p>
