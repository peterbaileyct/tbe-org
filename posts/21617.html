<p>BRISTOL - Since dropping a tough 55-51 decision to Middletown on December 22, the girls basketball program over at Bristol Central is on a hot streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winners of four straight games, the Rams were able to knock off pesky Lewis Mills via a 44-18 final on Friday from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium from the campus of BCHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams are now 6-2 overall after hovering around .500 earlier in the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central hasn’t allowed an opponent more than thirty points over the last four contests - holding the competition to scoring totals of just seven, 30, 19 and 18 points over four straight blowouts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills, falling to 4-4 on the season over the losing effort, hung around during first half play and trailed by just 10 points (21-11).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central outscored the Spartans by that same total over third period play to lead big with eight minutes remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone made a contribution for the Rams that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Leilani Jackson-Mills led all players with 10 points, Arianna Rivera nabbed eight, Nicole Riemer added six while Brooke Watson and defensive guru Kaley Laird each notched five points apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central led 11-4 after eight minutes of work and after outscoring Lewis Mills 10-7 in the second stanza, the home team scooped up a 21-11 edge at intermission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams held the Spartans to just seven total points over the third and fourth quarters as Central earned a hard-fought 24-point win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Over the last two pack of games, opponents have scored a combined 37 points (18.5 points-per-game). At the Bristol Central Holiday Classic, the Rams also allowed just 37 total points over two games…Since that setback against Middletown, Central has averaged 55.5 points-per-game.</p>
