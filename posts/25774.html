<p>St. Paul scored all three of their runs in the top of the third. With one out, Logan Rembish walked and stole second. Jamie Leggett drove in Rembish with an RBI single for the first run of the game. After Leggett stole second, Devin Kulas was hit by a pitch to put two men on. A successful double steal put men on second and third, and Cal Chance drove them both in with a two RBI single.</p>

<p>The Falcons maintained the 3-0 lead until the bottom of the 7th when Holy Cross mounted a rally. After a leadoff walk to Dario Sosa, Dillon Fernandes hit a ball to deep center field that was dropped for a 2 base error. Leggett struck out the next 2 batters to come within 1 out of a shut out. But a wild pitch allowed Sosa to score and Fernandes to advance to third. A walk to Logan Brown followed by a stolen base put the tying run on second. But Leggett bore down to record his thirteenth strikeout and end the game 3-1.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
