<p>Among the issues the city council will be addressing at Thursday's special council meeting is a vote on an ordinance that rejects the sale of recreational cannabis within the city, which if approved may result in a longtime Bristol medical marijuana dispensary leaving the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other items included on the agenda are the formation of a fair rent commission, the creation of a building committee to oversee the new fire station planned for Church Street in Forestville and public participation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Special meetings of the city council have agendas that restrict action at the meeting to the items on the agenda. The special meeting will be held at the Bristol Board of Education auditorium, Thursday evening, beginning at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ordinance committee, comprised of council members Cheryl Thibeault, Susan Tyler (chair) and Jacqueline Olsen, passed a "no retail, no where, no how" version regarding the sale of recreational cannabis, a  position opposed by Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cannabis ordinance, as written, will most likely result in longtime Bristol medical marijuana dispensary Trulieve departing the city, because no dispensary-only can compete with a combined dispensary and retail store, or hybrid. The ordinance, if passed, would take effect in 14 days.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public participation, if previous meetings are an indication, promises to draw commentators on both sides of the issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the items on the consent calendar, there is the creation of a new building committee to oversee the new fire station planned for Forestville, a project that has been pretty much under the radar. Consent calendar items typically do not get much comment and are a rubber stamp by the time they reach a vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creation of a fair rent commission is mandated by a new state law. Cities as large as Bristol are required to have one. This task force will come up with the details of what the Fair Rent Commission will be charged to do.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
