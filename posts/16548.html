<p>He was born in Terryville, Conn., on July 6, 1933, and was one of five children to the late Hubert and Florence (Gaylord) Goodwin. He was always smiling and if you were one of the lucky ones, you’d receive a wink too! In his early days he loved life in the fast lane. He was an avid NASCAR fan, enjoyed attending local fairs to watch the Draft Horse Pull, usually first on site to see the horse teams come in. He enjoyed hitting the slots at the casino with anyone who would join. As a host, empty glasses weren’t allowed. He truly loved to people watch whether from his front porch or through the window at Countryside. </p>

Hinman &amp; Sons, Dunning Sand and Gravel (30+ years), Martin Laviero, and Nelson’s Trucking. He served as a Volunteer Firefighter for the town of Burlington and was a member of the Burlington Men’s Club.</p>
