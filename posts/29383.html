<p>The Bristol Shock, formerly known as the Bristol Knights of the Connecticut Twilight League, have made more than a couple long postseason runs in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And why should things be any different for the veteran club in 2023?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After joining forces with the Southington Aftershock to form the newly minted Bristol Shock, the squad finished the regular season at 8-12 – nine games behind regular season champion Wolcott/Terryville Scrappers (17-3-1) – to earn the sixth seed in the annual CTL postseason fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the sixth ranked Shock were able to stay out of the elimination bracket by spinning up a 9-7 upset victory over the third ranked Rocky Hill Rockies from Riverfront Park in Glastonbury on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That huge win will fuel the Shock into battle against the New Britain Rock Cats on Tuesday at 6 p.m. in a winner’s bracket showdown in Glastonbury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain is the second seeded program in CTL tournament play this season at 13-5-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the late game on Friday, the fifth ranked Elmer’s Angels defeated No. 4 Enfield Patriots by a 7-2 final as a couple of the top programs in the league will attempt to survive life in the elimination bracket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol must lose twice to be eliminated&nbsp;in postseason play</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s double elimination for Bristol, meaning no matter what happens on Tuesday evening, the Shock will live on to play another day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And frankly, just like every year, the winner of this tournament sometimes isn’t the team with the best regular season record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But defending champion Wolcott/Terryville will be a tough outfit to top in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve had years where the dominant top team wins, and years where an underperforming regular season team comes back to run through the playoffs and take the championship,” according to a release on the CTL website. “Who’s it going to be this year? The Scrappers&nbsp;(previously the Black Sox) are our defending champions and finished 2023 in first [place] so everyone’s got them in their sights. Will someone knock them off or will they repeat?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That question will be answered by the completion of the CTL postseason tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tournament to finish up from Muzzy Field</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The CTL finals will once again take place from the friendly confines of Muzzy Field and the Bristol Shock hope to be part of the title picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Games will continue to commence from Riverfront Park until the end of this week, then transition to Muzzy Field in Bristol, starting on Monday, August 14 with an elimination game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be interesting to see where the program from Bristol ends up when the playoffs are complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, in a now ironic twist, Bristol fell to the Southington Aftershock, getting eliminated from the postseason in a showdown from Beehive Field in New Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Aftershock, started by a couple of former Bristol Knights players, joined back with Bristol for the 2023 campaign, playing well along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Knights went 11-9-2 overall in 2022 while the Aftershock was 9-13-1.&nbsp;</p>
