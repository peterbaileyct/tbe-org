<p>MERIDEN - The Bristol Eastern wrestling program traveled to Maloney on Wednesday night, battling an always tough Spartans squad in a CCC South confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers won its second straight match, scooping up a 45-21 victory in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is now 2-1 while Maloney fell to 1-7 on the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans didn’t have much luck against an up-and-coming Lancers’ squad as forfeits and quick pins by the Kingstreeters foiled the home team’s chances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starting at 106 pounds, Eastern sophomore Andrew Brown won via forfeit while freshman Luke Viens (113) also did not have an opponent to square off against.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney’s Onil Carrion (120) pinned Michael Roalf in 3:19 but at 126, Eastern started a bit of a run to take charge of the meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabe White pinned Nicholas Rodriguez just as the time was about to run out in the third period, roping up the victory in 5:52.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then at 132 pounds, Eastern’s Nathan Torres won via pinfall over Robert Taylor in 4:50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joshua Aubin (145) earned three points with his 8-2 decision against Saleem Saleh and then at 160, Eastern’s Alex Marshall didn’t waste any time against Malachi Rivera - taking the pin-fall victory in thirty seconds flat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaiden Dionne (170) was in no mood for tomfoolery either, nabbing the pin in 56 seconds against Adnel Torres.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ditto for Dylan Piazza (182), pinning Maloney’s Alex Macancela in just 41 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even as the Eastern trio of Jaiden Fore (195), Owen Broyles (220), and Evan Gleifert (285) did not earn victories that evening, experience counts in large amounts which will help those heavyweights down the road this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result was a 45-21 victory in Eastern’s favor as the program earned another win, this time on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On the horizon…</strong>The Lancers have a busy Saturday as the program battles Middletown, Plainville, and RHAM in Hebron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The battle commences at 10 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the following Wednesday, Platt invades the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium for a showdown against the Panthers in another CCC South bout.</p>
