<p>BRISTOL – For the first time since the 1989-90 scholastic campaign, the Bristol Central boys basketball team went through the regular season undefeated – going a perfect 20-0.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That matches the Rams finish of 20-0 in 1990 as the BCHS program has the only two undefeated seasons since the city established Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern as separate high schools in 1959.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this year’s program, from top to bottom, was an impressive lot on every level.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m really proud of my kids as a program, freshman through varsity,” said Barrette. “We just finished 50-3 as a program. That’s a pretty great accomplishment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol high school’s last undefeated squad came in 1943-44 which means since the end of World War II, the public high schools in town have enjoyed three undefeated seasons - and Central can claim two of those squads. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That 1989-90 team, headlined by Malcolm Huckaby, Lonnie Brooks, Greg Fradette, and Rod Hickey, helped the Rams average just over 69 points-per-game while allowing just 55.5 points on the flip side.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both the current Central squad and the team that opened the decade of the 1990s managed to play one overtime game on the way to a perfect season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams’ lone non-regulation game against Southington in 1989-90 went into double-overtime as Central won, 59-55.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central went 8-0 that year in games decided by 10 points or less.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Class L champs from 1990 earned the top seed by lot and ended up battling No. 2 St. Joseph over an exciting championship bout.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won the game, 66-65, from Central Connecticut State University in New Britain as Fradette canned the game-winning jump shot with just seconds to play in the contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What will the fate of the current Central squad be in CIAC Division II play?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will BCHS capture its second ever state championship by the completion of postseason play in March?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams of 2021-22, with the likes of Victor Rosa, Steve Alseph, Carson Rivoira, and Damion Glasper leading the charge, had a more dominating regular season – headlined by center Donovan Clingan who, just like Huckaby, is heading to a Big East school after his scholastic days are over.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scores between the two programs differ greatly as the 1990 squad had trouble against Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1990, the Rams won both encounters against the Lancers by seven total points while the Central squad from this season defeated the Kingstreeters by a combined 75 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, in terms of scores, how do the two undefeated squads from Central stack up during regular season play?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without including specific dates, here’s each program’s regular season scores as the games played out:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Points scored-per-game:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 69.2&nbsp;(1990)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73.1 (2022)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Points allowed-per-game:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55.5&nbsp;&nbsp;(1990)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44.4</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(2022)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offensive numbers aren’t far off as the current edition outscored the crew from 1990 by just under four points a game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Central squads were prolific in their scoring exploits but it’s the defense that stands those two programs apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan and crew allowed just 44.4 points-per-game in regular season action – 11.1 points better than the Class L champs from 32 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, the Rams outscored opponents this season by an incredible 574 points.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, both those tallies from Central’s undefeated teams are impressive but having a 7-foot-2 monster in, and around, the paint has certainly proved to be the difference maker between the two teams from BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has played some of the best programs in the state this year and the current squad looks forward to more of the same during postseason play. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think playing at Mohegan Sun and playing Springfield Central up in Massachusetts [has] prepared us,” said Barrette. “Playing Wilbur Cross, you know, we challenged ourselves as much as we could out of the conference as best we could do. We’re excited to have an opportunity to play the best teams in the state and see where we stack up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
