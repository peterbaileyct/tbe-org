<p>Paul was a wonderful father, grandfather, brother, friend and neighbor. He always took such joy in his family. He enjoyed vacationing with them every year in Wells Beach, Maine. He was always proud to attend his grandchildrens’ games, concerts, recitals and other activities. He helped his kids with numerous house projects and was always there to help get ready for a gathering or party. </p>

<p>He was an extremely hard worker always getting the job done. He was a “jack of all trades” and “master of each one.” He worked hard all the way up until the day of his passing. He was always there whenever anyone needed a hand whether it be his kids, grandkids, friends or neighbors.    Every so often he would take a break to enjoy a round of golf. Paul will be missed by so many!</p>
