<p>Mr. C.S. Bailey was cruelly attacked and badly injured last Thursday at the shop of J.H. Sessions by a shopmate named Circular Saw. The two have worked together at the same bench for many years. Three or four times before Mr. Bailey has been attacked by the hard-hearted villain in a similar way. In those frays he lost the greater part of two fingers on his left hand and a thumb. This time another finger has been cut off, the remaining one nearly severed and the stumps badly mangled.</p>
