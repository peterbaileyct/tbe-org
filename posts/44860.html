<p>St. Paul scored its sole run in the top of the fourth inning. Catcher Cal Chance led off with a walk, and advanced to second on a wild pitch. He went to third on Coby Dagata's ground out, and scored on AJ Corrado's sacrifice fly to deep center.</p>

<p>Holy Cross scored one in the bottom of the sixth to tie the score. James LaFleur and Eli Wall had back-to-back walks to start the inning. Then Drew Caouette had a bunt single to load the bases with no outs. Dagata struck out the next batter for the first out, but then Ryan Markowski walked forcing in a run. Dagata got the next two hitters to end the threat, but the game was tied 1-1.Â </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
