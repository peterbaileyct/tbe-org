<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come Sunday morning, there will be the fallout from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Nothing good comes from an action like this, especially in a country that prides itself on being a democracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, a former president with a flesh wound that might have been much worse, if for a few inches; one person in the audience, dead; two people in the audience injured, one critically; and a 20-year-old, the suspected shooter, using an AR-15-type rifle, dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What this might indicate is stepping back rather than stepping closer into the incident is required--attempting to get a broader picture, perhaps. As it happens, however, the mudslinging has already begun on social media and calls for reflection are being drowned out. And so it goes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For listening, something that is appropriate for this particular moment in time might be "Out of the Rabbit Hole," the latest episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. The show notes state that this podcast "takes a deep dive into the motivations of people on the brink of extremism--and those who have already been radicalized."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The notes continue: "We examine what prompts people to turn to violence, and how to pull them back from the seductive appeal of extremist ideas." Click <a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/out-of-the-rabbit-hole/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For reading, remarkably, in these volatile times, is a book, "Cloud Cuckoo Land" by Anthony Doerr, that might just provide some solace. It is simply a magical book, and as all magic, it takes us away from and back to reality, so that, when we return, we are better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book revolves around an ancient manuscript that is incomplete and filling in the blanks is not only words but the stories that ally with the effort to complete the translation: in the lives of such characters as a time traveling teen from the future; a disaffected teen from the 2000s; a couple of young people from different sides at the battle for Constantinople in the 1400s; and a young man who comes of age in the Korean War. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might also help to know that violence is forever present, as one line from the translation states, "One side is dancing, the other side is death" and as another line states, "The world as it is is enough."</p>

<p>I can’t say it enough, it doesn’t take much imagination to see that local newspapers of any quality are few and far between. Here at TBE, working under our nonprofit Central Connecticut Online Journalism Project, we aim to make Bristol a community with a vibrant and engaged local community newspaper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can help. Consider becoming a member by signing up for monthly recurring donations of $6, $12, or $24 or making a one-time donation of $60 or even better donating more.&nbsp;It might seem outrageous, but 5,000 members paying $6 a month would allow us to hire editors and reporters who would do a great job covering Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
