<p><em>Center Street Info</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Center Street was built in 1746.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Aug. 7, 1908, Bristol Police arrested three members of the Center Street Gang. According to the charge, the gang, which had a dozen members, spent the summer making other people miserable, so they were arrested for breach of peace.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have you ever wondered about the history of cemeteries? If so, you are in for a treat because on Saturday, at 1 p.m. at the Bristol Historical Society, Maya Bringe is doing a program about cemetery history and symbolism. The Bristol Historical Society is located at 98 Summer St., and the suggested donation is $5. Or, five smackers or five clams, or if you wish to stay within the theme, five dead presidents. Yeah, that was one too many. Moving on.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
