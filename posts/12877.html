<h1>Copper Ledges  tennis courts about to reopen under new ownership</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A year ago, the Copper Ledges Tennis Association put the clay courts on the corner of Bradley St. and Brewster Rd. up for sale. The tennis group had owned the courts since the early 1970’s and the clay courts were always considered two of the best in Bristol and were used for years as the site of city tennis championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As time has passed, Copper Ledges’ membership roll decreased from 100 members plus a waiting list to a current roll of less than fifteen members. The small membership group could not afford to keep up with the costs of maintaining the facility, and decided to try to sell it in the spring of 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things looked bleak for the future of the courts as last year they sat unused and rapidly deteriorating. Then a ”miracle” occurred. A buyer emerged who wanted to save the courts. He agreed to buy the courts and keep them as a tennis facility. The Copper Ledges Tennis Association agreed to use the proceeds from the sale to fix up the courts and the members were given the right to continue to use the courts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see from the photos below, the courts have been transformed to their former glory. If you are interested in joining the Copper Ledges tennis club, contact Al Gutewicz at Algutowicz@att.net for details on how to join.</p>
