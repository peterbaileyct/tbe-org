<p>As autumn blankets Bristol’s yards, homeowners face the annual chore of dealing with fallen leaves. Unlike some neighboring towns that offer curbside leaf vacuuming, Bristol residents turn to a variety of options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol residents might rake and bag their leaves, they might mulch them or simply leave leaves where they fall. (Of course, there is an option to hire a landscaper to deal with them.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Raking and bagging</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bagging leaves is a common method in Bristol as one can see from streets across town lined with rows of large, leaf-filled paper bags. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an unseasonably warm fall afternoon, local resident Melissa (she asked to use her first name only) reflected on her progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m up to 60 bags; I usually fill about 100 bags a year,” she said with a smile. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city had just picked up her 60 bags earlier that morning, and she was already filling a new row of bags using her handy leaf scoops. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though Melissa is dedicated to bagging the leaves herself, she admitted the task can become overwhelming and is beginning to take a toll on her body after 40 years of annual leaf cleanup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s expensive to hire someone to do it professionally, and even then, the leaves keep falling the next day,” she said. “I miss the old days when they vacuumed them right at the curb. I wish they'd bring that back. Or, like when the bagging program started, they used to give out free bags.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comparing the expense of leaf bags versus paying a landscaper, Melissa is weighing whether to stick with bagging or hire a landscaping company with a leaf vacuum next year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tim Lancaster was helping a friend blow leaves into piles in preparation for bagging. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I plan to blow them into piles and bag them up, but for larger projects, I’ve paid for a vacuum service,” he said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While he acknowledged the cost, Tim said he believes that for particularly big leaf removal projects, the convenience of a vacuum service makes it worthwhile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You still have to rake or blow them to the curb, but it saves a lot of time and energy,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tim, like Melissa, echoed the sentiment about the convenience of curbside leaf vacuuming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wish Bristol had a leaf vacuum service. It would make things a lot easier,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city’s Public Works Department provides seasonal leaf collection, picking up bagged leaves from residents mid-October through the beginning of December.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Josh Corey, the solid waste supervisor for Bristol Public Works, "The city will collect bagged leaves and the green yard waste bins until Dec. 6. So as long as you put it at the curb by Dec. 6, the city we’ll pick them up. After then, residents can bring yard waste to the transfer stations themselves with no charge, but they need a permit you can get at city hall."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For details on pickup schedules, residents can consult the city’s website, which also reminds everyone to use paper bags for leaf collection and remove leaves blocking catch basins to reduce flooding.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What happens to the leaf bags?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":53750,"width":"398px","height":"auto","align":"left"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignleft is-resized"><img src="https://www.bristoledition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pile-of-bags-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-53750" style="width:398px;height:auto"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Leaf bags appear along city streets waiting for Public Works to collect them. | JoAnn Moran</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once collected, the city’s leaf bags end up at the Bristol Transfer Station, where they are piled along with other yard waste, including grass clippings, branches, and eventually Christmas trees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each year, a massive pile of leaves forms within the station’s grounds. This mound is later mulched into rich compost soil, which is then used for landscaping in Bristol’s parks and public properties. It’s also made available for residents to pick up free of charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"placeholder":"Content…"} -->
<p>For those looking to fertilize their gardens or yards, Bristol offers a free service throughout the year. The compost soil from the mulched leaves is stored in a pit located on Vincent P. Kelly Road, next to the Dog Pound. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residents can fill up buckets with this dark, nutrient-rich soil to fertilize lawns, gardens, or flower beds. There are also piles of sand available for free, which can be useful for winterizing properties.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mulching</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mulching leaves instead of raking can be a great way to benefit your lawn. When mowed into lawns, leaves mix with grass clippings to create compost, and research has shown many benefits. Mulched leaves provide essential nutrients to lawns, help lawns retain moisture, and prevent weeds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Mike Carlson of Bristol, mulching leaves is more than just a seasonal chore—it’s part of a sustainable routine that he enjoys. With the help of a few specialized tools, he has turned the task of leaf mulching into an efficient and eco-friendly process. Instead of dreading the arrival of fallen leaves, Mike looks forward to it with anticipation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I actually get excited when the leaves start to fall. It’s a chance to refresh my lawn and gardens with all those nutrients,” Mike said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, he’s developed a technique that works for his property, relying on a mower equipped with a mulching blade set to its highest setting. This allows him to chop up the leaves finely enough that they can easily mix with grass clippings and break down quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to mulching his own leaves, Mike also takes advantage of extra leaves from his neighbors and a bag or two from the roadside. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve gotten really good at spotting the bags on the curb, especially if I see a lot of maple leaves,” Mike said. “Maples are ideal for mulching because they break down quickly and add excellent organic matter to the lawn.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He often snatches the bags before they’re picked up by the city, adding them to his mulch collection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I mulch all my leaves and spread them over my garden or use them to fill depressions in my lawn,” he continued. “I’ve been mulching for years, and it’s made a huge difference. I don’t need to worry about disposing of them, and my lawn looks better every year.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To mulch leaves, you can use a mower with a mulching blade set to its highest setting. You might need to mow in a crisscross pattern for deep layers of leaves. You can also alternate between mulching and bagging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should avoid mulching eucalyptus or black walnut leaves, as they can damage other plants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The last choice -- leave your leaves</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than the tedious task of raking and bagging, consider leaving the leaves! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leaving leaves can be an effective way to contribute to a healthier ecosystem and lawn while supporting local wildlife. Environmental advocates encourage homeowners to embrace an eco-friendlier approach to yard care. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If it’s bare, leave them there—especially around shrubs or in wooded areas,” said Mary Rydingsward of the Pequabuck River Watershed Association. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This small act of conservation can make a big difference for native pollinators, birds, and other backyard wildlife. Many animals, including toads, frogs and certain moths and butterflies, have adapted to hibernate in the natural insulating layer of leaf litter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“By allowing some leaves to remain, we can create healthier, more sustainable spaces for our local wildlife,” says ecologist Dr. Sarah Jennings, who works with The Nature Conservancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By allowing leaves to remain, landowners can eliminate the need for products like "Scotts Step 4," saving money while reducing the amount of fertilizers that reach our waterways and improve Bristol’s ecosystems.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture agrees. In an article titled <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2022/10/17/fall-leave-leaves#:~:text=The%20more%20leaves%20left%20on,to%20use%20on%20your%20crops."><u>“This Fall, Leave the Leaves”</u></a> the department advises:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Leaves create a natural mulch that helps to suppress weeds while fertilizing the soil as it breaks down. The leaves also serve as a habitat for wildlife including lizards, birds, turtles, frogs, and insects that overwinter in the fallen leaves. These living creatures help keep pests down and increase pollination in your garden,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Micro-organisms are the life of soil, and they need food and nutrients all the time. The more leaves left, the more feed for these micro-organisms that make soil healthier and plants grow stronger. As the leaves decay, they add organic matter back into the soil, which lessens the need for fertilizer."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Balancing aesthetics with ecology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If leaving some leaves seems messy or unappealing, you can always find a balance between keeping your yard neat and benefiting from the ecological advantages. By leaving some leaves in select areas, you can still enhance soil health, help local wildlife, and preserve the aesthetics of your property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>f you're concerned about curb appeal, consider leaving leaves in parts of your yard where they are less noticeable. Designate “leaf zones” such as inside yards, under shrubs, garden beds or around trees. This allows you to maintain a tidy front yard while still giving back to the environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"While it's beneficial to leave some leaf litter for wildlife and soil health, it's also important to follow local fire safety guidelines. During fire season, homeowners should avoid leaving large amounts of leaves or other combustible materials near structures. Instead, designate areas away from the home for leaf litter, ensuring that the front yard and defensible space remain clear." — <em>California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)</em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rake, mulch or leave your leaves?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you rake and bag, mow and mulch or simply let your leaves decompose naturally, each approach benefits both the community and the environment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By composting fallen leaves, you’re helping to create nutrient-rich soil that can be used year-round. Last year’s leaves can be transformed into fresh compost, which helps enrich our parks, gardens, and yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, whether you're tackling the leaf pile with a rake, blower, or mower, or hiring a landscaper or vacuum service, there’s a solution that works for every homeowner. Each method contributes to a healthier, more sustainable environment for all.</p>
