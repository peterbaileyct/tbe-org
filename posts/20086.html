<p>EAST HAVEN - The Bristol Central volleyball team left it all on the court on Saturday afternoon at the Class L championship showdown against top seeded Joel Barlow - battling to the final point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Falcons will probably finish as the No. 1 ranked program in the state as the squad nabbed a 3-0 win over No. 7 Central for the title from East Haven High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set scores were 25-13, 25-20 and 25-23 as Barlow went a perfect 24-0 this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams, a tremendous seventh seeded program, battled all the way to the championship tilt over a loaded Class L field this season and did not disappoint.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But every time Central (19-8) put a big swing on the ball, the Falcons seemingly found a way to send it back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s a reason why they’re the number one team in our division,” said Central coach Lance Pepper. “They never give up. They’re scrappy. They run a fast-tempo offense we haven’t seen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barlow’s Emmy Asplund earned tournament MVP honors as the setter scooped up seven kills, dished out 34 assists and bumped up 13 digs over a tremendous effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She orchestrated an offense that got plenty of swings from both the left side and middle of the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central never quit, holding late edges in both the second and third sets as 12 lead changes and 16 ties marked a tremendous back-and-forth showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s been our story of our season,” Pepper said. “The fact that these kids come in, and they work their tails off, day-in and day-out. They never give up. They were down 19-13 [in the third set] and all of a sudden, it was 19-19. It’s just incredible.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit senior libero Sam Sklenka, ending her final scholastic game with 17 digs, had the tough task of bumping up those loud swings from the Barlow side and more than held her own.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central started the first set with zest as setter Alex Rivera (24 assists) added an early ace, Brooke Valentino (four kills, 12 digs) had a slick backline kill and off a loud swing by Maddie Lodovico (seven kills, 11 digs) - combined with a miscue from Barlow - it was a 5-2 game as the Rams got off to a hot start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the top program in Class L then posted a 15-6 run as Kat Czerkawski (12 kills) dropped in three consecutive swings as Barlow zipped up an 17-11 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re dynamic at all hitters,” said Pepper of Barlow. “Their setter did a phenomenal job. It’s just a good team. It [just] stinks we had to play them now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Olivia Clingan (eight kills, two blocks) swing chopped the deficit to 17-12 but the Falcons notched eight of the final nine points to snare a 25-13 win for the set one victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In set two, the Rams had another fast start as Central led 5-3 and when Valentino slipped in a serve that was not returned, the squad was in charge by a single point (7-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was up and down from there as Barlow grabbed an 18-14 edge and attempted to close things out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Rivera fed Grace Higgins nicely for a kill on the right side and then the sophomore did some damage at the service line - leading to a slick 5-0 burst - as Central went ahead 19-18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Her serve-receive for us tonight was phenomenal,” said Pepper of Higgins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It went to 20-20 and it was still anyone’s set but Barlow closed out the period on a 5-1 jaunt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An ace by Libby Grob closed things out as the top seed won 25-20 - going ahead 2-0 in the match.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Midway through the third and final frame, Barlow held a slim 8-7 lead but off the power of a mini 4-0 run - ended by another Grob serve that was not returned - the Falcons were in charge at 12-7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trailing 19-13, Central made one final run in an attempt to steal the set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Lily Kirk (eight kills, three aces) suddenly started dropping down bombs from the service line, Barlow quickly had serve-receive issues and by the time the freshman was finished serving, Central nabbed a 20-19 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think Lily really found her way in the playoffs,” said Pepper of Kirk. “That experience you can never take away from these kids."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barlow reigned the lead a couple points later but off a little 3-0 Central burst - highlighted by a long Clingan kill - the Rams nabbed a 23-21 edge, and the Falcons were forced to call time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Barlow collected the final four points of the match and when Ashland landed the final swing of the day, Barlow scooped up a 25-23 set three win and took the Class L Championship 3-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give Central credit because Barlow wasn’t able to run away with the match as the Rams fought, scratched and clawed to the very end - seizing a program record 19 wins and earning the runner-up trophy in the process - the first ever in the history of the Rams’ program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They just worked their tails off,” said Pepper of his squad. “And that’s all I could have ever asked from any of these kids.”</p>
