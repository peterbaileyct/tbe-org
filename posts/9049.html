<p>The Republicans also had the top three vote totals for the Board of Education. Eric Carlson (7,081) was followed by Dante Tagariello (6,726) and Todd Sturgeon (6,523). No Democrat attained 6,000 votes, but Democrat Chris Wilson, with 5,809 votes will retain his seat over Sturgeon due to minority party representation requirements.</p>

<p>Bristol voters also rejected two of the three Charter questions. The Treasurer position will remain a two-year elected one, and the Registrar of Voters positions will remain two-year terms after changes endorsed by both parties were overwhelmingly rejected.</p>
