<p>Berlin pressed the attack throughout the first half as their use of the wide Sage Park field and their quick feet had the Lancers on their heels.   However, center backs Landon Gawel and Sam LaMar were able to frustrate many attacks in the final third and Lancer goalie Connor Murtaugh came through with some timely saves (5).</p>

<p>“Berlin played the best of any team we've seen this year," said Lancer coach Bill Sweet.  "Their use of the wide field and quick passes kept us busy all night.   However, after the first score, the game opened up and we had chances."</p>

<p>After a scoreless first half, Berlin scored the first goal at 33:46 when Marcus Joshi hit a hard rising shot into the Lancer goal from 20 yards out.   </p>

<p>Eastern came back and a Matt Cabrera shot just went wide of the goal. Then at 28:53, Murtaugh knocked a Tommy Francalangia shot wide. Francalangia got to the rebound and knocked the shot in for the second goal.</p>

<p>The Lancers had their chances soon after, as a Nate Ash shot and a Hunter Scott shot were both just cleared by Berlin defenders in front of the goal.   Eastern's best chance came with 15 minutes to go. A Lucas Tylicky corner kick hit inside the Redcoat goal. It dropped straight down, but not over the goal line.</p>
