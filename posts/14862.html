<p>BRISTOL - After four innings of play against Zone 1 leader West Hartford on Tuesday afternoon, Bristol was in it to win it - trailing just 3-2 going into the fifth frame of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the bottom dropped out on Post 2 as the locals ran out of pitching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96 scored nine times in the top of the fifth - eventually snaring a 12-2 victory in five innings of action from Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford (15-0) remains undefeated in Zone 1 play while Bristol fell to 9-6 with one game to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol turned to Alex Canzellarini on the hill and the chucker did a credible job, going four full innings - allowing just four runs on four hits to keep Post 2 in the mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He did well other than the walks and hit batters,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Canzellarini. “I think he hit four guys and walked five or six. He only gave up three hits until that last inning. It’s just a matter of command with him.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Maybe that will give him a little confidence. If we make a run in the playoffs, we’re going to need his arm.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Canzellarini hit and walked a combination of nine batters, only two came around to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all of that took place over first inning play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Dooley was beaned by a Canzellarini ball and Tommy LaSpada walked with two away in the first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drew Seidman then dropped a bloop single into right to score Dooley as Post 96 etched up a 1-0 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase Hanawalt was also plunked by a ball to load up the bases and Ixael Albino forced in a run home via walk (2-0).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Brian Chelli flew out to left to end the half-frame as West Hartford was ahead on the scoreboard, 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayden Churchill (1-for-3) continued his hot streak at the dish with a single that was poked by third base with one out in the first.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later stole second but ended the inning stranded at the base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the second, West Hartford pitcher Lucas Pyrro helped his own cause with a single to right but a 6-4-3 double play erased the base runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Elliot Norris snared a Tucker Redden liner at shortstop, Post 96 was unable to add to its two-run lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the bottom of the second, Tyler Stickels ran out an infield hit to third base but West Hartford turned a 5-4-3 double play to squash the threat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol wasn’t finished as Dylan Woodsome (1-for-2) flashed a single to center and eventually stole second base but Matt Beaucar grounded out to end the rally with Post 96 still in charge, 2-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dooley led off the third inning with a base-on-balls but another double play was on deck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, Woodsome hustled in right to snare LaSpada’s blooper for an out and the fielder quickly chucked the ball to first - getting Dooley in a bang-bang double play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seidman walked with two away but Hanawalt looked at strike three as Canzellarini was hanging in midway through the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Chris Osuch started the bottom of third by getting thrown at by Pyrro and Norris followed with a picture perfect sacrifice bunt to put the lead runner in scoring position.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill advanced Osuch to third on a groundout to short while Adam Caron induced a walk as runners were on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Ryan Fradette (2-for-3, two RBI) smashed a ball to the gap in right, clearing the bases, as it became a brand new game at 2-2 entering the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Hartford got one back when Chelli drew a one-out walk in the fourth for the visiting aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He later swiped second and Dave Cantarella sent Chelli home as his base hit up the middle gave Post 96 a 3-2 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redden and Dooley were then hit by back-to-back pitches, loading things up, but LaSpada flew out to Fradette in center to keep it a one run game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought Alex did a good job,” said LaPenta. “If somebody told me we’d be down 3-2 in the fifth, I would have taken it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cantarella made all three putouts in left field for West Hartford in the fourth as Bristol trailed 3-2 going into the top of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the wheels fell off the wagon for the home team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seidman started the fifth by slapping a single into left, ending Canzellarini’s stint on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron then came in to throw, walking Hanawalt which put two on with no one out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seidman then stole third and when the pickoff throw skidded into left, the runner easily scored to make it a 4-2 game in Post 96’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albino followed with a one-hopper to center and when Caron fanned Chelli, a passed ball allowed Hanawalt to score, making it 5-2 - all without an out on the board.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pyrro walked to load things up and Cantarella scooped up an RBI single to put Post ahead by four (6-2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redden earned an RBI walk - making it a 7-2 game - and Churchill took the mound in place of Caron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This game was going to be tough to pull out because of where our pitching is at,” said LaPenta.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the bases still loaded, and no one out, Dooley notched a two-RBI single to left as the Zone 1 leader etched up a 9-2 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol generated two quick outs, including a Churchill K, but Hanawalt just snuck the ball out of the reach of Post 2’s pitcher - scoring Redden - as the home team trailed 10-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And finally, Albino canned a double to left, scoring two additional runs, making it 12-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were really out of pitching,” said LaPenta. “We had nothing left. I had to save something for tomorrow [against Simsbury].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caron staved off the mercy rule with a two-out single to left - advancing to second on a passed ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fradette then dropped a base hit into left and when Caron tried to score, he was called out at the plate as West Hartford moved to 15-0 in over the 12-2 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol didn’t dwell on this one for long as Post 2 squares off against Simsbury in the regular season game of the season on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tomorrow is a big game,” said LaPenta of the Simsbury challenge. “We want to come back and get a ‘W’ before the playoffs. Hopefully, we’ll get back on a winning track.”</p>
