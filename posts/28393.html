<p>About ten years ago to this day, the Bristol Greeners – then of the Connecticut Tri-State Baseball League – were in the midst of their best season in program history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the year at 19-7 overall and nearly found its way into the 2013 World Series – nabbing a 1-0 lead over powerful Tri-Town in the North Division best-of-three series.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the Greeners ended up losing to the Trojans two games to one, Bristol was a talented group – wining 11 of its final 12 regular season games to enter the postseason with plenty of momentum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of that run came on July 14, 2013 in a twin bill against the Naugatuck Dogs and Prospect Chargers from Page Park in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol head coach Shawn Mirmina had an experienced group which included David Casanova, Nick Palmisano, Tyler Bush, Marco Ross, TJ Wyrebek, Steve Clout, John Pastyrnak, Jimmy Hahn, Geoff Pierce, Joey Randall, Mat Niedzwiecki, Steve Julius, Carlson Helms, Bryan Wyrebek, Bret Clark, Adam Peters, Mike Randall, Ryan Dudzinski, Matt Godbout, Joe Galvin, Timmy Georgen, Tyler Cyr and Justin Tacinelli.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad had tremendous pitching, defense to boot and plenty of veteran leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol shutout both teams it faced on July 14, defeating the Dogs 1-0 and then zapping the Chargers by a 4-0 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In game one, it was the arm of Bryan Wyrebek leading the Greeners past Naugatuck.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with the shutout, he gave up just four hits while fanning 11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wyrebek allowed just one walk as the Dogs were scratching their heads at the plate all afternoon long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He fell behind some batters, threw a good [number] of pitches but he’s a battler,” said Mirmina of Bryan Wyrebek to the Bristol Observer. “He was kind of a last minute decision because Mat Niedzwiecki was supposed to start for us but his back tightened up on him. It was more of a spot-start for Wyrebek.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all it took offensively for Bristol was a groundout by TJ Wyrebek – leading to a double play – but Bryan Wyrebek came home to score the game’s lone run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bush was hit-by-a-pitch during first inning play and had to leave the game while TJ Wyrebek and Ross were the only batters from Bristol to generate a hit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in game two, Prospect couldn’t sort out the pitches from former St. Paul Catholic standout Joey Randall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was his first win of the year over his four inning, four hitter. He retired 11 of the 12 batters he faced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Every start, he’s throwing a little bit more,” said Mirmina of Randall. “He started off [throwing] with one inning, then he went two [and] today, he went four. He’s fine in his location and that was the biggest thing for him. The velocity is there but getting back from Tommy John [surgery], he’s more worried about the location right now.” &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Randall struck out five then made way for Bush, throwing a one-hitter the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the third inning, an RBI infield single by Palmisano led to a quick 1-0 edge as Prospect never answered, eventually losing the contest by four runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Casanova went 2-for-2 with a triple while Palmisano was 2-of-3 with a double and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victorious doubleheader saw the Greeners move to 9-4 on the season as Bristol was driving to the playoffs with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>That season was the Tri-State Baseball League’s 80<sup>th</sup> season of play…The 19 victories was the most ever by the Bristol contingent since the inception of the team by Mirmina in 2009.</p>
