<p>The Bristol Eastern baseball team suffered a 10-0 loss to Platt on Friday evening, in a game played at Muzzy Field. The game was called after five innings of play, due to the mercy rule.</p>

<p>Platt took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first against Eastern starter Caleb Molinsky. &nbsp;Leadoff hitter Brandon Candelora singled to left to open the game, stole second, went to third on a fly-ball out to center, and then scored on a wild pitch.</p>

<p>In the second inning, with two outs and a Platt runner on first, an Eastern infield error on a routine force out at second kept the inning alive for Platt, and opened the flood gates for a huge rally.  The next six batters all reached base, with Platt scoring six times to take a 7-0 lead.  </p>

<p>Key hits in the inning were a two- run double to right center off the bat of Hunter Sinovic, a two- run single to left by Zack Baker, and another two- run single hit by Dylan Link.  Jonny Montgomery relieved Molinsky and got the final out of the inning.</p>

<p>The Eastern bats were quiet for the most part, as the Lancers collected only three hits for the game, a second inning single by Rio Fernandez, a fourth inning infield single by Ben D’Amato, and a single by Anthony Nocera to open the fifth. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Platt turned a double play to end the second inning,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;turned&nbsp;an unassisted double play by shortstop Ryan Zauner in the fifth to end the game. &nbsp;(catching a line drove off the bat of Cole&nbsp;Chaivanik&nbsp;and then doubling up Nocera at second).</p>

<p>Montgomery &nbsp;kept&nbsp;Platt scoreless until the fifth, when a double by&nbsp;Tyler Cioffi&nbsp;scored the eighth run, and a two-&nbsp;run single by Candelora scored the final two. &nbsp;Candelora was a perfect 3-3&nbsp;(with a walk)&nbsp;on the day, with&nbsp;two stolen bases,&nbsp;two runs scored and two rbi’s.</p>

<p>Eastern falls to 7-12 on the season, while Platt improved their mark to 13-6. </p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
