<p>The Registrar's office is getting a number of calls about Northeast Middle School and its availability as a polling place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is, but one of its entrances has been closed as part of the new Northeast Middle School construction project.</p>

<p>"Yes," said administrator of elections and assistant registrar Jennifer Brunoli in an email, "Northeast Middle School will be a polling place this election. The registrars advise voters to please use the Felice Road entrance and not the Stevens Street entrance as the Stevens Street is closed off due to construction."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The office has been receiving between five and 10 calls a day, she said. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Everyone so far has thought the school was closed and the polling location would be different but that's not the case," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the Northeast location, a new school is being constructed and is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. It will include state-of-the-art classrooms, a library/media center with a variety of digital and print resources, advanced science labs and collaborative learning spaces.</p>
