<p>It has already been an excellent start for the Bristol boys lacrosse coop – made up of athletes from both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern High Schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, the program is a slick 3-0 with victories over the Northwest United coop, Enfield, and Tolland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol team has scored 25 goals to date as several players have already gotten into the scoring mix.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, led by Max Stavens in the net, the squad allowed just 10 total goals – including the shoutout against Enfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On April 1, the Bristol coop squared off against the Northwest squad – playing its first ever varsity match - to open the season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bristol came away with a huge 8-4 triumph.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaden Glasper chipped in a game-high three goals for Bristol in his debut for the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Bristol, Ian Reardon and Aiden Collins notched two goals apiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vinny Howley also scored for the winners while Stavens played a strong net game, zipping up 14 saves along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wins continued into Monday as Bristol blanked Enfield over a 10-0 final and then on Wednesday, April 5, the locals scored a huge upset victory over Tolland – taking the match 7-6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reardon had another heavy hand in the offense with four goals while Brady Bell added four assists to the winning effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glasper punched through two goals, Chase Dauphinee nabbed one goal and one assist while defensively, Stavens was at it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, both Dylan Brown and Stavens held the fort defensively during the huge win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown tallied eight ground balls while Stavens stopped 13 shots, allowing just six goals over another outstanding effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means Bristol is a quick 3-0 to start the season with Newington on deck on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time for that encounter is 4:30 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of Bristol’s home lacrosse matches take place from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
