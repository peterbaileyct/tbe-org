<p>Families across Bristol are gearing up for a day of festivities as the second annual Family Fun Day returns to the Open Field at BAIMS this Saturday. </p>

<p>Organized by Making Bristol Better in collaboration with the Bristol Early Childhood Alliance and United Way of West Central Connecticut, the event promises a wealth of entertainment, activities, food and community engagement.</p>

<p>“We are excited to have expanded our event to include more vendors and more trucks for our touch-a-truck area,” executive director of operations for the Bristol Child Development Center Maegan Adams said, “and hope that families are able to come out to enjoy the day with their kids while learning about resources available in Bristol.”</p>

<p>From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., attendees can indulge in a variety of family-friendly activities including seed planting, temporary tattoos, face painting and the Foam Truck from Rolling Video Games of New England where children can immerse themselves in playful suds and foam.</p>

<p>The popular touch-a-truck activity will showcase vehicles from Bristol Fire and Police Departments, D’Amato Construction Co., AZ Roofing and Skytop Motors. A special attraction at 11:30 a.m. will feature a SkyHealth helicopter landing directly on the Open Field at BAIMS.</p>

<p>New this year is the "Author’s Corner" that will feature authors reading from their original works throughout the day.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have secured four authors for our newly added 'Author’s Corner' where we will have an author reading one of their stories every half an hour,” Adams said. “With thanks to our sponsors, we will also have a Rolling Video Games of New England Foam Truck and limited food vouchers to provide to families.”</p>

<p>Over 40 vendors and local organizations dedicated to children's well-being will be on-site, including the Bristol Public Library Children’s Department, Barnes Nature Center, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and various youth athletic organizations such as Bristol Little League and Flips Gymnastics. Culinary delights will abound with offerings from Kraftwich Food Truck, Greers Cluck Truck, Spot on Tacos, and Daren’s Ice Cream.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
