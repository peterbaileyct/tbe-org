<p>After defeating Edwin O. Smith on Monday, the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse program had CCC South foe Enfield in its collective sights on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in a romp, the Lancers were big 17-5 victors - winning their third straight game in a row, moving to 3-2 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown on the road saw Eastern drop Enfield to 1-2 overall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Emma Stavens was here, there, and everywhere - notching over forty-percent of the program’s total goals that day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens dropped in seven goals and added three assists over another big time effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Hartley nearly notched a half-dozen goals as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She ended the contest with five goals and teammate Vanessa Drury added four goals and a couple assists to the winning effort.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kenzie Aparo found offenders slipping in the seams of the Enfield defense, dishing out three assists to augment the offensive attack.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meg Krok, Kate Patterson (one goal) and Taigan Parent all gave something over the winning effort for the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the defensive end, Jayna Hatcher, Carolyn Wilson, and Gabby McClay all played well to limit the Eagles to just five total goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hatcher led the charge in ground balls, winning several of those along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And keeper Avery Ellis made all the big stops for another victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On Deck</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is in action twice this coming week with city series play commencing on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s when the Lancers travel to Maltby Street to square off against St. Paul Catholic at 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Friday, it’s a quick trip to Wethersfield in a CCC South battle (3:45 p.m.).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Credit belongs to Eastern as the Kingstreeters had to wait for the bus to Enfield which showed up a bit late. The contest, slated for a 1 p.m. start, ended up commencing at 1:45 instead.&nbsp;</p>
