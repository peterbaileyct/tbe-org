<p>Come Sunday morning, Ramadan will have begun, that was on Wednesday, March 22, and ends with Eid al-Fitr, a major<strong> </strong>holiday in the Muslim tradition on April 20. Between now and then, practicing Muslims will fast from sunup to sundown.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the month-long fast, I try to keep this in mind, as many students in the high school will be honoring this tradition as well as many others who are out and about living their lives--and most will not say a word, either to make excuses or to make it appear that this is anything out of the ordinary. </p>

<p>And, of course, from April 5 to April 13, those of the Jewish faith tradition will celebrate Passover. And those in my own tradition, Christian, specifically, Catholic Christian, are in Lent and approaching Psalm Sunday and Easter Sunday, April 2 and April 9, respectively. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christians, for which there are many denominations, have different approaches to the Easter celebration. For me, it is a meatless fast of Fridays and Mass attendance on Sundays, centering prayer, journaling and taking time to read/listen to religious material. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think it is important to have some grounding in a faith tradition, even if it means discomfort with the tradition. Being raised in a liberal democracy (that is a definition of our political system--liberal democracy being defined as one where individuals have rights and freedoms, protected by the government, and the government operates by the rule of law), it is difficult not to question authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That questioning is part of the American DNA, isn’t it? In the face of the sex abuse scandal facing the Catholic Church, what is more natural than to ask, how is it that this could happen? A second question following on the heels of that is, how is it possible to remain Catholic in the wake of such a scandal? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answers might come from anywhere. For me, one of the places to look is the Center for Action and Contemplation, founded by Franciscan Richard Rohr.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Specifically, and surprisingly, I have turned to a CAC-sponsored podcast featuring Brain McLaren, who has written a book, "Do I Stay Christian?" that intrigues me (but one I haven’t picked up, turning to the podcast instead). McLaren is not a Catholic but part of something called the emerging church movement. </p>

<p>This week I listened to an episode of his “Learning How to See” podcast, entitled, “Re-Wild (featuring Todd Wynward).” It brings up a bunch of issues that face Christians today and provides an interesting take on belief and action. For the podcast, click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/re-wild-feat-todd-wynward/id1532685433?i=1000600115103" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<p>Three TBEers will have attended last week's Connecticut Forum, "Misinformation and Finding the Truth," featuring Stephen Hayes of The Dispatch, Brooke Gladstone of On the Media and Ronan Farrow, who covered the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal for the New Yorker. John Dankoski, executive editor of the New England News Collaborative. </p>

<p>In our attempt to refashion local news coverage, TBE tries to keep informed and learn from the experience of others. This conversation at the Bushnell—if you haven’t attended a CT Forum event, it’s akin to eavesdropping on a captivating&nbsp;discussion—brought up the importance of good quality local journalism as an antidote to some of the cracks in our society that drive us&nbsp;apart.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, we took notes and will be attending to some of the suggestions over the coming year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For reading, I am still making my way through Ernest Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls," and as I might have said a few times already, it is a nice surprise. Hemingway, an old white guy, provides some keen insights into the human condition in times of war. He makes some interesting social commentary, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
