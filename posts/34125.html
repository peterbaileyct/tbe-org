<p>The Democratic Town Committee has partnered with Peyton’s Promise to provide free school supplies to Bristol educators through the newly unveiled Teacher Supply Closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We're just really excited to be able to show appreciation for the people that do the hardest work,” said Board of Education member Maria Simmons. “I'm an educator, and I feel like the hardest work is done by the people that are having the direct contact with students.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simmons, who has worked in the education field as a superintendent of schools, principal and special education teacher, said she feels that it’s important to support strong school-family community partnerships.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re really rooted in our values of supporting the entire education community,” said Simmons. “We listened to the educators in our community. We tried to survey the people that are doing the work in the classrooms so that we can support their needs.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Teacher Supply Closet is located at 430 North Main St. inside the 2023 Democratic Town Committee headquarters and will be open every Thursday from 6 – 8 p.m. through Nov. 2. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The large array of school supplies available to educators includes composition notebooks, pencils, crayons, tape and scissors. The supply closet is also stocked with essential personal products like tissues, feminine hygiene products, deodorant and hand sanitizer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We know teachers pay a lot out of pocket for supplies every year, and we were thinking how we can help,” said Board of Education member Shelby Pons. “We know they need so much, and we want to do what we can to support them. If we hear that there is something that a teacher needs that we don’t have here today, we are going to try and get it for them.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pons, who works for the State Department of Education, said that the DTC worked together to anticipate the needs of classroom supplies for educators and will continue to expand their inventory based on feedback provided by educators.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Democratic Town Committee will host the grand opening of their 2023 headquarters from 5 -7 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 16. Voters will have the opportunity to meet the Democratic slate of candidates and enjoy refreshments and light food offerings. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
