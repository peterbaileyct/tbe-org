<p>PLAINVILLE - The girls tennis program from Bristol Eastern nearly pulled off a huge victory over a pesky Plainville platoon on Monday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Lancers were just one set win away from taking its second match of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Blue Devils just hung on to win, seizing a 4-3 victory in a CCC South engagement from the tennis courts at Plainville High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters fell to 1-9 on the season but nearly swept singles action and just missed earning a trip to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chuck Radda’s troops had to sweat it out to the end from the courts on Locust Street in Plainville as Barbara Lessard’s Lancers made a great showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 1 singles action, Eastern’s Brooke Treannie defeated Vicky Hamel by set scores of 6-0 and 6-1 while in the second slot, the Lancers’ Adrianna Reay, improving throughout the season, spun Bella Apruzzese (6-1, 6-2) for the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The No. 4 singles match saw Eastern’s Taylor Berube wrap up duplicate 6-4 victories over Juliana Radziewicz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the swing match nearly went Eastern’s way as in No. 3 singles play, Eastern freshman Vanessa Cyr and Plainville sophomore Teresa Lopez went to the wire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez picked up the first set (6-2) but the freshman bounced right back, grabbing a 6-4 win in the second - knotting the score up at 1-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A tiebreaker was needed and it seemed like a winner was never going to be declared as both players battled back and forth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Lopez picked up a 12-10 win - the only triumph for Plainville in singles play that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blue Devils ended up sweeping in doubles action as the No. 1 duo of Kimmy Kiques and Peyton Stehle defeated Ava Gesner and Trisha Mohan by similar 6-4 set scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In No. 2 play, Plainville’s Diana Czereba and Emily Serrano-Aviles won over Eastern’s Maria Perrone and Jazzlyn Pryce (6-1, 6-3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, in the third doubles position, it was the combination of Christine Dia and Sammy Shumbo winning over Eastern’s Samantha Rivard and Bella Davis by 6-2 and 6-4 set scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a busy week for the Eastern girls tennis program as the Kingstreeters square off against RHAM of Hebron on Tuesday and then on Wednesday, Middletown travels to Bristol for CCC South action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both matches commence at 3:45 p.m. with Bristol Central on tap for Friday.</p>
