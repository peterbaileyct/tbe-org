<p>STORRS - Dismissing what the Bristol Eastern girls soccer team accomplished in 2021 would be foolish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because after a rough and rocky start to the campaign, the squad eventually played much better and managed to qualify for the state tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An 0-3 start flipped into a quality 5-5-2 finish to end the regular season and, in turn, earned a spot in the Class L postseason bracket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First round play saw the 27th ranked Lancers battle No. 6 Edwin O. Smith in what turned into a CCC Interdivisional confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the 3-0 shutout from Storrs ended Eastern’s season, Lancers’ coach Scott Redman reported that the final result “was not as lopsided as the scoreboard indicated.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a very competitive game with the Lancers creating numerous chances,” said Redman. “However, in the end, E.O. Smith goalkeeper Mira Mahmoud was too tough to beat and the better team advanced.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten minutes into the fray, the Panthers’ Emma Nohemer blasted a free kick from just outside the 18 into the far upper 90 to give the home squad an 1-0 push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then with about 15 minutes to go in the first half, Smith scored once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, Maddison Hughes found space about 30 yards from goal and lofted a fancy chip shot over the head of Eastern keeper Grace D’Amato for a 2-0 lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That push lasted into half and in the second forty as Smith eventually went into time management mode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“After gaining the lead, E.O. was content sitting back a little more than normal and shuffling in substitutions,&nbsp; in an attempt to stay fresh for a potential three game week,” reported Redman. “BE [showed] a drastic improvement in play from the first meeting of the season, finding more possession and creativity throughout the match.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, with seven minutes remaining in the showdown, Smith’s Paige Raynor tucked in a rebound to put the game away as the home team scooped up a 3-0 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mahmond made four saves for the Panthers while D’Amato, making excellent showings all season long, nabbed eight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match marked the final contest for Eastern seniors Ciara Collins, Maura Cyr, Audra Porowski, Grace D’Amato and Victoria Kosciukiewicz.</p>
