<p>BRISTOL - It’s time for the annual Central Connecticut Conference Girls Basketball Tournament and, for the first time in quite a while, the crew from Bristol Central will be one of the featured programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams easily qualified for the 16-team field, ranked fifth overall due to its outstanding 12-3 CCC ledger this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means a home game from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The opponent will come in the form of No. 12 Avon, going 9-6 in CCC battles and will be a worthy challenger for the surging Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to be an amazing test as the Bristol grouping of Leilani Jackson (10.6 points-per-game), Ariana Rivera (9.4), Brooke Watson (8.7), Nicole Riemer (8.7), Molly McMahon, Julia Pikiell and Central captain Kaley and Laird are looking forward to the postseason challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after an amazing 15-5 regular season ledger, the mission doesn’t change because it’s the CCC Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[We have to] just keep working, keep grinding,” said Central coach Steve Gaudet. “It’s the same mindset we’ve had all year. Just keep grinding, keep pushing, and don’t settle."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time Central and Avon tangled was during that ‘Everyone plays in the postseason’ extravaganza the CIAC put together back in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During that postseason jaunt, the Rams defeated Bulkeley (70-19) in first round play and then picked off Northwest Catholic (52-42) in the semifinals to earn a shot against Avon for the CCC Bracket No. 4 Title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was anyone’s game over the thirty-two minute war but in the end, the Falcons went on a run late to churn out a 33-29 victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central ended up in second place in the CCC South standings this year, snaring a 5-2 ledger which included two victories over rival Bristol Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into the showdown against Avon, the Rams have won six of its past seven games and carries victories over RHAM (ranked 10<sup>th</sup> in the CCC Tournament)and No. 8 New Britain (11-4) who also drew a home game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the program’s best year since the 1999-00 campaign and the team has a chance to tally its most wins since 1988-89 (17-3 overall) which was Central’s best ledger ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that’s not important to Gaudet as the team has bigger goals in mind than statistical milestones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This is a great year, but we’re not done, and I’ve stressed that in the locker room and I’m going to continuing stressing that," said Gaudet.&nbsp;“We’re not done. We’ve still got more goals to accomplish.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Getting done without shooting 3s</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the year, Central has only splashed in 26 three-pointers as a team with Watson leading the way with 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s impressive because every team – seemingly in the universe – uses the long-range bomb, for better or worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High-percentage shots is where it’s at and the Rams do an impressive job attacking inside-out with the likes of Jackson truly thriving in the midrange game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side of town, Bristol Eastern has connected on 80 three-pointers this year, a weapon long time head coach Tony Floyd truly did not embrace until the mid-1990s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four players at Central have tallied six or more threes this season which includes Jackson (four), Lodovico (4) and Molly McMahon who is second on the squad in 3-pointers made with six.</p>
