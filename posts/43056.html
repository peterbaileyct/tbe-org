<p>Workers have begun installing a vintage Seth Thomas clock on the property of the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum on the perimeter of the new parking lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was given to the museum in 2010," said museum executive director Patti Philippon, who was at the museum before 6 a.m. for the arrival of the clock. "At the time we brought it to Electric Time for restoration and they've been very patient with us in getting all the parts in place."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The donation was made just prior to Philippon beginning as executive director, so she has been involved with this project her entire tenure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four-dial post clock was built in 1924, and the delay for restoration, makes it a full 100 years old this year, which is fitting, Philippon said.</p>

<p>"Even though it's taken us a lot longer than we wanted to get here, and get it up, it's perfect timing," she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a back story, too, according to Philippon. The installer, clockmaker and watchmaker Bob Desrochers, has worked with the person who donated the clock, Ted Tweel. Desrochers is from Pennsylvania, Tweel is from West Virgina.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Desrochers actually installed it on Ted's property years and years ago, and then Ted gave it to us, and now he is installing it here. So, it's come full circle," Philippon said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Desrochers has over 40 years-experience in the field and has supervised the design and construction of the $7 million National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pa., as well as being responsible for the preservation and conservation of thousands of artifacts and exhibits, according to his website Timekeepers Workbench. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We are a crazy group," Desrochers said about people involved in the preservation and conservation of clocks, as he checked the delivery, which arrived in wood crates. Shortly afterwards a crane was lifting and moving the clock's base to its permanent location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On hand for the uncrating were museum curator Tom Manning and former board members Ian Roome and Dave Eubank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The installation will take place over four days. Desrochers is working with Sign Pro for the installation. Electric Clock Company, an offshoot of a company that was incorporated in 1928, has been involved with over 10,000 installations of tower and street clocks, according to its website.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
