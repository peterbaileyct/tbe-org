<p>STORRS - University of Connecticut running back Victor Rosa turned a lot of heads during his freshman campaign for the Huskies’ football program in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UConn made a surprise run last year, going 6-6 in the regular season, earning a berth in the 2022 Myrtle Beach Bowl as Rosa and company helped to reestablish the Huskies’ football program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, Rosa is already earning preseason buzz with the regular season less than a month away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over Fifty players, representing all 10 conferences and the independents that compete for the Football Bowl Series, are eligible to earn this prestigious honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The award, now in its 14th season, is given annually to the most versatile player in major college football by the Louisville Sports Commission in memory of the late football legend and Louisville native Paul Hornung,” according to a release from the UConn athletics website. “The winner and his family will be honored at the annual Paul Hornung Award dinner in Louisville, Kentucky [next] March.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa, taking advantage of extra playing time in 2022 under first year head coach Jim Mora, was able to lead the Huskies in all-purpose yards - churning out nearly 1,000 yards (987 yards) overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He rushed for 636 yards on 140 carries, scoring 11 touchdowns which led the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The speedster also scooped in 283 yards on 15 kickoff returns, leading the Huskies in that category as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of his best games came on November 4 against UMass in a showdown from Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against the Minutemen, Rosa made 17 carries, scooped up 87 rushing yards and added a couple touchdowns in UConn’s big 27-10 win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That outstanding performance helped Rosa&nbsp;earn a spot on the Week 10&nbsp;Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the UConn website, “The Paul Hornung Award has created an impressive legacy in 13 years including seven winners who were first-round NFL draft picks – Tavon Austin, Saquon Barkley, Odell Beckham Jr., Christian McCaffrey, Jabrill Peppers, DeVonta Smith and Shaq Thompson.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Oregon State’s Jack Colletto was named the 13th winner of the Paul Hornung Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hornung played collegiately at Notre Dame, eventually playing every position in the offensive backfield during the 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he did everything in the middle as well, playing defense, returned kickoffs, punted and even placekicked over a full career for the Irish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An All-American and a Heisman Trophy winner in 1956, he was the first player selected in the NFL draft, competing professionally for the Green Bay Packers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His Hall of Fame career saw Hornung earn MVP honors in 1961 as a triple-threat halfback and placekicker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He is a member of the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame and made many contributions to the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 2023 Watch List was compiled by a panel of college football experts based on a combination of statistics, career performance, SID recommendations and expectations heading into the 2023 season,” according to UConn website. “In addition to the Watch List, the Paul Hornung Award Weekly Honor Roll will recognize players whose performances during the regular season meet the Award's criteria.” Players from both the Watch List and the Weekly Honor Roll are eligible to win the Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa has tremendous ability, seemingly endless energy and as he helps to push his teammates in practice, the UConn football team is poised for even bigger things in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
