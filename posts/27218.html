<p>NEW BRITAIN - Bristol Central’s boys track &amp; field team did extremely well at the 2023 State Open event on June 5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had a championship performance along the way while making a top-10 finish at the ultra-competitive showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It was a] great day at the State Open Championship,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk. “The Bristol Central boys placed eighth as a team with 20 points!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hall won the Open title for the boys behind a 64-point performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor came in second place (42.75 points) while Xavier of Middletown snared third (38).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bloomfield (53 points) nabbed the Open Championship for the girls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bringing just five boys to the event, one of Central’s athletes was able to tally an Open championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that State Open Title was won by Central senior Tre Blair who promised to make some noise in New Britain even before the event took place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He certainly did that as he won the Triple Jump event - reestablishing the school record along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Treshawn Blair is State Open Triple Jump Champion with a huge jump of 46 feet, 11 inches,” said Stafford-Kirk. “He extended his own school record it by nine inches!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an amazing finish by the senior who will continue on to the New England Championship showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Blair isn’t the only one with his postseason continuing into the month of June in the triple jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anthony Paulino continues to keep Blair on his toes, performing well at the Open to continue on in the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Junior teammate Anthony Paulino placed fourth, jumping over 44 feet for the first time,” said Stafford-Kirk. “His best attempt was 44 feet, 8.5 inches.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the 1600 meters, senior standout Frankie Porrini was tremendous once again, finishing the race in under 4:20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He came in fourth place to earn a slot at the New Englands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Senior captain Frankie Porrini is starting to heat up in the 1600, running 4:16.53, one of the fastest times in school history,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also performing well was Logan Jackson with another big personal record in the 110 hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He placed 10th overall with a time of 15.45, just missing the final cut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wyatt Gibson competed in the javelin, placing 22nd overall with a make of 130, 11 inches off a good toss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Although he didn’t have the performance he wanted, the junior will be back at it next season,” said Stafford-Kirk of Gibson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the girls at Central, junior Kylee Barnes placed fifth in the high jump with a successful attempt at five feet, two inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barnes joined Blair, Porrini, and Paulino at the New England Championships on Saturday, taking place in Bangor, Maine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Coach Bonilla, the other coaches and I are beyond proud of this group of athletes,” said Stafford-Kirk. “They competed with the best in the state today and proved why BC Track &amp; Field is a force to be reckoned with.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Eastern’s Mulcunry also earned a trip to Maine</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern standout Jack Mulcunry continues to amaze in the 800 meters and made a top-four finish at the Open event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over another loaded field, Mulcunry finished the race in 1:54.36 for fourth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury’s Daniel cone won the heat with a time of 1:53.16 to take the 800 meter challenge.</p>
