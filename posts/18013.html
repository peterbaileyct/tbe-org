<p>For the second straight week, the Bristol Central football team dropped a lopsided decision at home Friday night. This one came at the hands of Windsor, the Class L state runner-up a year ago.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams turned the ball over five times with three of them leading to touchdowns, as they were unable to get the offensive untracked.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors intercepted on Central’s first drive of the night and never look back as they improved to 3-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central trailed by just 7-0 after one period, but four scores in the second period gave the Warriors a 35-0 halftime edge and sent then game into running clack mode for the entire second half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor put up 418 yards in total offense with a pair of runners topping the 100-yard rushing mark and freshman quarterback A.J. Robinson hitting on six of seven passes for 111 yards and two touchdowns.</p>

<p>Chili White led the offense for Windsor. He rushed for 114 yards and two touchdowns on 10 carries and caught two passes for 33 yards and a touchdown. Sophomore John Manning also topped the 100-yard rushing mark with 108 yards and two touchdowns on nine carries.</p>

<p>The Rams had a couple of big gain plays in the contest, but for the most part were unable to run a consistent attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had some small flurries of ability to move the ball,” said coach Jeff Papazian, “but we weren’t able to sustain anything and we turned the ball over way too much. A lot of what happened to us offensively tonight was self-inflicted. It’s hard to win when you turn the ball over five times."</p>

<p>Tre Blair led the Central offense with four carries for 42 yards, including a 20-yard run on the first play of the game. Aiden Lamarre had the only two pass catches for the Rams for a net of 28 yards. Quarterback Nik Salinas got just two of 10 passes for those 28 yards and was intercepted three times. The Rams also turned the ball over on fumbles twice.</p>

<p>Central, now 1-4 on the season, moves into its bye week next week. The Rams will try to use the time to regroup and prepare for their Oct. 21 showdown with defending state champion Maloney.</p>
