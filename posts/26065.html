<p>BRISTOL - Winning its eighth match in ten tries, the Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse program zipped up another big victory, scooping up a 13-6 triumph over Enfield on Monday in a CCC South confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after two one-goal losses in their previous two contests, the seven point triumph was a welcomed score by the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, the combination of Emma Stavens and Vanessa Drury tallied eight goals in all.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was four goals apiece for the outstanding offensive duo from Eastern but also doing well on the scoring front was Kate Patterson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The freshmen notched a couple goals to help keep the Eagles off balanced while Shannon Philippon added a score, as did Taigan Parent, to push the Kingstreeters to the pay window once again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Hartley also did well in the offensive trenches, helping her teammates get established and generate a little offense at the Enfield goal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayna Hatcher and Carolyn Wilson played a strong defensive game for the Lancers, allowing just a half-a-dozen goals to cross into the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hatcher led the squad in groundballs that day while keeper Avery Ellis made several critical stops, leading to Eastern’s current record of 8-4 overall with the postseason around the corner.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home stand continues into Thursday as Eastern hosts Windsor in a 7 p.m. bout under the lights.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the regular season concludes with three huge bouts, one against a certain crosstown rival in the mix as well.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big one is next Wednesday when Eastern and Bristol Central tangle for the second time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That showdown takes place at 6 p.m. from the turf field at BCHS.&nbsp;</p>
