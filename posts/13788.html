<p class="has-medium-font-size">Isabelle (Aubin) “Izzy” LaFountain, 79, of Bristol, beloved wife of Howard R. “Howie” LaFountain, died on Monday, May 30, at Bristol Hospital. Izzy was born in Bristol on Sept. 25, 1942, and was a daughter of the late Isadore and Marian (Thibault) Aubin. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">She was a lifelong Bristol resident where she graduated from St. Anthony High School. She attended Goodwin Tech for hairdressing. She was a skilled hairdresser who was loved by all of her clients. She also loved caring for her plants and creating beautiful stained glass items. A meticulous house made her happy. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">She is also survived by a sister, Susan Middleton of North Carolina and many nieces and nephews. Those who she called family are too many to number. She had a special connection to her beloved pet dog, Chubbs. Izzy will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her. Izzy did not require a biological connection to call someone “Family.”</p>
