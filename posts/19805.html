<p>EAST HARTFORD - The UConn football team, after years of expectations that just didn’t come to pass, is on the verge of something very special.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, the Huskies pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies, along with freshman running back and former Bristol Central standout Victor Rosa, defeated No. 19 ranked Liberty 36-33 from Pratt and Whitney Stadium in East Hartford - the squad’s first win against a nationally ranked opponent since 2015.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the triumph, UConn moved to 6-5 overall for the program’s third victory in a row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to that amazing win, the UConn program is now eligible for a bowl bid - a tremendous feat as the team was picked by the&nbsp;<em>experts</em>&nbsp;to finish towards the bottom, if not the bottom, of the national standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From August to November, the Huskies have absolutely flipped the script on the gridiron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa and the Huskies ended the home portion of its campaign with a stellar 5-1 ledger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Bristol Central speedster ended up collecting two touchdowns against nationally ranked Liberty over a 62-yard rushing attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa ran in an early 16-yard touchdown with 10:28 left to play in the first quarter - making it a 7-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then eight seconds into the fourth and final frame, Rosa cashed in on the final carry of an eight play, 75-yard jaunt with a big 27-yard touchdown splurge as the Huskies made it a 28-27 contest in UConn’s favor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa made a mad dash on the scoring play, sprinting towards the UConn sideline but continued his forward push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Needing six yards for a first down, he just beat out every defender in his path - absorbing numerous contact - to nab that touchdown, giving the Huskies a one-point edge to open fourth period play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After losing the lead one last time, Connecticut quarterback Zion Turner found Kevens Clerics for a 30-yard touchdown connection late as UConn went ahead again, this time at 36-33.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then off a huge stop with just seconds remaining in the fray, the Huskies counted down the final ticks on the clock as the final horn sounded and UConn coach Jim Mora got a Gatorade bath with the program from Storrs etching up a huge 36-33 win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Huskies finish up the regular season at Army next Saturday from West Point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa once again showed his mettle and toughness over 10 carries for those 62 yards against Liberty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 27-yard TD score was the longest of the afternoon by the freshman warrior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On special teams, Rosa made two kickoff returns for a total of 42 yards, including a 25-yard jaunt as the Huskies could be playing a little postseason ball if given the opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And a win at Army would help those bowl bid chances grow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday, Army led 9-0 at the half but managed to lose to Troy 10-9 on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Black Knights fell to 3-6 overall and is going to have its collective hands full against the Huskies next week.</p>
