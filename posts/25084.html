<p>The St. Paul offense was overpowering Monday afternoon batting around in 3 of the 7 innings on the way to a 18-7 win over Wolcott. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior pitcher Jamie Leggett picked up the win allowing five runs on seven hits while striking out nine over 5 and 2/3 innings. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Starter Drew Rocca took the loss for Wolcott.</p>

<p>St. Paul began the game with its first seven batters reaching base safely, and took an early 5-0 lead in the top of the 1st inning. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott responded with its first three batters reaching safely in the bottom of the frame. All three scored, and it was 5-3 after one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the Falcons put another five spot on the board in the 2nd inning pounding out five hits including RBI doubles by Devin Kulas and Kyle Wilson. Wolcott had no response this time, and it was 10-3 at the end of the 2nd.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Kilpatrick hit a two run blast over the left field fence to make it 12-3 after three. But St Paul was unable to get another run off Wolcott reliever Nathan Yachtis (to take advantage of the ten run mercy rule) until the top of the 6th when Jonathan Remillard scored on AJ Corrado's RBI groundout. </p>

<p>Up 13-3 in the middle of the 6th, St Paul needed to keep Wolcott from scoring to end the game in six innings. But pinch hitter Hans Ehmer led off with a double, and advanced to 3rd on an infield groundout. With two outs, Jamie Leggett was an out away from a complete game victory, but Nick Sconziano beat out an infield single scoring Ehmer, and the 7th inning would have to be played. </p>

<p>Dom Napoletano replaced Leggett on the mound. Drew Rocca sent Napoletano's first pitch into center for a single. Then AJ Martinez smacked a 1-0 pitch over the right field fence for a three run home run, and Wolcott trailed 13-7 after six.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul batted around for the final time in the top of the 7th. The five run inning featured an RBI double by Leggett, and a three run home run by catcher Cal Chance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Wolcott failed to score in the bottom of the frame, and the final was 18-7.</p>
