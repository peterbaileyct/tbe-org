<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday night, Bristol's Board of Education (BOE) met for its monthly meeting at 129 School St., on an unseasonable damp winter evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the facility at maximum capacity and everyone on the surface playing nice, the members went through their regular course of business professionally, with staff and student recognition, new hires, resignations, and committee reports. However, without doubt, the 800-pound gorilla decamped in the room, and the reason for the tight quarters was the expected fireworks during the public comment section of the meeting and the rumor of a resolution crafted by Republican members to unmask Bristol school students. It's the reason most were there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since at least June, masks in schools have dominated the public comments and have overwhelmed the proceedings with the same 10-20 anti-mask activists in attendance championing the removal of masks from schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In June, the BOE meeting at Bristol Central was suspended because they refused to wear masks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three months later they upped the ante.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About 20 protestors, including men, women, and children, stood on the sidewalk protesting. A revolutionary war drummer tapped out duty calls on his snare drum, with American flags waving and noisemakers filling the air. A man, armed with a bullhorn, called for the resignation of BOE president Jen Dube with catcalls of "Jennifer Dube, resign, you are a disgrace to Bristol!"</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that backdrop, spectators Wednesday witnessed the latest drama in this ongoing battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the authority of an occupying force, 17 speakers of the anti-mask movement seized the microphone and denounced masks in schools; some forcefully, some sarcastically.  Only two speakers found their way to the microphone that supported masks in schools.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six emails were also read into the record condemning masks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next matter before the Board was a resolution drafted by the republican members and addressed to Governor Ned Lamont and members of the state legislature. Their measure requested that policymaking be returned to the local boards of education.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democrats objected to the proposal which caught them flat-footed, despite receiving a draft two days previous. Consequently, they requested the vote be delayed for a month as the Governor is considering lifting the mask mandate. "I think it is premature for us to be considering this resolution until such time as we know the direction that we're going," Board member Chris Wilson said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Republicans were not influenced. Newly elected board member Dante Tagariello dismissed the proposal, "I think this allows the Board of Education to take a position statement, which we have been asked to do multiple times, not just by 1% of this community, but by many, many people. So I will not be voting in favor to postpone the motion."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As expected, the motion to postpone was rejected 6-3 and went along party lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up was the resolution itself.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some will argue that the empaneled republicans were merely responding to the citizens who elected them. While others will offer, the activists won them over because there was no consistent or counter-narrative provided.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Regardless the debate over its merits went as expected with the motion being approved 6-3. The resolution was read into the record by its author and Vice-Chair Kristen Giantonio, which said in part:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"And whereas the people of our town have spoken and expect us to act on their behalf, to defend our constitutional freedoms and to set policies for our town. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Bristol Board of Education in regular session and assembled calls upon the Governor in the state of Connecticut, and the Connecticut General Assembly to rescind any executive or legislative authority created in response to the COVID 19 pandemic that overrides the proper local control of the Board of Education of the city of Bristol and to halt any further similar actions by the executive or legislative branch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Be it further resolved that the Board of Education shall be restored as a policymaking body for the local school district as it was prior to the COVID 19 pandemic and that it shall make policy in keeping with the state and federal constitutions and the consent of the people who elected them to Office."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the 169 towns in Connecticut, none have asked nor received such authority sought in the resolution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democrats were not pleased and Shelby Pons immediately objected and zeroed in, objecting to the language, "the people of our town have spoken and expect us to act on their behalf," section. “I am curious as to know what people have spoken because we represent over 60,000 people in Bristol, and I want to know if we did any type of surveying or we held any community forums. This wasn't even discussed by board members. I'm wondering how we can feel confident to put forth something like this without surveying schools, staff, students, families, and community members." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giantonio advised Pons that there is nothing in the document about masks. <strong>“</strong>We are looking for him (Governor Lamont) to consider that there are local Boards of Education that would like to go back to regular policymaking authority. It was very clear in the first paragraph, and throughout the various clause statements.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the resolution makes no references to masks and despite Giantonio's assurances, it is evident that after months of debate and protests its creation was solely for the elimination of masks. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the democrats not being consulted on the crafting of the document (they were not even aware of its author) and an obvious disagreement over its necessity, the resulting debate revealed underlying tensions between the board members with mild sniping, carping, and a hint of political theatre shown by a majority party member. None of which was necessary or productive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jennifer Dube, Kristen Giantonio, Dante Tagariello, Eric Carlson, John Sklenka, and Todd Sturgeon voted yes on the measure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shelby Pons, Karen Vibert, and Christopher Wilson voted no.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pons and Vibert asked that their names not be attached to the resolution and their request was obliged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some in attendance felt there was coordination between republican members on the Board and the activists. Todd Sturgeon, a republican member of the BOE, during an exchange on Facebook with a local resident acknowledged he was invited and attended an anti-mask meeting.  His mere attendance at the meeting is not proof of an organized and coordinated effort between the republican members of the board and the anti-mask group. </p>
