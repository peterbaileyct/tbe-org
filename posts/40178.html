<p>BRISTOL - There’s never a dull moment in scholastic hoops when the JV squads from Bristol Eastern and Maloney take the court.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest on Friday night between the programs proved that very fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the varsity main event, the JV team put one heck of a show in a tight contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Kingstreeters were able to pull out a three point victory over Maloney in dramatic fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the contest all tied up at 62-62, the Lancers had the ball, the shot clock was off and the locals were holding it for one last attempt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Eastern guard Dante DePass, tightly guarded, was prepared to hit the game-winning shot if the ball came his way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the veteran came through in the clutch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the game hanging in the balance and the buzzer about to go off, leading to a possible overtime situation, DePass made it academic as he smoothly canned a baseline 3-pointer at the buzzer as the Lancers JV program defeated Maloney by a 65-62 final in a CCC South bonanza.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was bedlam as DePass made the long distance shot and once the referees signified that the trifecta was good, the celebration began.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass’s game-winner was one heck of a shot as he was hiding in plain sight, in corner opposite of the Eastern bench.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naseem Walker was dribbling out the final seconds of regulation and had DePass in his sights from the start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass was ready for the ball, Walker dumped it over to the shooter and the junior splashed it in cleanly for the game winning hoop, sending the squad - and the home crowd - into a frenzy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass led all scores with 25 points while Walker added 13 to pace the victors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The JV’s got a nice win,” said Eastern varsity coach Bunty Ray. “Dante was able to hit a 3 at the buzzer.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>DePass and Walker also earned some time in the varsity showdown against Maloney, helping the program pick up a 60-41 win from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big triumph for Eastern and JV head coach Brett Bisson.</p>
