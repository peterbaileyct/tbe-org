<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL – There’s a new assistant principal over at Bristol Eastern High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you’ve ever been to a girls soccer game on King Street lately, observing a certain coach <em>nicely</em>&nbsp;talking to the officials in a very loud tone, you know exactly who that tremendous individual is. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, physical education teacher and girls soccer coach Scott Redman was elevated to the position of assistant principal at Bristol Eastern.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman has left a bit of a coaching void as the long-time mentor did a great job with both the soccer and softball programs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So for now, there won’t be any more games with Redman on the sidelines, wearing shorts in frigid weather and donning a ridiculous cowboy like hat that made him look like he was about to hop onto a choo-choo train for a ride (for the record, Redman claimed that the ‘cowboy looking hat’ was gifted to him by Eastern football coach Anthony Julius. If you’re going to spend your hard-earned money on something, how about purchasing a nice pair of warm socks instead?).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman was an ever-present voice on the sidelines of Alumni Field who was never afraid to voice his displeasure to a referee, to complement an opponent or tell one of his players to get the lead out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you heard any kind of yelling from Alumni Field in the fall or the softball field in front of BEHS over the years, it was probably Redman in rare form.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But any of Redman’s assistant coaches along the way realizes all the positive contributions he’s made for the sports programs at both Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s my guy,” said Nate Jandreau, Redman’s former assistant coach and friend. “He was the best man at my wedding. He’s been doing this 17 years and I think I was with him 16 years ago at Central. I’ve learned a lot from him on the sidelines.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman is going to be a tremendous assistant principal and he’ll just help lead a bigger team and the challenge will be a year-round endeavor.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what’s Redman going to miss the most about not coaching anymore?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think the competition,” said Redman. “The competition, I miss it as a player. Now having my own family, I don’t play as much myself so I don’t get that competitive outlet. So coming in, scouting an opponent and creating a game plan and executing a game plan [is what I enjoy].”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Redman helped to engineer some tremendous game-winning matches, drawing critical ties and battling some of the state's best squads in the Central Connecticut Conference despite his program being at a bit of a competitive disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a huge 0-0 stalemate at Simsbury on October 13, 2021, a program that ended up in the Class L championship bout to end the campaign. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the season, it was a 2-1 signature triumph over Wethersfield.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those big wins helped fuel his squad and validate what the programs he’s coached have accomplished over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As early as a couple years ago, we tied Simsbury and they go to a state final,” said Redman. “We beat Wethersfield [that same year]. They go to the semifinals. That’s what I really like, being that underdog and beating a team is what I thrive off of as a coach.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t just the wins and losses that kept Redman in the coaching game for all those years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also been all the young student-athletes he’s been able to help through life via sports.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those life lessons, passing off knowledge to countless students, is something Redman will miss that comes from more than hitting a ball or kicking in a goal.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think those lessons that goes beyond athletics, making an impact on an athlete where they learn that adversity, they learn those challenges, they learn how to overcome those challenges, those injuries and when they think they have nothing left in the tank and then find it,” said Redman. “Sometimes when you think the tank is empty, you have more. Sometimes you think you’re at rock bottom, [and] you have to pick yourself up and you have to push yourself forward.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The last couple of years where we struggled, those were the lessons.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman also helped foster a positive environment where his players made lasting friendships and created moments that will stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The long-time coach preaches positivity and those players are all the better for it years after they leave the school on King Street.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s helped out a lot of kids in Bristol,” said Jandreau. “And he’s done a lot for soccer in Bristol, the girls on both sides of this town. And he’s right up there with all those other girls soccer coaches that have done so much for those girls because he’s done it forever.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re going to miss him.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end…&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Redman is on a new team and has a new challenge which includes mounds of paperwork and long hours sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Assistant principals have a plethora of duties and responsibilities, helping to mentor the students and guide them along their scholastic journey which is truly in Redman’s wheelhouse of abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, he’s been a great fit on Principal Mike Higgins’ team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s an opportunity to make a broader impact on a lot of kids,” said Redman of the job. “I hope I can bring that same positive energy to this new team and hopefully make an impact on even more kids.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the shorts and cowboy hat have been put away, perhaps someday, Redman will be back on the sidelines, yelling at referees and enjoying a little more on turf tomfoolery as a coach – whether in shorts or not.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s going to be sad to see him go,” said Jandreau. “[But] he was always wearing shorts, no matter what the weather is…”&nbsp;</p>
