<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - Every scholastic team needs the likes of Kaley&nbsp;Laird involved in its program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know the type: determined, hardworking, successful and most importantly, driven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls basketball squad over at Bristol Central is extremely lucky to have the senior in the mix for twenty regular season games - along with a postseason game, or three (at least) - from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And long-time head coach Steve Gaudet knows how fortunate he’s been to have the crafty athlete a big part of his team as the lone senior representative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s probably one of my favorite kids that I’ve ever coached,” said Gaudet of Laird. “She’s so unselfish. She does everything for the team. She cheers on her teammates, and she organizes everything outside, off the court.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who else can score a season-high six points and make the biggest impact on the game?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her value has been defense and leadership which are things you can’t buy from the local Woolworth, Kmart or Bradlees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just her sitting on the bench of the Class L volleyball team this past year, Laird elevated the program with her cheers, good vibes and encouragement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird is the ultimate teammate and that gets proven time and time again in every sport she plays.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some nights, she won’t score any points on the hardwood and Laird will still have the biggest smile on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She knows what fuels the team at Central, an intangible quality called chemistry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sees oozes chemistry in every sport she participates on at the scholastic level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In every sport she plays, whether it’s basketball or softball, Laird brings that element of togetherness to the team she’s competing on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s talented, especially on the softball field at shortstop, second base or anywhere you put her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On her way to play softball at Eastern Connecticut State University, she’ll probably scoop up another CCC South All-Conference honor (and perhaps a state title) along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s overcome so much at such a young age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When sickness and illness tried to derail her, Laird just – somehow, someway – powered through it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She beat all the odds, just like the teams she competes on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She’s dealt with a lot, and you’d never know it,” said Gaudet. “She’s so selfless and only cares about the team and winning. I’m so happy [because] my team is so young. They learn from her and see what kind of team player she is and how she puts the team first.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s amazing to me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird is the perfect role model for any young female athlete to emulate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply put, the Indiana National Guard could be deployed to contain Laird and the senior wouldn’t be slowed in the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Congratulations&nbsp;to Laird on steering Central’s ultra-successful girls basketball team to one of its best basketball seasons ever in program history (16-6).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This spring, they’ll be more to come from the crafty Laird (probably more dancing in the infield as well between innings).</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
