<p>Singers looking to join the Bristol Chorale for its 2024-2025 season will have an opportunity when the chorale holds open rehearsals on two successive Monday evenings, beginning next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The choir welcomes new members, and invites singers and would-be singers of all shapes, sizes, voice parts and musical persuasions to join the group. The only requirement to join is that singers must be 18 years or older. There are no auditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year the chorale is especially looking for tenors and basses, and we invite all potential new members to an open rehearsal on Sept. 9 or Sept. 16 (or both), at St. Andrew Church, 1125 Stafford Ave., at 6:45 p.m. Plan to arrive by 6:30 p.m. to be greeted and receive music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, this year marks the debut of a new musical director. Andrew Skinner has taught chorale in public schools for 12, first in Chelsea, Mass., and now at Torrington Middle School. He is also music director for theater productions in Torrington and neighboring communities, and serves as the junior chorus director for Chorus Angelicus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He succeeds Rich Theriault who retired last year, from directing both the Bristol Chorale and the Bristol Brass and Wind Ensemble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Chorale is made up of members of the Bristol community as well residents from surrounding towns. Group membersâ€™ musical skill sets vary from beginner to somewhat accomplished.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
