<p>Hiam A. Suckor, a life-long Bristol resident, bought 200 Powerball tickets for last Saturday’s $1.4 billion drawing but unfortunately did not have the winning ticket. Hiam was convinced he had the winning answer when he got an email Friday afternoon from an on-line psychic who had picked the winning numbers for several other Powerball drawings.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The psychic, a woman named Gymme Yurmoney, even posted the winning numbers from the last five drawings, which she said she had predicted days in advance. Hiam used PayPal to send $57 to Mrs. Yurmoney, and she forwarded her predictions to him for Saturday’s drawing.</p>

<p>There were 200 combinations in all that Yurmoney sent to Hiam, with a guarantee that one of them would be the winner.</p>

<p>When all was said and done, Hiam was out $400 for the 200 tickets, plus the $57 sent to the psychic. He also could not get his money back, because the psychic website disappeared.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hiam said he was pretty upset at his bad fortune, but he learned a valuable lesson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said he planned to make his money back by playing on-line solitaire, as he had seen several testimonials from dozens of people who were making hundreds of dollars a day with the on-line game.</p>
