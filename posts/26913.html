<p>The Falcon offense batted around in each of the first 4 innings to take a commanding 18-0 lead. And while the offense was clicking, pitchers Jamie Leggett, Dom Napoletano, and Ryan McKenna limited Terryville to two runs on five hits while striking out eleven. Jamie Leggett picked up his 7th win of the season and Brayden Evans took the loss for Terryville.</p>

<p>Charlie Rogers picked up Terryville's only hit against Leggett with a single in the top of the 1st, but was unable to advance beyond 1st base. </p>

<p>In the bottom of the frame, Logan Rembish led off and walked. Rembish scored on Devin Kulas' RBI single, and Kulas scored on Cal Chance's RBI single. After Cole Raymond was hit by a pitch, both he and Chance scored on AJ Corrado's two out, two RBI single, and St Paul led 4-0 after one inning.</p>

<p>Five walks, a hit batter, an RBI double by Raymond, and a two RBI single by Rembish allowed St. Paul to extend the lead to 10-0 after two. A single by Raymond with RBI hits by Rembish, Chance, and Jonathan Remillard made it 14-0 after three. And four walks, an error, a SAC fly by Rembish, and an RBI single by Remillard made it 18-0 after four.</p>
