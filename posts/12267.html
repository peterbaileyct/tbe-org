<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central track and field program should be one of the featured squads in all the CCC South this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the teamâ€™s opener against Berlin on Tuesday, the Rams belted the Redcoats via a 113-37 throttling in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was nearly a demolition as Central won every relay event and took all the running challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the hurdles, indoor state champion Jarrett Boxley won both the 110 (14.9 seconds) and 300 (43.5 seconds) meter events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Victor Rosa, straight off a Class L basketball championship, was a multiple race winner as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa ran the 100 meters in a blazing 11.17 seconds and took the 200 (22.7 seconds) as well while Boxley and Rosa made up half of the winning 4x100 relay team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The duo joined Cassias Breland and Logan Jackson, winning the relay event in 44.17 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Frankie Porrini was a triple winner on an individual front before helping the 4x800 meter relay team to victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini nabbed first place wins in the 1600 (4:42), 800 (2:03.4), and 3200 meters (10:37).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the 4x800 relay combination of Chris Roy, Patrick Wininger, Lance Archibald and Porrini earned the win in 8:52.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 400 meters, Noah Conrod finished first in 52.76 seconds and then the 4x400 squad of Logan Jackson, Conrod, Mitchell Peterson, and Cassias Breland were the winners in 3:59.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the field, Treshawn Blair was a triple winner for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He earned the wins in the long jump (20 feet, eight inches), triple jump (40 feet, seven inches), and high jump (five feet, eight inches) while Malachi Jones threw the shot put a distance of 46 feet, six inches to earn first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And fellow football stud Dan Lauretti was a dual victor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nabbed wins in both the discus with a toss of 125 feet, eight inches and pulled out the victory in the javelin (116 feet, 10 inches).</p>
