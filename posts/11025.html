<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central boys basketball team has three tests to pass this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not exactly exam time but in the hardwood sense, it’s absolutely a huge three-game challenge to master</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Test one was a confrontation against Platt on Monday and the squad earned an ‘A’ for its efforts - belting the CCC South rival by 31 points over a 79-48 thumping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the evaluation gets a bit more difficult on Wednesday as Central travels to the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams cap a triple-header of tremendous action as top rated Central squares off against Wilbur Cross in a huge non-conference confrontation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 8 p.m. and it’s a huge showdown in the Governors’ home base.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I told my guys this is tournament week,” said Central coach Tim Barrette. “When I say tournament week, it’s a different mentality you need to have. We had it during the CCC tournament [last year]. We had it yesterday at practice.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cross (8-5) is currently on a two-game losing streak and fell out of the state’s top-ten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad is a double-tough outfit but the Governors have an uphill climb against Donovan Clingan and company.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central might get to the facility a little bit early to take in the second contest of the evening, pitting Hillhouse against No. 3 Windsor in the first CCC/SCC tilt that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next week, the Warriors come to Bristol for another huge showdown from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Friday, the final exam is Berlin and head coach Stan Glowiak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Redcoats hit BCHS for a CCC South battle at 6:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be another epic challenge for the Rams against Berlin’s veteran coach knows all the tricks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it’s going to be tough to top this squad from Central - currently on a state best 28-game winning streak with seven more contests to play before the postseason arrives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Barrette knows his squad will be more than ready for the upcoming ‘tests’ this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I tell you all the time, these guys aren’t the greatest practice team some times,” said Barrette. “But when the time comes to it and it’s time to [play], they’re ready to go. They were ready at practice yesterday and I’ll guarantee they’ll be ready [on Tuesday] for Wilbur Cross.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rest of the schedule</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday, February 7, Central travels to Lewis Mills for a CCC South clash at 7 p.m. and the contest against Windsor falls on Thursday, February 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the Rams finish out the stretch with games at Middletown (Tuesday, February 15), at Maloney (Friday, February 18) and then wrap up the regular season at Bristol Eastern (Monday, February 21 at 6 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams can keep its winning streak intact to the end of the campaign, the program will have won 35 straight games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one game at a time is the method the program prefers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Another scoring record ready to fall…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, records are made to be broken and that’s exactly what Clingan is doing - almost on a nightly basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dumping a school record 47 points against Platt on Monday, the 7-foot-2 giant has 359 points on the season (27.6 points-per-game) and 1,780 for his career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question is when will he tally the all-time scoring record at BCHS?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a remote possibility that Clingan, who needs 45 points to tie the program record held by Martin Huckaby (1,825 points), could accomplish that feat in New Haven on Wednesday against Cross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A close game would force Clingan to stay on the floor longer, seeing rare fourth period minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stay tuned as Donovan Clingan is on the cusp of capturing the all-time city record for scholastic points in both boys and girls within the next couple games.</p>
