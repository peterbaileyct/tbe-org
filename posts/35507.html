<p>Among the tens of hundreds of people who attended the one-year anniversary of the loss of two local police officers in a deadly shooting on Oct. 12, 2022, were two former classmates of late Sgt. Alex Hamzy, who shared what it meant for them to attend the vigil and how officer left an indelible mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I haven't seen him since we graduated, but he always held a special place in my heart, regardless," said Krystle Kozuch, who attended Bristol Eastern High School with Hamzy. "And him being on the police force, I just had to pay my respects."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solemn vigil with candle lights and brief comments from the police chief, mayor and sister of one of the officers was held on a closed off North Main Street in front of the police headquarters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About the vigil, Kozuch said, "It was very emotional, but it was heartfelt, it was heartfelt." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Bristol is a strong community," Kozuch added, "when something like this hits your hometown, especially a small community, everybody just comes out, and supports and is there for one another."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monique Stephens, who knew Hamzy since kindergarten when they were classmates, said she remembered playing sports and, well, just being himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"He was always smiling, always got a laugh, a joke," she said. "He was always happy is how we saw him. Never a dull moment with him." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police cars with their blue and red lights lit the street in front of City Hall, fire engines parked alongside them. At the opposite end of North Main Street, the American flag draped from one of the tower trucks streamed down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our town," Stephens said, "even though we are small we are big in number and heart, and we always come together no matter what."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Police Chief Brian Gould provided opening comments from a podium in front of the entrance to the police headquarters, standing between two large screens that displayed images of Hamzy and Lt. Dustin Demonte, which during the extended moment of silence following the speakers, flipped through picture from the lives of the late officers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"In the business of protecting and serving others," Gould said, "there is much uncertainty and much unpredictability, however there is one thing that is certain that is when danger presents, and others flee our finest bravest and most noble will drive to and through that danger with the objective of stopping evil in its tracks."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Lt. Dustin DeMonte, Sgt. Alex Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato embody exceptionalism. They are best of us and they set an example for the rest of us to follow," Gould said. "There is not doubt they loved and still love being Bristol police officers, always showing up day in and out with exceptionally positive attitudes, always smiling, laughing, bringing much joy and happiness to the Bristol Police Department and the community of Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"For that we have a tremendous amount of pride. It is our duty to never to forget, but more importantly to put these words into action. Never forget them, never forget their brothers and sisters, never forget each other most important, to never forget their families."</p>

<p>Hamzy and Demonte died after being ambushed on a police call. Iurato, who was also injured, was able to take down the shooter, saving responding officers from further assault. The shooter was armed with an automatic weapon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the week, it was announced that Iurato would be returning to active duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the extended moment of silence accompanied by music playing in the background, members of the crowd lit candles, turning to each other to assisting with the lighting of each candle. Others raised their phones, set to flashlight, and others brought electric ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeffery Caggiano in his brief address said, "This all-heart city has completed another trip around the sun as our hearts were broken just one year ago. Once again we have become bigger than our borders," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Top our Bristol Strong community, the outpouring of support, love and affection for our fallen officers has been incredible," he said. "It strengthens all of our hearts."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donna Hamzy Carroccia, sister of Alex, in her remarks extended thanks from her family to the members of the Bristol Police Department for their support, thanked Iurato for his actions on the night of the shooting and thanked the Bristol community for its response.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pastor Thomas Baran offered prayers before Gould asked for members of the audience to light candles and join in an extended moment of silence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the ceremony ended, most of the crowd exited North Main Street, some in silence, others turning to strangers, engaging them in soft conversations.</p>
