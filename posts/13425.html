<p>The Bristol American Legion baseball program is ready to begin the 2022 season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 will once again carry both Senior and Junior Legion programs, competing in Zone 1 once again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Age eligibility for play ranges between 14 to 19 years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between both programs, home games will be played from Riley Field and historic Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eighteen players will compose each squad and if the programs qualify, Bristol will have the ability to play in postseason tournaments.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be eligible for the team, potential players&nbsp;must register on the state web site at <a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fctlegionbball.com&amp;c=E,1,SD8bu82KC6MqCbqoo9CxH4-rp8-FEr7wVmFv09GQGdXEPv9De2hBtwXqRSUg--oqUMZq4IcamMIYa0ETFt4Gugys1Tmjbe3H6HR_gN7i85HPETI,&amp;typo=1&amp;ancr_add=1">ctlegionbball.com</a> and register by completing the F2 form.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Players will not be able to tryout for the Bristol programs without submitting the F2 form in advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tryouts commence on Saturday, May 28 at 11 a.m. from the baseball&nbsp; fields at Bristol Eastern High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A small fee will be required from each player that makes the final roster and must be paid in advance of any game played once the season starts, beginning in early June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once again, the Bristol program will be a multi-town squad, with players from Wolcott, Thomaston, Terryville, Farmington, Plainville and Bristol eligible to tryout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 1 this season will feature Senior American Legion teams from Meriden, Naugatuck, Newington, Simsbury, West Hartford, and the returning Torrington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avon, the 2021 CT State champions, will not be fielding a team this season but Zone 1 should be competitive as ever this coming summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team will play a minimum of 21 games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 will be playing its 94th season of American Legion baseball this year and is one of the most storied franchises in all the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 17U Junior program in Zone 1 will see Bristol returning along with Simsbury, Torrington, Meriden, and West Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
