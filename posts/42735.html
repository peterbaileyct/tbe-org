<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Drew with some brand-new Pokémon Go news for you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The World of Wonders event has spawned another event, the return of the Rouge of the Jungle! It starts Thursday, March 21 at 10 a.m. all the way through Monday, March 25 until 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event is a special event, which means you must purchase the Verdant Wonders ticket to get access to this exclusive event. The good news is that it’s only $8 and when you purchase it, you can have access to this event until it is completed! The benefit to this event is that it allows you to catch more Pokémon you wouldn’t be able to catch frequently, such as global variants of Flabébé. In the Americas, we can only get the yellow version of this Pokémon. With this event, you can get a red Flabébé native in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and blue Flabébé native in Asia.</p>

<p>With that being said, the raids are heating up! Last week, we had Primal Kyogre. This week and next week, we have Groudon and on Ester weekend, Shadow Mewtwo. Plenty of players met up at the Federal Green and took down Kyogre with ease. These spawns will be happening Saturday, March 23, between 2 p.m.  and 5 p.m. Make sure you have plenty of Raid Passes to have access to these battles. Here are the other locations to meet up for these raids:</p>

<p>Finally, Pokemon GO Fest is coming back! This year, the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow—the Gloomdweller Pokémon—is the star of the event! After making its Pokémon GO debut during the GO Fest 2024 events in Sendai and Madrid, this gloomy Pokémon will make an appearance in New York City! The NYC event is between July 5 and 7, while the global ticket event is the July 13 and 14.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
