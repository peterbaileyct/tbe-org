<p>Sun in the morning with more clouds in the afternoon. High around 75. What more could you ask for? That was a rhetorical question. Please don’t answer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">City Council meets tonight</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those with not much of a life, try the City Council meeting tonight. It is at 7 p.m., but if you want a seat, you need to get there at around 5 p.m. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The highlight of the meeting is when the mayor shows a slide presentation from his Facebook pages. (All 483 of them.)</p>

<p>The agenda is a real page-turner this month. Take a look. <a href="https://bristolct.portal.civicclerk.com/event/855/files/agenda/3859">https://bristolct.portal.civicclerk.com/event/855/files/agenda/3859</a></p>

The proposed site will be coming at 454 Farmington Ave Bristol CT. There are former residential properties at 454 Farmington Ave Bristol CT which will be removed to make way for the restaurant.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
