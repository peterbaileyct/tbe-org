<p>BRISTOL - This week’s crosstown city series wrestling battle, pitting two very good programs, was a tremendous bout as Bristol Eastern just snuck by Bristol Central over a 45-34 final from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The contest saw the Lancers rack up several pins which included Alex Marshall, Eastern’s latest 100-win grappler, picking up a pin-fall victory against Jack Jones at 160 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Will Hamilton (126), a beast on the mats, earned his win against the Lancers via forfeit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was the significance in Eastern’s 11-point win over Central?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It finally squared the series between the squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The series, which was started in 1963, now stands at BE-29: BC-28: 2 ties after fifty-nine matches against one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is currently on an 11-match winning streak over Central and the most recent showdown was as close as close could be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last time the bout went down to the wire was back in 2013 when the Lancers upended the Rams by a 36-35 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won in 2009 and 2010 by a combined seven points over two tremendous meets but Eastern was about to take over the series - at least for a time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, Central has beaten Eastern by a close margin over the years as the Rams have won the city series match nine times by three points or less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a tremendous accomplishment by the program up on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On average, Eastern scores 31.5 points-per-match against Central in city series action while the Rams post 26.5 points against the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central coach Matt Boissonneault and his counterpart over at Eastern, Eric Sassu, have both programs humming this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern was the runner-up in the CCC South, going 5-1 in the league and 14-4 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central was right there as well, posting a sterling 10-3 ledger overall (4-2 CCC South).</p>
