<h3>The following is a press release from Bristol Health.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may surprise many people to learn that 25 percent of those who&nbsp;die every year in the U.S. are veterans. To help provide care and support that reflect the important contributions made by these men and women, Bristol Health Home Care &amp; Hospice has become a national partner of&nbsp;<strong><em>We Honor Veterans</em></strong>, a pioneering campaign developed by National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a&nbsp;<strong><em>We Honor Veterans</em></strong>&nbsp;Partner, Bristol Health’s home care and hospice agency will implement ongoing&nbsp;veteran-centered education for their staff and volunteers to help improve the care they provide to the Veterans they proudly serve. &nbsp;The nation is seeing&nbsp;many of the veterans who served in World War II and Korea pass away&nbsp;—&nbsp;and the number of deaths of Vietnam veterans is beginning to rise&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>“Our veterans have given so much to all of us. We owe them such a debt of gratitude as they protect our freedoms each and every day. It’s important that we are there for them each and every day as well, and that includes providing them with proper end-of-life care,” said&nbsp;CarenChalfant, administrator of Bristol Health Home Care &amp; Hospice. “By partnering with <strong>We Honor Veterans</strong> we are recognizing the unique needs of our veterans who are facing a life-limiting illness and&nbsp;we will be better able to accompany and guide&nbsp;veterans and their families toward a more peaceful ending.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>We Honor Veterans</em></strong>&nbsp;campaign provides tiered recognition to organizations that demonstrate a systematic commitment to improving care for veterans. “Partners” can&nbsp;assess their ability to serve veterans and, using resources provided as part of the campaign, integrate best practices for&nbsp;providing end-of-life care to veterans into their organization. And in cases where there might be some specific needs related to the veteran’s&nbsp;military service, combat experience or other traumatic events, Bristol&nbsp;Health Home Care &amp;&nbsp;Hospice will find tools to help support those they are caring for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We thank Bristol&nbsp;Health Home Care &amp;&nbsp;Hospice for partnering in the We Honor Veterans program,” says NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo&nbsp;Banach. “We Honor Veterans partners are&nbsp;committed to providing quality veteran-centric care to the veteran patients they serve. They understand how a veteran’s military service, combat experience or other traumatic events, could impact their end-of-life experience.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The resources of&nbsp;<strong><em>We Honor Veterans</em></strong>&nbsp;focus on respectful inquiry, compassionate listening, and grateful acknowledgment, coupled with veteran-centric education of health care&nbsp;staff caring for veterans.
