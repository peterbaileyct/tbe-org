<p>Among those who joined World War II Iwo Jima survivor Joe Caminiti at the Bristol Public Library for a special viewing of Caminiti's portrait was John Lodovico, a Vietnam War veteran who was able to get to the viewing during his lunch hour, according to Neal Supranovich, Post 2 historian who sent along the information with some photos of other locations where prints of the portrait also are on display.</p>

<p>Lodovico, who is a member of local American Legion Post 2, donated the funds to have the portrait framed, Supranovich said. He came out during his lunch hour so that he could be there for the viewing. Caminiti prefers not to drive later in the day, so noon was the agreed upon time for the viewing.</p>

<p>Caminiti's portrait, one in a series by artist Don Scott celebrating the last living World War II veterans, will hang permanently in the History Room at the Bristol Public Library alongside a photo of the late Ed Riccio another World War II veteran from Bristol.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
