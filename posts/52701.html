<p>Turnout was heavy Monday morning in the first hours of early voting in Connecticut, as a surprised Gov. Ned Lamont discovered when he arrived at Greenwich town hall to cast a ballot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think I’m going to vote another day. There’s a half-hour line here, which I appreciate. People are taking their votes seriously,” Lamont said. Peering at the line, he smiled and added, “I think it’s popular.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similar scenes played out across Connecticut on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/10/16/ct-early-voting-2024/">first of 14 days of early voting</a>, which ends on Nov. 3. Early voting hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except for extended voting from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Oct. 29 and 31.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Greenwich, registrars said there was simple math behind the wait that reached to 50 minutes: It takes about one minute to check in voters, and there were at least 50 lined up before voting began at 10 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant the day began with a 50-minute backlog, said Fred DeCaro III, the Republican registrar. Voters cast 126 votes in the first 90 minutes, indicating that the check-in time got quicker, DeCaro said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We knew there was going to be enthusiasm,” DeCaro said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Democratic registrar, Mary Hegarty, said, “I think it demonstrates people like the idea.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Hegarty, Lamont said he saw the lines as more promising than problematic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s working, isn’t it? People like it. They enjoy it. It’s flexible. It’s convenient,” Lamont said. “I think there’s a competition. The Democrats and the Republicans want their people to vote early, so it looks like momentum.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, and Tina Courpas, a Republican candidate for the 149th House District, greeted voters as they arrived — and some as they left without voting, promising to return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today, it looks like the lines are way too long to vote,” Fazio said. “But I hope the next 13 days will be more reasonable waits for people. We’ll see how this goes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fazio was one of the five Republicans in the Senate to vote for the law implementing early voting. The other seven were opposed. No Democrat voted against the measure in the Senate or House.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are encouraging our voters to vote early and bank their vote,” Fazio said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fazio estimated that 20% of voters in Greenwich will already have cast their votes before Election Day on Nov. 5, when polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It definitely means the campaigns end early, in a sense,” Fazio said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of voting Monday, Lamont walked the long line inside town hall to thank them for turning out, regardless of their affiliation. He did no electioneering, saying nothing about who was on the ballot. Or that&nbsp;<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/10/20/walz-fundraiser-greenwich/">he had hosted the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz</a>, at his home the previous night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamont shook hands as he walked the line, posing for a photo when asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One man folded his arms, signaling a handshake was unwelcome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m a Republican,” the man said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamont smiled and said, “That’s OK.”</p>
