<p>Singing, dancing and a dramatic reading of Gen. Order No. 3 marked the Juneteenth celebration this past Wednesday at the Carousel Museum, filling the second-floor event space to capacity.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>'The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free," the voice of the leader of Nzinga's Daughters rang out in the hall decorated with bright reds, yellows, whites and greens against a black background proclaiming. "Happy Juneteenth."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In call and response fashion, others from the touring group sang out, "The people of Texas are informed ..." until the entire proclamation was read. The original reading was on June 19, 1865, by U.S. Major Gen. Gordon Granger.</p>

<p>Juneteenth became an official federal holiday, when President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law on June 17, 2021. This is the second year that the Juneteenth celebration was held at the Carousel Museum.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
