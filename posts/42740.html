<p>BRISTOL â€” American Legion Post 209 invites families to come out and make "good memories" at its 9th annual Youth Fishing Derby Sunday, April 28 at Rockwell Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The free event, provided by American Legion Post 209 for youths 16 and under, will begin with registration from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m., followed by the tournament from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Each participant can catch up to two trout and a food truck, Steve Top Dogs, will provide breakfast.</p>

<p>Brian Avery, commander of American Legion Post 209, said the annual event is offered each year to provide families with the opportunity to spend quality time together.</p>

<p>"It's about making memories that will last a lifetime -- something that you can pass onto the next generation," Avery said. "We think that is something that's very important. It's a chance to get away from the computers and forget about your bills and the everyday stresses of life. We're hoping for a sunny, beautiful day."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In past years, Avery said, as many as 135 children participated.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trophies and prizes, donated by sponsors, will be awarded. These will also include plaques and fishing poles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first boy and girl to catch a fish, the first boy and girl to limit out, the first four people to catch a golden trout, and the next 10 to limit out will receive prizes. Prizes will also be awarded for the two biggest fish caught and special prizes will go to those who catch five tagged fish.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avery encouraged people to donate to the derby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The fishing derby is run thanks to the generous donations of individuals, organizations and businesses in Bristol and surrounding towns," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avery also encouraged families to bring their children to Rockwell Park April 26 at 7 p.m. to watch as the pond is stocked with fish for the event. Fish will range from 2 pounds to as big as 10 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our goal is to put 300 fish in the pond," he said. "We want to focus on having quality fish. Years later, kids will be able to look back and say 'remember when I caught the big fish?' That's what we want for kids."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>American Legion Post 209 will also have a banner set up where kids can take photos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No treble hooks of any size are allowed. Minnows, meal worms, worms or power bait are allowed. Free worms and meal worms will be donated by Tal's Tackle.</p>
