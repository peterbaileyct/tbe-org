<p>BRISTOL - The collision course between the two boys public school track programs in Bristol is less than two weeks away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both programs have continued to post victories, making that city series showdown on May 16 looking like the winner of the meet would be in position to win the CCC South Championship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams held their end of the bargain, securing an 89.5-60.5 victory over Plainville in Bristol on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central won two of the three relays against Plainville and about everything else that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the&nbsp;4x400 relay challenge, the combination of Rowan Hennessey, Patrick Wininger, Aiden Georgakopoulos, and Julian Lopez took first place in 3:43 while in the challenging 4x800 relay, the grouping of Aiden Lopez, Frankie Porrini, Chris Roy, Wininger won in 8:42.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, Rowan Hennessey took the 400 meters in 56.0 seconds flat while Porrini earned a hat trick in the 800, 1600, and 3200 meter showdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini, who tallied four first place finishes that day, won the 800 in 2:06.1, took first in the mile event with an outstanding finish of 4:38 and then in the 3200, he was all alone when he crossed the finish line in 10:22.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Logan Jackson won the 300 hurdles in 42.8 seconds and then Tre Blair was a dual winner in the jumping events.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The high jump saw Blair finish in first place via a successful make at five feet, 10 inches and then in the long jump, Blair posted the win with a 19 foot, 11 inch finish.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Anthony Paulino’s triple jump leap of 41 feet, six inches was the winning mark of the event while in the pole vault challenge,Jude Browning cleared 10 feet, six inches for the win.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Tashawn Cauley (37 feet even) won the shot put and, in the discus, Aengus Repeta chucked it 109 feet, one inch to tally another first place win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central program will attempt to keep its undefeated streak on the line next Tuesday in a clash at Lewis Mills High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meet time is 3:45 p.m. in Burlington and if the Rams stay perfect, and if Eastern does the same the following week at Berlin, the BC/BE meet is going to have even more on the line than just the usual typical bragging rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blair making more history</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Saturday’s Middletown Invitational, Blair had one heck of a day in the pit again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair won the triple jump at the event, hitting a mark of 46 feet, 1.25 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paulino came in fifth at the event with a leap of 40 feet, nine inches.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair also won the long jump event with a make of 21 feet, 11 inches for the winning tally.&nbsp;</p>
