<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition has been reporting Bristol news now for approximately four years. We have covered all the news we can, both good and bad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> We have also strived to be fair with all the subjects we have covered, whether it be in politics, sports, entertainment, community activities, or any topic that has come to our attention. As our base of readers grows, as it has done from one year to the next, we are becoming the eyes and ears for many Bristol citizens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the things that has been very helpful to our efforts has been the gracious cooperation of all the people and organizations that we have covered in the past four years. We contact people to ask for information or a comment, and they give us the information that we need. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or if some feel that they cannot comment, they explain the reasons why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That is why it is so puzzling to us that the Mayor of Bristol has made it his practice to not offer a reply to any request we have made of him. He doesn't respond that he can't comment. He just ignores us altogether.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>here we can list times he failed to cooperate</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So we have a question for Mayor Caggiano- <strong><em>why don't you respond?</em></strong> Have we hurt your feelings? Have we libeled or slandered you in some way? Have printed false stories about you or your political party?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
