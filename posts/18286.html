<p>Ken Krawiec was playing tennis with some friends Wednesday night at Page Park, when he heard a sudden burst of gunfire.</p>

<p>"The shots came quickly, pop ,pop, pop, about twelve in a row," said Krawiec. Then there was a pause of 10 to 15 seconds and another burst of gunfire erupted, another 10-12 shots.</p>

<p>The next thing Krawiec heard was the sound of sirens everywhere. He said he got in his car and followed the parade of emergency vehicles heading to Redstone Hill Road. As he drove down Middle Street, he came to the ESPN North Campus.</p>

<p>In the parking lot, there already appeared to be around 20 police cars, he said, with officers everywhere. He got as close as the intersection of Metro Street and Redstone Hill Road, and from there everything was blocked off. While he was watching, the State Police Crime Lab van arrived.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
