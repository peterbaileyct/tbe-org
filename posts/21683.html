<p>Nick was born on April 2, 1941, in Bristol and was the son of the late Dominick and Norma (Burgar) Ferro. He graduated from E.C. Goodwin Technical High School and served in the United States Navy before entering the plumbing trade. He would eventually go on to become an owner of The Shaffer Co. in Bristol.  </p>

<p>A stand-up guy, you could be sure with just a handshake and a look in the eye he was a man of his word. Nick enjoyed golfing, tending to his gardens and looked forward to his Wednesday night cards with the boys. For 45+ years he loved vacationing and making memories in Wildwood, N.J., with his family and close friends, the Positano’s. Some people may remember him as Santa Claus, as he handed out red balloons during the Bristol children’s holiday parade each year.</p>
