<p>Jean Jones Billington, age 84, of Bristol, died at her home on Good Friday, April 15, surrounded by her loving family. She was born in Forestville on August 14, 1937 to the late Harold and Rita (Smith) Jones. A lifelong resident of Bristol, she attended local schools and worked at Pratt &amp; Whitney for 35 years prior to retiring. As a young woman, she worked tirelessly to raise her family, and she continued to dedicate herself to her daughters and granddaughters for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>Jean was known for her energy and work ethic, as well as for her sense of humor and devotion to her family. She was proud to keep her house spotless and always ready to use her boundless energy to care for her family, whether by working multiple jobs while raising her two daughters, taking care of small grandchildren, offering her car and her patience to teach teenaged granddaughters to drive, or showering her great-grandkids with attention and gifts. While Jean would be the first to admit cooking was not her greatest passion, her family always looked forward to a rare Thanksgiving or Christmas appearance of Gram’s coffee cake, Italian wedding soup, ambrosia salad, or her delicious baked beans in their brown pot. In addition to spending time with her family, she enjoyed traveling to Cape Cod and Florida, dancing and taking trips to the casino with her longtime companion Anthony Ranco, who predeceased her in December 2018.</p>
