<p>WALLINGFORD - The Bristol Greeners had some very good performances over the 2022 campaign, battling the best that the Greater Hartford Twilight Baseball League had to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Greeners finished 5-20 overall but fared much better than its final ledger indicated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol lost four games by a single run and had several other teams on the ropes during regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Greeners had a few players who were among the statistical league leaders this past summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A.J. Lorenzetti, the former coach of the Bristol program, belted out 23 hits, tied for fourth in the GHTBL, and scooped up two doubles along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 22 games, he batted a slick .333 to go along with nine runs scored and team-leading 11 RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lorenzetti also spent some time on the hill - going 1-1 over 16 innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was Kenny Knox, the outstanding pitcher who threw in multiple leagues this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knox pitched for the Greeners and the Southington Aftershock of the Connecticut Twilight League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But for the Greeners, the chucker was in the top five in GHTBL play which included games started (nine), strikeouts (68), complete games (four) and walks (29).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knox started every game he played, went 2-6 overall (in 55 innings) while carrying an ERA of 3.82 in the regular season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the plate, he batted .250 with seven hits and two RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly seemingly found his way on base in several games, drawing 10 walks, and managed to swipe seven bases along the way - another top-five total.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He carried a solid .311 on-base percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 20 games, Jon Pierce notched 20 hits and batted an outstanding .303 with seven RBI while Noah Hickey and Nick Swancott each had a .375 batting average over limited action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Felix Gutierrez played in 23 games, tallying 22 hits and seven RBI while batting .272 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trevor Nohilly and Connor Tyrian each played inn over 20 games for the Greeners this season while veterans Keegan Bartis, Stephen Warkoski, Casey Horjus, and Trevor Mays all had productive stints in a Bristol uniform. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even Jerry LaPenta made an appearance for the program while former Plainville High School standout Mike Munson suited up for the team over a few games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He batted .364 with three doubles, three RBI, and earned a couple walks along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s just a lot of guys that really love baseball,” said Mays of the Greeners. “They love coming out every night. I really like the competitive nature of the league.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays, the coach of the Greeners, did a credible job in his first stint as coach of the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the plan is for the Greeners to return to GTHBL play in 2023 and make a real run at the top teams in the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we do stay in this league, which I think we probably will, I think we can be more competitive,” said Mays. “At least me personally, I’ve learned a lot about the league and what it takes specifically, what pieces we need to add, and change up to be successful.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And hopefully, I’ll be able to throw as well.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays, a quality arm for the Greeners, had his season cut short via an injury which occurred during the first week of June.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In just over 10 innings of work, Mays carried an ERA of 3.47 - allowing just 12 hits while walking only two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mays is scheduled for Tommy John surgery in September.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s expecting a period of 12 months for surgery and recouperation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His loss was keenly felt by the program, but Mays is hoping for a return to play some time in 2023.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I tore up my UCL (ulnar collateral ligament) in my elbow,” said Mays. “It kind of hurt our pitching staff a little bit.”</p>
