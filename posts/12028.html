<p>There’s no easy road to a scholastic state championship in basketball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter the talent level, no matter the venue, there’s always a chance for an opponent to sneak off with a win against a top-ranked squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, two different boys basketball programs from Bristol Central never had that upset bid come their way as the teams in 1989-90 and 2021-22 went undefeated – moving onto state title jaunts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams of 1989-90 won their championship against St. Joseph in the final seconds, squaring up an amazing 66-65 victory from Central Connecticut State University while the current squad spun Northwest Catholic, 56-36, to tally the program’s second ever championship in Uncasville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that 2021 squad could be considered uncrowned champs because the team – due to the pandemic – never was able to go after a title but went a sterling 15-0 and won the CCC Tournament title against three top-five ranked teams in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the two programs that did win it all from Central had to battle all the elements with that invisible bullseye on their backs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And both squads from Bristol could have been knocked off in the semifinal round of their respective runs to the championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past season, the Rams needed overtime in its 54-52 triumph against Wilton back on March 15.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that crew from 1990, with the likes of Malcolm Huckaby, Lonnie Brooks, and Rod Hickey on the court, was pushed in its semifinal showdown as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on March 14, 1990, the top-ranked Rams had their hands full against No. 12 Warren Harding in a Class semifinal from Quinnipiac College.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That contest was a war as Harding refused to go quietly into the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams never trailed in the showdown but led just 37-31 at the half and had to fend off Harding over thirty-two long minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central enjoyed a large double-figure advantage, leading by 18 in the closing moments of the third period but off a late hoop, Harding was down just four points with 2:30 to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams hung on to win in the end – getting to its second ever state championship game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooks scored 24 points in the win while Huckaby added 23 points, 12 boards, and 12 assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hickey nabbed a double-double of 15 points and 14 rebounds, Greg Fradette scored nine, and Duane Salgado added six to the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fast forward to 2022 and that Wilton game was no picnic either in an over-physical affair from the Floyd Little Athletic Center in New Haven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wilton led by four points midway through the second period but saw that advantage evaporate as a 20-4 burst, capped by a lay-up from Victor Rosa, saw Central holding a 32-20 edge with 3:13 remaining in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Wilton ended regulation with a 25-13 run and was one completed four-point play away from snaring the edge away from Central late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The go-ahead charity shot was missed, overtime quickly commenced, and nine free throws later, Central was headed to the Mohegan Sun Arena via the two-point win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If life was easy, it wouldn’t be this fun.</p>
