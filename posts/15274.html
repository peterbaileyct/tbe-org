<p>The campaign for the Bristol Blues has been on the money this year as the squad boasts the second best record in the New England Collegiate Baseball League.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season’s 13-29 ledger is far away in the rearview mirror because the Blues -- through 39 games, already doubled that win total this season as of Saturday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 28-11, the locals have already wrapped up the Western Division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as stated every week in TBE, no other program in the West has a winning record as the Danbury Westerners are 17-20 -- 10 games out of first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Vermont Mountaineers (30-10) have the best ledger in all the NECBL -- leasing the North Division by 11 games -- while Costal Division leader Newport (27-13) is in a battle against Marthas Vineyard (25-14) for first placer and is the only league in the NECBL that does not have a division winner as of yet.</p>

<h3>The Week That Was</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues had five games this past week, with varying results, but none of the teams of the Western Division could put a dent in Bristol’s first place cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the results from those contests as the Blues are about to wrap up the regular season in NECBL play:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay Harry (3-for-4, two runs, three RBI) racked up two double while Derek Tenney (2-for-6, five RBI) smashed out a home run to lead the Blues.</p>

<p>*Trailing by a run, Bristol scored three straight to knockoff the Nighthawks by two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Player of the Week</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, a talented Bristol player earned a little in-season NECBL recognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Derek Tenney, who was simply on a tear, earned Player of the Week for the week ending July 18.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney posted a league-high .733 batting average with 11 hits in 15 at-bats over five games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scooped in 11 RBIs, the second most in the league over the past week, while smashing out a home run, two doubles, scored five runs, walked twice, and stole two bases over a very busy slate of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The highlight of his week came on July 16 against North Adams, going 3-for-4 with a double and two RBIs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney then laced out a three-hit performance against the Mountaineers the day before, going 4-for-4 with seven RBI -- tallying the home run -- versus North Adams on July 14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 28 games this season, the first baseman is third on the Blues in batting average this season -- roping up a .289 tally with 24 hits and 16 runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His 24 RBI, 12 walks, and two home runs is a small sampling of the season he has put together for the Blues this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tenney is the first NECBL Weekly Honor Roll winner for Bristol this season.</p>
