<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Central Invitational is always a great gauge for every scholastic grappler to see where they’re at towards the midpoint of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this year’s event did not disappoint as several programs from all over the state hit the mats in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time around, East Hartford - ranked fourth in the state according to most recent Connecticut Wrestling Online’s top 10 poll - took the invite behind a strong 219.5 point showing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Milford, currently sixth in the poll, was the runner up with 166 points while Staples (141 points) was a bit behind for third place.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Eastern’s outstanding program collected 132 points while CCC challenger Avon (122.5) was nearly 10 points behind.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the local front, Plainville (109 points) nabbed eight place and host Bristol Central (104.5) ended up in ninth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three grapplers from the Mum City made it all the way to the finals of the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 157 pounds, Central’s Lincoln Archibald earned the win at 157 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior grappler battled Ian Karlin from the Pomperaug co-op for the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Needing just one period to decide the bout, Archibald took the pin-fall victory in just 1:35.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big time win for the surging Archibald.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol had two other grapplers earn runner-up awards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 106 pounds, Middletown’s Isaiah McDaniel picked up a technical fall decision against Eastern’s Yussuf Bah (16-1).</p>

<p>The 138 match saw Eastern’s Gabriel White defeated Pomperaug’s Stephen Kovaleski via 8-4 decision for third place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other third place victory came at 215 pounds and that meant Eastern’s Rio Fernandez was in action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernandez earned a pin-fall win towards the tail-end of the second period, earning the ‘W’ in 3:54 over New Milford’s Christopher Reiss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the other third place title bouts, Central’s Kaden Dragon (120 pounds) was pinned by Enfield’s Marlon Andino while at 132, Joseph Nick fell by 8-4 decision to New Milford’s Tyler Roussel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern also saw action in consolation matches as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enfield’s Jacob Beiler (175) nabbed an 8-0 decision over Owen Broyles and at 190, Tim Mrachek from Berlin won over the Lancers’ Aidyn Davies - winning the match in 2:40 off a pin-fall triumph.<br>Finally, in fifth place matches, two Bristol wrestlers came away with wins.<br>Central’s Alex Lamarre (126 pounds) pinned New Milford’s Matthew Alfano in under a minute (58 seconds) and in a heavyweight entanglement, Eastern’s Nuon Sovannara was a fifth place victor as well.</p>
