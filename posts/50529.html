<p>“We’re excited to announce we’ve been approved to reopen tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 3rd!” he wrote. “Thank you everyone for the ongoing support, kind words, and donations during this tough time. We’re on the road to rebuild and can’t wait for the restaurant to be repaired.”</p>

<p>The recent accident on Aug. 19, marked the second time in two years that a vehicle has collided with Jimmy's On The River. To assist with the financial burden, Christina Driscoll, daughter of owner Jim Driscoll, launched a GoFundMe campaign. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Your contributions will help Jimmy's On The River cover the costs of repairs and ensure that the restaurant can continue to serve the community and provide for the hardworking team," she stated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The campaign has been met with a positive response, raising $22,372 as of Sept. 6, from 96 donors. In her GoFundMe message, Driscoll expressed her gratitude to the community. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank you so much for your support, thoughts, and generosity during this difficult time. Your help means the world to us,” she wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Located at&nbsp;249 Terryville Rd, Jimmy’s On The River is open Monday-Saturday from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
