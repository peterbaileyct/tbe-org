<p>BURLINGTON - The Lewis Mills girls soccer team jumped all over Bristol Eastern on Thursday afternoon as the Spartans scooped up a big 5-0 win over the Lancers in Burlington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The combination of Lily Castle and Abby Jankoski collected a total of four scores - two goals apiece - while teammate Leah Mischke splashed in the other goal for the Spartans.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match was the first for both programs in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Eastern head coach Scott Redman, “Mills came out firing on all cylinders” and netted its first goal off a beautiful corner that Jankoski headed into the back of the net to make it a 1-0 contest just 13 minutes in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was no turning back after that as Mills nabbed a 4-0 halftime push and finished with the 5-0 victory.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Lewis Mills controlled most of the possession and game,” said Redman. “The Lancers responded with some improved energy and effort in the second half and created a couple nice chances from Kate Patterson and Meg Krok but both just slid wide.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern keeper Abigale Pelletier was under fire all afternoon long.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She took away multiple opportunities from the Spartans, etching up 11 saves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Burlington’s Kayleigh Smith made a lone save for Mills in the shutout victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the loss, the Lancers will be home for three straight matches from Alumni Field on King Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berlin comes to town on Tuesday, followed by a visit from Tolland on Thursday, and on Tuesday, September 20, Eastern battles CCC Interdivisional competitor Northwest Catholic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All three matches are slated for 6 p.m. - under the lights at BEHS.</p>
