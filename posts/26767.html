<p>BRISTOL –&nbsp;Wednesday proved to be the final game of the season for the Bristol Eastern baseball team, falling to Wethersfield by a 5-1 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles improved to 10-10 overall during a rain-soaked six innings while the Lancers ended things at 6-14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern managed six hits off Wethersfield pitcher Max Hoon but couldn't cobble together much offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hoon tallied just one strikeout but went the distance, throwing only 61 pitches over his six innings of work.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overcoming a midseason shoulder injury, Eastern's&nbsp;Mike Roalf earned the start on the mound - seeing his first assignment in over three weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield scored three runs in the top of the first on just one hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away in the first, Roalf issued two walks to put a couple runners on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Multiple stolen bases put the runners on second and third bases and a single to center by Justin Bagdasarian scored the lead runner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A double error on the relay throw in from the outfield allowed a second run to score and Bagdasarian later scored when Jack Tenney's fly ball to the outfield was dropped, making it a 3-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern's Declan Schenck relieved Roalf to start the third tilt, pitching four strong innings in relief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed just two hits, one run, fanned seven, and did not issue a free pass over another solid showing out of the bullpen.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth frame, Wethersfield's&nbsp;Ethan Lemos dropped in a single, stole second and third, and scored when the throw to third base was misplayed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored its lone run in the fifth inning as Jed Sutula&nbsp;got on base via an infield error.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went to second on a groundout and scored on Mason Harris' two out single to right, chopping the deficit to 5-1.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the rain came at 5:30 and the game was called about twenty minutes later, ending the Lancers season with its four-run setback to the Eagles.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES...</strong>The game was the final scholastic contest for the Eastern senior core of Jose Felicano, Kyle Babin, Mike Roalf, Connor Cyr, Jed Sutula, Isaac Roberge, Cooper Porrini and Ryan Maglio.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
