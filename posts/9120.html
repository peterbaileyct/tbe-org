<p>MANCHESTER - Bristol Central’s Frankie Porrini raced the best of the best at the 2021 CIAC Boys Cross Country Open event on Friday, November 5 from Wickham Park in Manchester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended up placing 58th overall with a time of 17:14 - ending the season with an impressive time and finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The race was highlighted by the Sherry Brothers, Gavin and Callum, from Conard high school as the duo placed 1-2 in a time under 15:30 for the 3.1 mile curse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gavin won the race in 15:16 while Callum was 6 seconds behind (15:22).</p>

<p>But Porrini, the top runner in the Mum City this year, was in the thick of things until the end as just over a half-dozen racers finished less than 10 seconds in front of Porrini’s excellent time.</p>
