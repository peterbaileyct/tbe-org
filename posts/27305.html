<p>Dozens of Bristol residents wearing smiles and carrying paddles gathered at Seymour Park on Monday for the grand opening of the new dedicated pickleball facility. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in America for the third year running. It attracts players of all ages because it’s easy to learn and fun to play,” said superintendent of Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Joshua Medeiros at the grand opening ceremony featuring a ribbon cutting. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immediately following the ceremony, eager players of all ages and abilities took to the pickleball courts for a game. The large and lively crowd took turns playing on one of the eight new courts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new pickleball courts have replaced the dilapidated tennis courts that were previously in Seymour Park on Shrub Road. The newly unveiled facility has been highly anticipated by Bristol residents, especially senior members of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’ve been playing basically for four years; that’s how long that I’ve known what pickleball actually is,” said Bristol resident Michael Pletscher. “My wife brought me; said ‘Get out of the house’ after I retired; ‘Find something to do; let’s go down and play pickleball.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Right now, the majority of players we have are seniors,” added Pletscher. “Hopefully, there’s a lot more people going to be involved in pickleball, especially with facilities like these.“</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pickleball is an easy-to-pick-up sport that incorporates elements of badminton, ping pong and tennis. The game can be played indoors or outdoors on a court about a third of the size of a tennis court. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mayor Jeffrey Caggiano, who lives in the neighborhood near Seymour Park, invited Bristol pickleball enthusiasts to play a friendly game with him. The mayor added that he was excited to use the facilities as part of his workout routine. </p>

<p>“I got into this sport by my oldest son, who's 27 years old, who came back from New York City and brought paddles,” said Caggiano. “I've played at Page Park and Peck with the lines and the higher nets, so I can't wait to play here today.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pickleball has become an extremely popular sport throughout the United States, which has approximately 4.8 million players. The sport has experienced a huge uptick in popularity over the past three years from those looking for pandemic-friendly activities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We get to get people out recreating outside where they're safer from communicable diseases,” said Caggiano, “and where they get out moving and get healthy.” </p>

<p>A popular Co-Ed Adult Pickleball program is currently offered through the Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services department. Residents who partake in the social sport can expect to see more pickleball around Mum City in the next couple of years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“More courts are coming,” said Medeiros. “In 2024, we are poised to break ground on four additional lighted pickleball courts at Page Park as part of the Page Park revitalization process.”</p>
