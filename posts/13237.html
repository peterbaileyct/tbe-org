<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Wonder of Women Event</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past week, the Women &amp; Girls Fund at Main Street Community Foundation held their annual Wonder of Women (WOW) event. While all money raised benefits local women and girls, a special collection was initiated during the event this year to assist Ukrainian women and children. Over $5,100 was raised, and all money will be donated to the Polish American Foundation of Connecticut in New Britain, which has volunteers in Poland assisting Ukrainian women and children who have fled their homes and are<br>settling in Poland. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The WOW event is an annual event whose proceeds support grants for programs that make it possible for women and girls in Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington, and Wolcott to improve the conditions and opportunities in their lives. Over the past 21 years, the Women &amp; Girls Fund has awarded over $668,000 in grants and immediate response funds.<br></p>

<p>Over the past seven days, the CDC reported that Connecticut's positivity rate registered 13.71 percent. The CDC advises that residents living in the high/orange categories – which include Hartford, Litchfield, Middlesex, New Haven, Tolland, and Windham Counties – should wear a mask indoors in public, stay up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccines, and get tested if they have symptoms. Additional precautions may be needed for residents who are at high risk for severe illness.</p>
