<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bristol Parks System to pilot program to encourage the growth of natural habitats</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Board of Park Commissioners in conjunction with the Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services Department (BPRYCS) will be piloting a program that reduces the amount of times different sections of Page Park are mowed in a year to encourage native habitat restoration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The national ‘Low Mow” program has been adopted by municipalities and campuses including New Milford, Conn., Greenbay, Wisc., and Iowa State University. Its ecological benefits include enhanced habitat for native species of plants and animals, improved hydrology, and the reduction of carbon emissions linked to mowing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Areas identified as part of the Low Mow pilot program at Page Park include the Moody Street entrance, the sledding hill adjacent to Page Pool, the Woodland Street bank, and areas of the old Orchard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not only does the program have a number of ecological benefits," said Robert Fiorito, vice-chair of the Board of Park Commissioners in a press release announcing the program, "but it also creates cost savings and efficiencies for BPRYCS, allowing the department to focus on more active recreational areas.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The designated 3.6 acres will be mowed once a year in late fall. Throughout the growing season, borders and trails will continued to be mowed to encourage park visitors to interact with the restored habitat. Signs will be installed near the Low Mow areas to inform the public on this initiative.</p>
