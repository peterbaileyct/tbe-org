<p>A classic family-oriented farm and nature festival, The Fall Family Festival at Indian Rock Nature Preserve, returns for its fifth year this Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The weather is looking great for Saturday, so we really look forward to seeing familiar and new faces. It's a fun-filled day,” said Lauren Prior, the Nature Preserve’s volunteer coordinator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The animal barns are open for visitation, there’s hay rides, pumpkin picking, apple cider making and themed activities throughout the whole preserve,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the Family Fall Festival began in 2018 it has seen up to 1,000 visitors when the weather cooperates, she added as she raked the last bunch of leaves onto a large pile near the outline for the hayride queue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Playing in our large leaf pile is definitely a favorite for kids,” she said. The leaf pile, corn hole and photo stands are a few in a collection of lawn games in front of the main barn at the festival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It's not just a fall festival, it’s an educational experience. We want families to bond with nature and learn a little bit too.” said Fern Vaughn the festival coordinator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vaughn is also the program coordinator for the organization’s Barnes Nature Center on Shrub Road. She oversees engaging visitors in nature-based activities. (Her son, Tom, runs the pewter smith activity at the festival, too.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We also like to educate people not just on the farm, but with our two Native American wigwams,” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thatched domed huts, traditional to some North American Tribal peoples, are the first stop on the festival’s popular scenic hayride that brings attendees on a 20-minute ride around the lake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Activities at the wigwams include storytelling and traditional corn husk doll making.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The wigwams are a way to teach about the indigenous people that lived here and hunted on the property,” Vaughn said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indian Rock Nature Preserve is on the 280 acres of ancestral lands utilized by the Tunxis people, a tribe of First Americans the original land stewards that frequented this land to hunt and gather resources.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The preserve is named after Indian Rock, a historic rock formation purportedly used as shelter by the tribe and early colonial settlers as they traveled the hunting trail which is now Route 69.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kaitlyn White, operations assistant, said “My favorite part about the Fall Family Festival is watching families and friends appreciate the outdoors and fall festivities, it's going to be such a&nbsp; great day -- full of fun!” she said as she was cajoled Tom the Turkey with raspberries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
