<p>This past week the Bristol’s Economic &amp; Community Development Commission (ECD) in conjunction with the Downtown subgroup (tasked with overseeing Centre Square) made simple but meaningful modifications to the development plan put forth by the ECD and Wheeler Clinic for the construction of Wheeler’s corporate headquarters. The plan was approved by a bi-partisan unanimous vote of the ECD. This included city councilor Sebastian Panioto who now serves as the council liaison to the ECD.</p>

<p>As one would expect, a strong plan such as the Wheeler project also has the support of Mayor Caggiano. Kudos to the mayor and councilor Panioto for not simply throwing up their hands and allowing this critical project to evaporate after the incoherent and let’s face it, the incompetence of the other five city councilors who voted down the plan in December of 2021.</p>

<p>So here we go again. Now, if we were dealing with a rational and competent group who understood their folly and learned anything at all then we could all breathe a sigh of relief knowing that we dodged a bullet and that the modified plan would be approved. But that’s not likely to be the case. In fact, unless the same five councilors who brought about the last economic development train wreck suddenly awaken from their current stupor this plan will be known as Train Wreck Redo. We will all be witnesses to watching these five back up the train and do it all over again.</p>

<p>It begs the question, “Why?” or “What are these people thinking?” Well, since December we’ve heard every sort of nonsensical excuse and rationalization from these five. Anyone who tries to explain the value of Wheeler is summarily ignored. Simply put, they are tone deaf.</p>

<p>When trying to understand their thought process there is one recurring rumor being bantered about surrounding a plan being concocted to bring some form of sports field house to the property which requires both lots. Albeit it is rumored but this rumor seems to have a little bit of a “where there’s smoke there’s fire” element about it. Rumor or reality, it’s fantasy land.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, let’s deal with reality. The Boys &amp; Girls Club spent years and raised millions of dollars (led by some of Bristol’s best businesspeople) to create a beautiful facility with a sizable fieldhouse. The club gets good use but the organization, like many other non-profits needs to do significant fund raising every year to maintain operations. The fieldhouse is not self-financing.</p>

<p>Additionally, the attempt to reuse the former Armory while a noble effort has been challenging and has required loans from the city and tax abatements. They don’t have the needed capital. Such would be the case with a similar plan for Centre Square. Private Equity is not lining up to pour in the millions needed for such facilities and no bank will issue debt to an organization lacking liquidity and no way of paying back the debt. A reality that our highly qualified ECD commissioners understand and thus has put forth a viable option in the Wheeler project.</p>

<p>So here we are. On the cusp of another critical vote for our downtown and by all counts the votes are not there to make it happen. Mayor Caggiano, this will be a watershed moment in your political career. One can only hope that you are working the phones and the process into the wee hours for the next few days. This is a “all hands-on deck” moment and requires every ounce of your focus. In fact, your time spent on this will be far more important to the city than useless resolutions regarding gubernatorial executive powers or coming up with excuses in the form of council meeting commentary about the “60 years of failures downtown.” All of which are nothing more than form over substance. Your handpicked cabal couldn’t comprehend the value of Tom Barnes and Barnes Group, so a history lesson will be useless.</p>

<p>As for the City Council, it’s up to Bristol residents to make their voices heard. Even then be prepared for a group who only wants to hear from you if you agree with them. Otherwise, you simply don’t matter. I actually had one of them say to me via email that “They [Wheeler]will only move their headquarters elsewhere.” Like we have numerous companies knocking down the door to move their headquarters here. It was nothing more than arrogance masquerading as intelligence. That said, it’s time to sound off. This is the link to the Bristol City Hall website page with a listing of each Councilor’s email and telephone. Flood their inboxes and fill their voicemail. Tell them, “Do your job and vote yes on the updated Wheeler Clinic Headquarters plan.”</p>
