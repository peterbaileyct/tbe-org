<p>Bristol Police Officers extended warm welcomes to princesses, superheroes, witches and ghosts at the Bridge Community Church Monday night during the second annual Faith &amp; Blue Trunk or Treat. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We started last year for the first time, and we loved it,” Pastor Todd Williams of Bridge Community Church said. “We all said, 'Hey, we got to do this every year.'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We love the police, and we want to support the police, especially with all the seriousness that they have to deal with and everything that's happened," said Williams. "It's a chance for them to relax and have a lot of fun. I think it's therapeutic for everyone."</p>

<p>As twilight descended, the Bridge Community Church parking lot was transformed into a Halloween wonderland. Children accompanied by their families and friends embarked on a candy-filled adventure as they visited an array of intricately decorated trunks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Police Department's booth quickly emerged as a popular destination for attendees of all ages. Officers warmly greeted community members and extended their hands in friendship. For the young ones, the police officers had prepared coloring books, decals, and, of course, a generous supply of candy.</p>

<p>Officer Alysha Pirog was busy throughout the evening greeting the public with her partner K9 Frankie. The sweet-natured support dog, trained by the nonprofit Puppies Behind Bars, captivated the hearts of the attendees including Five-year-old Mya Beckett.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The doggie is so nice, and really soft,” Beckett said. “I pet her so much, and I like her costume."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankie herself was adorned in a bumblebee costume for the occasion, much like 11-month-old Bryson Dilley, who attended the Trunk or Treat event with his parents. The sight of the two bumblebees embracing each other brought smiles to the faces of those gathered around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Everyone is always happy to see Frankie," Pirog said. "She's very relaxed in an environment like this, and it's wonderful to see the joy she brings to the children."</p>

<p>In addition to candy and decorations, children had the opportunity to get up close and personal with police vehicles, including a Bristol police cruiser and the Bristol Police Department evidence truck. This hands-on interaction provided children with a chance to ask questions about the roles each vehicle plays in keeping the community safe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family-friendly Faith &amp; Blue event had already drawn a substantial crowd by 5 p.m., with an estimated 400 visitors in attendance. Williams anticipated at least 1,000 visitors before the Trunk or Treat festivities concluded at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We'll have at least 1,000 people coming through," Williams said. "On average, they have been staying about 15 minutes, meeting the police officers, admiring the creatively decorated trunks, and collecting their candy. It's been a lot of fun for all."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
