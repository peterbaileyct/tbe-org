<p>From the opening tip to the final buzzer, the Bristol Eastern girls were dominated by a bigger, faster, and more skilled opponent Tuesday night. Holy Cross pressed the Lancers into a blizzard of turnovers and scored almost at will in a parade of lay-ups. The result was a disappointing end to the Lancer’s season, a 69-33 defeat in the CIAC Class L quarterfinals Tuesday night in Waterbury.</p>

<p>The Crusaders ‘ Shania Howard scored 25 points by driving to the basket and converting the lay-in multiple times, and in the process she also surpassed 1,000 points in her Holy Cross career. She was ably supported by the inside power of Corrine Lomax, who added 19 points to the winning cause.</p>

<p>Autumn Udoh was the only Lancer to reach double figures, totaling 12 points for the night. </p>

<p>As disappointing as the final result was, Eastern has to be credited with a great run this year. A team that was composed of mostly underclassmen compiled a 17-7 record, winning two games in the state tournament, and entertaining their fans with their grit and hustle throughout the year.</p>

<p>The future for the Lancers certainly looks bright, as they will return five players with a ton a varsity experience, led by Udoh, who had an outstanding sophomore year for Coach Tony Floyd.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s game marked the last one for seniors Vanessa Drury and Lauren Ayotte. They provided their teammates with an example of teamwork, heart, and leadership throughout the 2023-2024 campaign and will be greatly missed next year.</p>
