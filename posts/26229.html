<p>Leggett had control issues at the start of the game, and Hall took advantage scoring two runs in the top of the first inning. After back-to-back walks to Tyler Redden and Mason Hebert, Chase Hanawalt singled to load the bases with no outs. Leggett struck out the next batter, but then walked Quinn LaRock forcing in Redden. Calvin Cianflone followed with an RBI groundout, and Hall led 2-0. </p>

<p>As it turned out, those were the only two runs that Hall would score as Leggett settled down in the 2nd, and Hall was unable to score again for the rest of the game.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the first, Hallâ€™s Cianflone struck out the lead off hitter, but then surrendered six consecutive hits beginning with a triple by Leggett. Devin Kulas singled driving in Leggett, and Cal Chance singled to put two men on. Cole Raymond singled driving in Kulas, and the score was tied 2-2. Ryan Kilpatrick followed with a single to load the bases. Then Jonathan Remillard doubled clearing the bases and giving St Paul a 5-2 lead.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 6th, a walk to Chance, a single by Raymond and a walk Corrado loaded the bases with 2 outs. On a wild pitch, Chance attempted to score from 3rd. On the play at the plate, the catcher's throw to the covering pitcher was mishandled. That allowed not only Chance to score, but also pinch runner Jack Dennehy scored from 2nd....and the game was over - 12-2.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
