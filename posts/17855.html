<p>For over twenty years, the Clem Roy Baseball Field at Bristol Eastern High School has only had a fence for 1/3 of the outfield. This point was one of many made by TBE sports writer, Mike Letendre, in a recent series of articles.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, after many requests over many years, it appears that this year may be the one that sees the fence completed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At last week’s meeting of the Finance Committee of the Board of Education, a vote on the proposed funding to complete the fence was approved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to an email response from the chair of the committee, Dante Tagariello, “The finance committee voted to fund the fence pending city approval from the BOE. Our surplus from FY 21-22 was in excess of $500,000. Therefore the recommendation was to request that the City set aside said funds for BOE use with a specific request that no more than $30,000 shall be spent on the BE fence (the $30K is a revised figure we received from a vendor that has been used by the BOE in the past). The BOE staff still needs to go to the Board of Finance with this request for approval, which should happen this month.”</p>

<p>So a huge step has been taken, but the proposal still needs to be approved by the Board of Finance. <br><br>It appears that there is a real chance that this spring Bristol Eastern can join the hundreds of teams in the CIAC that have a fence enclosing their entire outfield.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
