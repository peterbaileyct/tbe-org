<p>BRISTOL - Fresh off its shutout victory in Pod C play on Saturday, the Bristol Senior American Legion baseball team stays in the winners bracket of the postseason tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 was able to top Northeast in a 6-0 final in an opening round game of the Northern Division state tournament from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol moves on to play the top ranked team in the pod, Waterford, on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since it’s a winner’s bracket game, elimination is not at stake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford, the Zone 6 champion, easily toppled Enfield by an 8-0 score on Saturday to advance to play Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showdown against Post 2 takes place from Waterford High School at 1 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re always pretty tough,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of Waterford. “It will be a tough challenge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol pitcher Matt Beaucar threw a two hitter against Northeast to help the team advance in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Sunday, Roberto Cruz will take the mound for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s undefeated this season at 4-0 and should give the Waterford squad all sorts of problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The winner of the Bristol/Waterford contest earns two nights off before getting back to work on Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If we win that game, we’ll be in the driver's seat,” said LaPenta. “You have to be beaten twice.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford (22-3) was one game better than Willimantic (20-4) this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program finished the regular season winning 11 straight Zone 6 games while outscoring the competition 204-52 over the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford is a scoring machine but Post 2 has the firepower and pitching to make the Zone 6 winner sweat more than a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was really pleased with today,” said LaPenta of the Northeast victory. “I wasn’t too stressed. It went pretty easy so all in all, it was a good day.” </p>
