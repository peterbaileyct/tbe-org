<p>BRISTOL -- After a stellar scholastic career, Bristol Eastern volleyball star Hannah Webber knew she wanted to compete at the collegiate level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber, a sensational middle hitter, was one of the driving forces on the Lancers’ 2021 CCC Tournament championship squad while Eastern was one match away from earning a Class L title berth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber has good size for the NCAA Division I level and the talented athlete is taking her skills to Merrimack College -- intent on helping the young program into its third and fourth steps of Division I play, competing against a higher level of competition.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The former Division II program, a former member of the Northeast-10 Conference, jumped up a major rung in women’s athletics and Webber is certainly ready and eager for the challenge of NCAA Division I athletics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber’s time at Bristol Eastern helped her prepare for a collegiate journey after a stellar career for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central Connecticut Conference is a hotbed for volleyball, one of the toughest leagues in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber led the Eastern program with 562 kills, dropped down 84 aces, and blocked 30 shots -- all team-leading totals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, she boosted up 133 digs to help the Lancers start its offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber was one of three players for the Kingstreeters to play a team-high 95 sets, averaging a program best 5.9 kills-per-set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She led the squad in hitting percentage with a .267 clip and ended up second on the program in receptions with 388.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber earned several awards along the way over a tremendous senior campaign in 2021.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was elected to the Connecticut High School Coaches Association Senior All-Star volleyball Team and was named to the 2021 AVCA High School All Region 1 squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber also earned CCC South All-Conference honors along with teammates Lauren Bender and Abby Jones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had an eventful postseason, dropping in 22 kills against Torrington, another 17 versus Windsor, while scooping up 24 kills and two blocks in a sweep against St. Joseph.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her final scholastic match against Simsbury, Webber blasted the Trojans for 17 kills and two aces over a tough 3-0 losing effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that showdown against Torrington, Webber flipped down her 500th kill which was a tremendous accomplishment by the senior standout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the CCC Tournament championship game against Simsbury (3-1) on the road, Webber dropped the hammer down on the Trojans with 35 kills to help the Lancers snare the title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her CCC Tournament was tremendous off Eastern’s 4-0 run that ended with a conference championship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber nearly scooped up 130 kills over CCC postseason play to pace Eastern’s offensive assault.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was tremendous all season long, whether it was a 43 kill, five ace, and nine dig performance against Conard in an upset 3-2 CCC Tournament win or spiking down 21 kills in a 3-0 win against crosstown rival Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over her senior season, Webber earned several awards including MaxPreps/AVCA Player of the Week honors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very soon, she’ll be competing collegiately at Merrimack -- nestled in North Andover, Mass., which is just a stone’s throw away from Boston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The college has over 22 teams participating in intercollegiate sports with women’s programs making up 13 of those squads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors recently joined the ranks of NCAA Division I in 2019 -- starting off with eight home matches as a member school in the Northeast Conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Webber will be joining a very diverse roster, linking up with players from all over the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Webber helps the program to its next win, it will be its first match victory in quite some time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Merrimack did not win a match in 2021 -- going 0-29 last year -- but if the program can add talented individuals with the abilities of Webber, the women’s volleyball team isn’t too far away from that badly needed victory.</p>
