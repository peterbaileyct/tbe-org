<p>BRISTOL – After getting blanked by powerful Wethersfield last Monday afternoon, how was the Bristol Lacrosse coop going to respond when Windsor showed up to town on Thursday?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How about another resounding victory as the Bristol contingent smoked the Warriors by a 16-3 push from Alumni Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event never got off the ground in terms of competition as the Bristol outfit led 6-0 through 12 minutes and then rumbled up nine goals over second period play to snare a 15-0 halftime cushion that was never threatened.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it was a total team effort from start to finish by the locals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time Windsor tallied a goal, several Eastern’s starters were already on the bench as the subs enjoyed some extended playing time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Jayden Glasper led all scorers with four goals while Ian Reardon (three goals, two assists) and Brady Bell (three goals, two assists)&nbsp;were active on the offensive front.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase Dauphinee cashed in on a couple goals as did Dylan Brown (team leading six ground balls).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Braydan Dwyer and Aiden Collins added one goal apiece for the Kingstreeters.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vinny Howley (two assists) and RJ Fellows (one assist) helped to pace an extremely aggressive offensive attack by the home team.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeper Max Stavens might have been a bit bored that day, wrangling up a couple saves off the minimal chances the Warriors had at the net.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern reserve keeper Nick Martino led the Bristol operation in saves with five - all coming over second half play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters’&nbsp;defense was up to the task, only allowing scores late in fourth period play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Excellent Start</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The match against Windsor ended the coop’s April play as the squad went an impressive 6-2, a record month for the ever-improving program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the action doesn’t slow down much this week as Bristol has two big showdowns to open the month of May.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, the squad from Suffield/Windsor Locks comes to Bristol for a 6 p.m. match and then on Thursday, it’s time for a little CCC South confrontation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The coop from Meriden (Maloney/Platt) is on the docket for Bristol to end the week.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The conference tilt takes place at 3:45 p.m. at Platt High School in Meriden.&nbsp;</p>
