<p>Janet (Lucier) Kohl Bugryn, 97, of Bristol, widow of Frederick Kohl and Daniel Bugryn, died on Thursday, Oct. 27, at The Pines at Bristol.

<p>She met her first husband, Fred, while roller skating at Lake Compounce. They married after he returned from the service in 1946, built a home in Forestville where they raised their two daughters, and resided there for 37 years, until his death in 1984. She worked at General Electric in Plainville, and various small manufacturing facilities over the years.</p>

<p>Janet was married to her second husband, Dan, for 17 years until his death in 2007. In her later years she and her sister, Connie, had many adventures together, shopping, laughing and enjoying each other. Her favorite niece, Judy, gave a lot of her time to her Aunt Janet, taking her shopping and out to lunch, and also enjoying a lot of laughs.  She was the best grandma to her grandchildren, babysitting often, spoiling them and enjoying them, especially when making their favorite breakfasts to their specifications when they had days off from school.</p>
