<p>The inlands/wetlands application for a project that would bring 16 new houses to 10 acres of private property that contain rare geological formations from the Ice Age and abuts the Hoppers-Birge Pond Nature Preserve off Perkins Street took a step closer to approval at the commission's meeting on Monday evening.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The application from P &amp; B Properties for its proposed Bristol Village Development involves constructing a bridge over an existing stream to attain access to the property and construction of two residential units, of a total of 16, within 100 feet of an area that has been designated as wetlands on the Bristol wetlands map. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The property is comprised of three lots, formerly owned by the Schaffrick family, with frontage at 260 Perkins St. Access to the property from Perkins Street requires the construction of a bridge over a stream. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The access is critical in the plans for the open development which will include earth removal for the later stages of the project as well as for residents of the new houses, if the project gains approval. The earth removal operation must come before the city's Zoning Commission for approval after the inlands/wetlands commission makes its decision and is part of the approval process.</p>

<p>At its meeting on Monday, Aug. 12, the inlands/wetlands commission voted to go forward with a public hearing and a site walk for Application 2034. The site walk has been scheduled for Monday, Aug. 26, at 5:30 p.m., beginning at 260 Perkins St. The public hearing has been set for Monday, Sept. 9 at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>In other business, the commission voted to set up a site walk for a separate application, #2035, amending Application 1964 at 175 Southdown Dr. and 1936 Perkins St. for a proposed residential subdivision. Application 2035 requests the construction of a temporary 20 feet by 40 feet trench for the installation of utilities over a single day with immediate restoration of the stream.</p>

<p>The site walk for Application 2035 will take place during the site walk for the Bristol Village Development on Aug. 26.</p>

<p>Under communications, the commission received a report updating the work orders following the flooding that occurred last year in July. The 97-page report focuses on Public Works response and possible steps to mitigate similar flooding as the result of intense rain in the future.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
