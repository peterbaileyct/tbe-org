<p>Taste of Bristol tickets are now available for sale for the 2024 promotion, it was announced by the West End Association yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year's sales broke a record, according to president Jesse Jablon. The proceeds support the activities of the West End Association, both in its mission to promote and maintain its neighborhood as well funding the annual Rockwell Park Festival.</p>

<p>Purchasers of the tickets, which are $5, get 20 percent off at 42 local restaurants during the months of March and April 2024.</p>

<p>Each ticket includes an entry in a drawing for over $500 in restaurant gift certificates (prizes range from $10 to $25 per winner). The drawing, to be held on or about April 30, 2024, will be drawn from all tickets received by April 20, 2024.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
