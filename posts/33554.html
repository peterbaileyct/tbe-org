<p>In the world of music, some voices are so distinctive that they capture the hearts of audiences around the globe. Joe Archambeault, known to many as J.J. Midnight, is one such artist, who has made an impact with his vocal talents as the lead singer of the renowned Queen tribute band, "Celebrating Queen," which will be performing at the Rockwell Theater this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born and raised in Bristol, Archambeault’s journey from singing in the hallways of Bristol Central High School to gracing stages worldwide began in his childhood home on South Street Ext at the corner of Wolcott Street. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Growing up in a family of 11 children, Archambeault embraced music at an early age. His father, recognizing the universal appeal of music, made it a point to teach all his children to either sing or play an instrument. This early exposure to the world of music ignited a lifelong passion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He told us, if you’re going to learn another language, learn music first because that's something that they speak everywhere. He's right; Queen music is universal, it's everywhere. When I go and I play in Europe to a fair or a festival with 10,000 to 15,000 people and I'm singing the songs, they're singing along.”</p>

<p>One of Archembeault’s most notable attributes as a singer is his large vocal range. His powerful voice can effortlessly tackle Queen's iconic catalog, and he's known for his ability to hit those challenging Freddie Mercury high notes with finesse and precision. But Joe brings more than just vocal prowess to the stage; he infuses each performance with a theatrical element, complete with costumes reminiscent of the legendary Freddie Mercury himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Returning to Bristol for the inaugural Downtown Live show at the newly renovated Rockwell Theater at BAIMS holds a special significance for Archembeault. He performed at the Rockwell Theater in 2015, before its transformation, and he's thrilled to return to his hometown to share his music once again. His upcoming performance will be a homecoming of sorts, as he anticipates seeing familiar faces from his 1978 Bristol Central graduating class.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm coming to my hometown to play in this beautiful theater, and it's a great opportunity. The timing of this show falls about a month before my 45<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;high school reunion. I know for a fact that there are several people from my Bristol Central High School class that are going to be there. I expect a good amount of that audience will be people that I know or know me. I think it’s going to be a great show.”</p>

<p>Archambeault began to share his passion with young performers in 2014 when he founded the Everybody Sings Project, a nonprofit organization that presents seminars in schools to promote the health benefits of singing. Archambeault himself has embraced singing as part of the healing process in his daily life following a devastating accident in 2019, when the vocalist suffered a traumatic brain injury. The singer was hit by a car while riding his bike in Sarasota, Fla., causing physical and emotional pain. Music and performing have played a pivotal role on his road to recovery over the past four and a half years.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now I use music to ease the symptoms, depression, memory loss, anxiety. I’m self-medicating with my own medicine. You have good people around you to help you get better.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol sports fans may remember Archambeault as a standout athlete during the 1970s as a pitcher in Bristol's American Legion baseball league. During his Bristol athletic career, Archambeault held an impressive record of 28 wins and 5 losses, including a 19-game winning streak. The former pitcher made history at Muzzy Field in 1991 when he organized an exhibition featuring the New England Grey Sox team, which included former MLB players like Bill "Spaceman" Lee, Bob Stanley, and Dick Radatz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reflecting on the people who have inspired him, Archambeault acknowledges the positive impact of his freshman baseball coach from Bristol Central High School, John Girard, as well as a meeting with Bristol vocalist Frank Carroll.</p>

<p>“He was a famous opera singer with the New York outfits, and he used to give singing lessons. I went to his home for one lesson, he plays scales, and we sing them. Then he had me sing some ad-lib stuff, and he said to me, 'Get out of here, I can't teach you, you're great.'”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Archambeault currently resides in Las Vegas, he is never far from family. Joe spends his days performing alongside his youngest brother, Carl Archambeault, who is also member of Celebrating Queen. Carl's contribution to the band is vital, providing 4-part harmonies through the use of a device called voicestravarius that he developed himself. This allows the band to recreate the big vocal sounds of Queen's original recordings when playing live performances.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Basically, he takes this device, and he sings into it, and it sends out the harmonies in his voice so he can do four of the five part harmony. So, when we do Queen live, we and feature all the harmonies and it’s all live, there’s no tracks. Being with him in the band makes it a dream. We can’t wait to bring this show to Bristol.”</p>

<p>Celebrating Queen will perform Saturday, Sept. 9, at 7 p.m. at the Rockwell Theater at BAIMS. To learn more, visit <a href="https://bristolct.myrec.com/info/activities/program_details.aspx?ProgramID=29491">https://bristolct.myrec.com/info/activities/program_details.aspx?ProgramID=29491</a>.</p>
