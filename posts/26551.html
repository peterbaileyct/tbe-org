<p>The program at Rockville had several reserves at the ready, eventually running three sets of midfielders that eventually overwhelmed the Bristol program.</p>

<p>Eastern’s Emma Stavens jammed in two hat tricks worth of goals (six) while Vanessa Drury added two scores.</p>

<p>Kenzie Aparo and Taigan Parent each flashed in a goal for the Kingstreeters.</p>

<p>Jayna Hatcher and company played well on defense, helping out outstanding keeper Avery Ellis, as the match was in doubt throughout.</p>

<p>The winning squad went on a 7-2 game-ending run to end the match as the Rams won it by five goals.</p>
