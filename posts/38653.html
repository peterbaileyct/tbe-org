<p>The Carousel Museum announced this week that they will be providing children aged 12 and under with free admission in 2024. </p>

<p>“I'm super excited about the free admission for kids and the upgrades we've made to the Tinker Workshop,” said Education Manager Katie Bassett. “It's been a project close to my heart, and I'm thrilled to see it come alive.”</p>

<p>As part of the new initiative, which was made possible by support from the Barnes Foundation, children aged 12 and under will receive free general admission to the Carousel Museum. Guests will have the opportunity to experience the art, education and history of carousels through the museum’s extensive collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Younger guests will also have access to an immersive experience at the museum’s Tinker Workshop, which allows kids to explore their creativity through hands-on activities.</p>

<p>“The idea for the Tinker Workshop upgrades stemmed from wanting to create a more interactive and engaging space for our young visitors,” Bassett said. </p>

<p>“We've put a lot of effort into revamping it over the last few months, adding cool features like a larger selection of Legos, a new stage for our little performers, an enhanced puppet play area, and a cozy reading nook with a variety of books. Plus, there are plenty of art projects and coloring pages to spark creativity.”</p>

<p>The Tinker Workshop is designed to spark curiosity and inspire learning through hands-on activities and interactive play. The dynamic space aims to foster creativity and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning through the use of art supplies, Legos, books, a puppet play area, costumes and a stage.</p>

<p>Bassett said that combining free access to the museum with the immersive experiences in the Tinker Workshop will provide an unforgettable educational adventure for children.</p>

<p>“What I love most about these updates is the potential for kids to dive into imaginative play and learning,” Bassett said. “It's not just a place to play; it's a space where they can explore their creativity and learn in a fun, hands-on environment. I can't wait to see the children's reactions and hear their laughter filling the space.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
