<p>With last Friday’s equinox, autumn has astronomically and meteorologically arrived in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sugar maples are showing large bursts of bright orange and yellow leaves throughout their branches, and red maples are turning magnificent shades of deep scarlet and maroon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s been a small but noticeable change in fall foliage over the past week due to the sharp drop in daytime temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forecast for the upcoming week shows a noticeable 10-degree drop from last week’s low-70s temps. Daytime highs are predicted to reach the low to mid 60s, while overnight lows will dip into the high 40s. An abundance of sunshine is predicted, which should enhance the fall colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recommended Walk for Leaf Peeping: Loop around Bristol Hospital</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This a hilly one mile walk with beautiful views and beautiful architecture.&nbsp;The walk begins with a steady decline down Goodwin Street, with the lowest elevation (366 feet) on the corner of Queen Street and Brewster Road. There’s a steep incline on Bradley Street up to Stearns Street, where elevation peaks at 493 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.</p>
