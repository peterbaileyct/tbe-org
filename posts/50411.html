<p>A quiet morning in Bristol’s Federal Hill neighborhood was abruptly disrupted when an American black bear made an unexpected visit to a local yard. The bear’s uninvited appearance, while not uncommon in areas adjacent to natural habitats, turned into a memorable event for the residents who witnessed it.</p>
<p style="white-space: normal;">The encounter began when the black bear wandered into a Bradley Street yard, where it immediately set its sights on a nearby trash can. The bear managed to pry open the lid with ease and extract a trash bag using its mouth. </p>

<p style="white-space: normal;">Neighbors watching from their windows attempted to drive the bear away with a cacophony of sounds, including loud shouts and the repeated blasting of an airhorn; tactics intended to startle the bear and encourage it to leave the scene.</p>

<p style="white-space: normal;">Despite the noisy commotion, the bear remained unfazed. It continued to rummage through the trash can, seemingly indifferent to the commotion around it. The bear’s focus soon shifted when it discovered an apple among the discarded food and wrappers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: revert; white-space: normal;">The bear took the tasty red treat in its mouth and devoured the apple in a single bite. The entire scene was over in moments, leaving behind only the shredded remains of the trash bag. The bear then ambled away, disappearing into the surrounding greenery with its newfound snack.</span></p>
