<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WEST HARTFORD - The pitching rotation for the Bristol American Legion Baseball team is a bit in flux this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with a plethora of games on tap to end the month of June, it’s all hands-on deck for Post 2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next six days, Bristol has a half dozen games including make-ups and challenges at RCP (Monday, 5:45 p.m.), Enfield (Wednesday, 5:45 p.m.) and Middletown (Thursday, 7 p.m.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why Post 2 went with mainly reserves against West Hartford on Friday (10-2 loss).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta could have gone with an elite pitcher against Post 96 but instead went to reserves over the Zone 3 interdivisional battle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re playing Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,” said LaPenta of the upcoming week. “[Ryan] Maglio could have pitched, Declan [Schenck] could have pitched but I’m not throwing those guys today. Because if I throw them and we lose 2-1, it’s a killer.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I have to go after the games where we have a better shot at to get the win with our best pitcher.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol held its own on the mound against West Hartford as Gavin Colvin threw three good innings while Isaac Roberge (2.3 IP, half dozen hits, three earned runs) and even Josh Dunn saw time on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And unlike past seasons, Bristol plays West Hartford just once and the veteran coach wanted to keep his arms fresh and available for Zone 3, American League play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 96, a former Zone 1 foe, is currently the leader of the National division at 8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We only play them once,” said LaPenta of West Hartford. “They’re one of the top teams on their side.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The American League</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zone 3’s American division has been very competitive as Bristol (3-3-1) is currently in fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of Sunday, Ellington (8-2) leads the pack, carrying a 1.5 game lead over send place Middletown (5-2-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast (6-3) is in third while Simsbury (6-4), after a slow start, currently sits in fourth place and is two games out of first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Bristol, Tri County (4-6) and South Windsor (3-7) are hanging around at the bottom of the division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LaPenta is saving his arms for those games Bristol will battle more than once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
