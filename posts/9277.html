<p>Members of the Bristol Interfaith Coalition have invited the greater Bristol community to&nbsp;join&nbsp;together&nbsp;virtually&nbsp;on Wednesday, November 24, 2021&nbsp;for&nbsp;the annual&nbsp;interfaith&nbsp;Thanksgiving service.&nbsp;The service will be live streamed by First Congregational Church with Pastor Kristen Kleiman leading a blended live and pre-recorded event.</p>

<p>This year’s theme is <strong>Welcoming the Stranger.&nbsp;</strong>Please&nbsp;join in helping&nbsp;an Afghani&nbsp;family relocate to New Britain through the Simsbury United Methodist Church’s Welcoming&nbsp;Project. The church is&nbsp;a co-sponsor of IRIS&nbsp;(Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services) and has already raised $15,000 towards the process. More information&nbsp;about the program&nbsp;and how to donate is at the end of this article.</p>

<p>Working with IRIS, this group will walk with this family in getting an apartment and furnishing it, enrolling children in school and helping them adjust, and getting them planted in a new community. As people of faith and as citizens of the United States, we remember that we too have been strangers that needed welcoming and planting, and generously look to give back what we have first received.</p>

<p>The service itself will start with&nbsp;Nighthawk Flying, a medicine man with four tribal nations&nbsp;who&nbsp;will offer a Native American prayer of thanksgiving and will set the tone for the evening. Representatives from Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Sikh, Pagan, Jewish and Baha’i communities will contribute to the program and Mayor Caggiano will offer a Thanksgiving message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Music will be provided by two bell choirs&nbsp;and a combined adult choir&nbsp;from several congregations&nbsp;which&nbsp;will contribute&nbsp;a&nbsp;selection. Kristen Russo, as song leader,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be live and will&nbsp;lead everyone at home in several songs with words provided on the screen and in a printable program. There will be other opportunities for viewers to participate actively as well.&nbsp;</p>
