<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">A lifelong Bristol resident, Doug graduated from Bristol Central High School. He retired as a mechanic from the City of Bristol Parks Department where he worked for 37 years. Doug loved spending his summers at his Cape Cod home with friends and family where he would float in the bay, reread a Joseph Lincoln novel or treat himself to fried clams at Arnold’s. </p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In the winter, Doug enjoyed spending time in Florida with Carol visiting with their friends, sitting in the sun at the beach or by the pool. He liked drag races, doing crossword puzzles with a cup of coffee and taking a nap. He made the best meatballs and baked beans. Always tinkering, Doug would rather work on a lawn mower than mow the lawn. He earned his nick name “Do-It-All-Duval” for his ability to fix anything, sometimes over the phone. He refused to throw away a single bolt. </p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">“Pop-pop” will be greatly missed by his grandchildren who were blessed with his wild bedtime stories. Most of all, Doug could find the joke in any situation. He seldom held back yet never offended. His instant wit will most certainly be missed.</p>
