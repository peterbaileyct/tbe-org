<p>Come Sunday morning, the snow will have arrived. Forecasts through the week have predicted from 7 inches at one point to 12 at another. On Saturday, we were looking at between 9 and 10 inches. Either way I will have gotten out the snowblower--a new electric one that Mary and I purchased last year when our old workhorse gas-powered monster conked out and we like to think we had no alternative.</p>

<p>It is a very nice Ryobi, much lighter than the old one, and one that requires a couple of passes where I might have only had to make one. The plan is to get one pass done before midnight on Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most of the week, snow was forecast along the coast, where the grandkids are. The hope was that they would see their first real snowfall-- the oldest is now 4 with the next oldest getting to there soon.   The forecast does not look that promising for them.</p>

<p>Around the city, the news this week centered on whether the Ordinance Committee would approve a revision to the current provision and so to allow the possession, sale and consumption of alcohol at public, nonschool performances at the Rockwell Theater at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School. The public participation was overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The City Council will take up the topic at its meeting this coming week.</p>

<p>Also this week, Bakery on Maple informed the community through its Facebook page that it needed to make a decision about its future, that is, whether it would remain open. A good turnout would help the owners Erika Stirk and David Landi decide--and also determine next steps including refinancing. </p>

<p>On Saturday, the response was overwhelmingly positive, with lines of customers who cleared out the offerings and sent the owners to the store for more ingredient three times before closing time. Even then, the shop closed early, informing patrons that they would be open Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week begins with a podcast that is a little out of the ordinary, "Fixing France: Nabila Ramdani on How to Repair a Broken Republic," from Intelligence Squared. Sometimes it's good to step back from the American Experiment and listen to what is happening to the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Equality, Liberty and Fraternity," the cry of the French Republic is not so very different from our own "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness," in some ways, very different in others. The point, however, is that as a democracy it is facing some existentialist threats of its own. What they are, how they have evolved, is a good way to gauge our own development, especially on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection.

<p>If you are into setting goals and resolutions for the new year, you might try the profanely titled, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck," a podcast with Mark Manson, the author of a book of the same title. The episode that is of some interest is "How to Enjoy Doing Hard Things," featuring Ali Abdaal, author of the new book, "Feel-Good Productivity." It's going to reshape how you think about work and productivity. Click <a href="https://markmanson.net/podcast/doing-hard-things-ali-abdaal">here</a>.</p>

<p>For reading, there is always The New Yorker. A piece on the French Impressionist Camille Pissarro, redefines genius and when and how it might be determined. That requires a trip to one of Bristol's libraries, though. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, it appears this has been a week devoted to French pursuits, there are two novels by Annie Ernaux, the 2022 Nobel Laurate. These are two distinct books, in that the manner of their telling defies a typical read. One is a coming-of-age story, very challenging and sometimes difficult subject matter, "Do What They Say or Else," and the other, "The Years," written years later, in a manner that at first I found entirely off-putting but before long could not put down. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
