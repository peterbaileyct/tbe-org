<p>The Bristol Junior American Legion team is in line for one of the spots in the upcoming 17U State Tournament - beginning this Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into Friday, Post 2 is hanging in at 11-8 and despite going 3-7 over its past 10 games, this squad has the pitching to make a deep state tournament run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if Bristol’s pitching depth isn’t needed at the 19U level, the contribution of two-way chuckers such as Celeb Molinsky, Gavin Colvin and Declan Schenck could all make primetime appearances for the Juniors.</p>

<p>This team came out of the gate firing while injuries and ‘call-ups’ depleted the juniors roster a bit and the job several coaches have done while head coach Bill Mason is home, taking care of family, has been noteworthy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 pitchers Brian Grabowski, Drew Martineau, Johnathan Montgomery, Mason Harris, among others, help to put together a tremendous pitching rotation and Bristol can match up well against all the teams the state of Connecticut has to offer in postseason play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s the official 17U Tournament rules as Bristol is preparing for a long postseason jaunt:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Sixteen 17U teams will qualify for the tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The regular season ends today and if play-in games are necessary, those contests will commence on Saturday at the site of the higher seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Zones 2 and 4 will be considered as one zone and Zones 3 and 6 will consist of the other teams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The two Zone champions will earn the top two seeds based on winning percentage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*All remaining teams will be seeded three through 16, also based on winning percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The modified double elimination Sectional Tournament (four pods of four teams) is expected to commence on Tuesday, July 18 at the site of the higher seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Games will take place on July 18, 20 and 21 and two teams will advance from each pod to the super regional event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Super Regional</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The 17U Connecticut Super Regional will be held at South Windsor and Pat Kidney field in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Super Regional will be a four team, double elimination tournament with the winner at each site advancing to the state finals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Super Regional games will commence from July 24-28.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*If Middletown or South Windsor qualifies for the CT 17U Super Regional, they will host their side of the bracket. Seed adjustments may be needed to place that squad on opposite side of the bracket to start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The Championship Game will be played in Middletown on Sunday, July 30.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the completion of the tournament, July could lead to an incredible month - and a possible Northeast Regional berth - if Bristol can make its expected run.</p>
