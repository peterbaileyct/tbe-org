<p>While channel surfing the TV on Monday, I tuned in to ESPN and saw the local regional Little League tournament for the boys being played here off Mix Street. It reminded me of where I met a lot of my friends for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s Don Soucy, Bob and Patty Kalat, Hank Lodge, Maryellen Holden and others. One gal I knew already was Diane Parker, who worked in the press box. Both Diane and I had worked at the Aetna. Diane was always smiling<em> and a welcome sight</em> to see when I climbed up those stairs to get topside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program also reminded me of Little League in town here, now down to just a few teams after having three leagues and locations. It also let me to recall my Little League days in the Forestville circuit with the Cobs and coach Bill Carpenter.</p>

<p><strong>The running Beardsleys</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ed told me once that their family came here from Vermont when he began his junior year at Bristol High in 1958. His dad, George Howard Beardsley, set up an accounting business right away, and his kids began to make their marks here, too. Ed was the oldest and excelled in basketball for the Bristol High Rams. Ed would leave his mark in helping establish Challenger baseball in the country.</p>

<p>Bart would play baseball starting in grammar school and Little League before winning something like 300 games pitching for Bristol-based teams. He did this up to senior play. No slouch, their younger sister, Georgiana, made her mark in school as a smart and popular student. There were two other sisters, who I had never met. The family has left a great legacy for themselves in Bristol.</p>

<p><strong>Kalats continue successes</strong></p>

<p>Bob isn’t paying me for his family’s coverage in my column, it’s just that I came across another accomplishment of theirs on Thursday. Bob’s son, Kevin, was a coach of this year’s Bristol Age 8-10 Little League softball team which won the local, district, state and New England Championship titles. Among the player’s was Kevin’s daughter, Lucy.</p>

<p>Again, a solid family that are winners!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>David Palaia (1950 -1974)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read that David had passed away this month, and with this tried to recall him because his name was so familiar to me. Then it hit me….so many times I saw him paving driveways in Bristol under the business of “Diamond Paving.” This took place all over the city. I never spoke with him, but admired his strong work ethic. He was no slouch.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A familiar family name here, he was called “Diamond Dave” by those who knew him. He earned every penny he worked for. I wonder just how many driveways he completed in Bristol?</p>

<p><strong>Guy Lachance</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A former City of Bristol employee, I’ve always liked this fellow who is now in retirement. Before he worked for the city, he, like “Diamond Dave,” could be seen roofing or working on homes in town. “Hello” to Guy if you read this!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
