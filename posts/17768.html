<p>BRISTOL - While ties in scholastic soccer are a reality in CIAC play, a stalemate is better than absorbing a tough loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Eastern boys soccer program just missed out on early chances in a CCC interdivisional showdown against Windsor on Friday, battling the Warriors to a 0-0 tie after eighty minutes of warfare on the turf from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both teams moved to 3-3-1 on the season while a huge city series battle is on the slate for the Lancers this coming Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern, off three consecutive defeats, have not lost over its last three matches (2-0-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the first of three straight home bouts, Eastern enjoyed the majority of shots and play in the first half against Windsor while the Warriors were in Lancers’ territory more in the second half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We moved the ball well and had decent looks at the goal, but</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>misfired on our shots in the first half," said Eastern coach Bill Sweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our defense was challenged in the second half as Windsor gained more of the offense and we kept them from getting solid shots at goal.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor goalie, Micah Gregory, and Eastern's Peyton Cummings, each</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>made eight saves over tremendous efforts with neither team able to scratch across a goal in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since allowing four goals to Farmington back on September 20, the Kingstreeters have outscored the competition 7-0 as shutouts have become common for the BEHS boys soccer program.</p>

<p><strong>This Week</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The homestand continues this week as Eastern battles New Britain on Monday at 6 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then fast forwarding to Saturday, it’s time for the first BE/BC confrontation as Central and Eastern compete on the pitch at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girls game between Central and Eastern commences on Thursday and is not the traditional doubleheader between the programs.</p>
