<p>MERIDEN - Bristol Eastern sharpshooting stud Taigan Parent recently said she wants to be known for being more than just a three-point shooter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, after her performance on Thursday at Platt, the senior standout might be trying to trick everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s because she bombed Platt for a career-high 33 points - draining seven three-pointers along the way - as the Lancers stomped the Panthers by a 65-37 final in a CCC South showdown from Orville Platt High School in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt (5-6), at points of the game, simply lost Parent on the court as she found herself open for shot after shot from downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her seven three-pointers were one off the school record of eight, established by Hannah Maghini who, ironically, was helping Eastern at the scorer’s table that evening in Meriden and is a current assistant coach for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent tied her brother, Elijah, as the duo have both made seven three-pointers in a game for the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both those performances came against the Panthers over the years and the brother/sister duo each scored 33 points over their career-high efforts against Platt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More tomfoolery came in the fact that Platt didn’t even attempt a three-pointer that evening while Parent was tremendous, hitting seven of her 15 attempts from long range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tremendous showing and an amazing accomplishment for Parent, but she wasn’t the only player to establish a new scoring mark that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ayotte scored a career-high 11 points while adding five rebounds, three assists and four steals over a huge complete game effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then freshman Autumn Udoh had another video game like showing, punching in 11 points, 11 rebounds and seven blocked shots - just missing a triple-double by three blocks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also had four assists and six steals as the first-year player dominated when she took the hardwood. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury posted six points, five rebounds and nine assists over a tremendous passing attack while Leah Roy nabbed six offensive rebounds to get her squad several second chances at the hoop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel added four rebounds while Tavia Swain had two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite never leading in the game, Platt’s Antwanette Tann had a huge night, posting team highs of 31 points and 19 rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No other player scored more than one hoop for the Panthers as Eastern’s defense held.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent scooped up nine points, Udoh had a lay-up while Ayotte scored the other three first period points as Eastern led 14-3 after eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, Parent was on complete fire, dropping in four of her five threes she attempted as her fourth 3 made it a 37-9 game with 1:01 remaining in the first half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Ayotte jumper made it a thirty-point game at the break as the home team didn’t have any answers against Eastern’s defensive press and transition offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drury dropped in a couple lay-ups in the third tilt and when Ayotte canned a leaner with 1:59 left in the quarter, the Lancers were ahead on the scoreboard 52-17.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt trailed 52-23 through three periods but Parent simply wouldn’t relent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parent scored another hoop, Udoh added a free throw and off another Ayotte field goal, Eastern snared a 59-27 push with 5:13 showing on the clock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers eventually emptied their bench and while the Panthers closed the deficit a bit in the end, Eastern still came with a huge win - scooping up a 65-37 victory to get back to .500 with a date against surging Bristol Central on deck.</p>
