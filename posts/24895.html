<p>Oxford knocked St Paul out of the unbeaten ranks with a hard fought 3-2 win in Bristol Wednesday afternoon. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oxford’s Quentin Glass picked up the win and came within 1 out of tossing a complete game. Nick Cerreto got that final out and picked up the save for Oxford. </p>

<p>Freshman Dom Napoletano took the loss in relief for St Paul.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St Paul jumped out to an early 2-0 lead as shortstop Devin Kulas hit a two run blast over the left field fence in the bottom of the 1st inning. As it turned out, that was the only scoring that St. Paul would do on the day.</p>

<p>Oxford tied things up in the 4th inning. After a lead off walk to Jake Matusovich, his brother Joe doubled to put men on 2nd and 3rd with no outs. A groundout by Brando Fletter scored Jake, and a bloop hit off a check swing by Kyle Donlon scored Joe.</p>

<p>The score remained 2-2 until the top of the 7th. Falcon reliever Dom Napoletano retired the first 2 hitters. After 7 pitches resulting in a 3-2 count, Joe Matusovich doubled to left. On the next pitch, Fletter doubled to center, and Oxford took its first lead 3-2.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the 7th, Quentin Glass struck out the first two St Paul batters. But back-to-back singles by Kyle Wilson and Logan Rembish put men on 1st and 3rd with 2 outs. That ended Glass' day on the mound, and Nick Cerreto came in to face Jamie Leggett. Leggett laced a line drive, but it was caught by Jake Matusovich at 2nd base, and the game was over.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
