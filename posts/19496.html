<p>MANCHESTER - Maybe Bristol Central cross country standout Frankie Porrini didn’t have the finish he envisioned at the 2022 CIAC Class L Championships last week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the senior harrier had a tremendous showing at the CIAC Open event from Wickham Park on Friday afternoon - making a top-15 finish and punching his ticket to the New England Championship.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-American Steeplechaser continues to impress on the cross country course this season as he moves on to yet another championship event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ended the day at Wickham with a stellar time of 16:30 over a loaded field.</p>

<p>“Bristol Central cross country’s Francis Porrini III is New England Championship bound after a 13th place finish at the State Open Championship,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk on Twitter. “What a season!”</p>

<p>Porrini’s time was the fifth fastest of all the runners from the Central Connecticut Conference as Hall’s Isaac Mahler (15:53) was the top CCC finisher.</p>

<p>“Frankie was smart and ran a more conservative first and second mile to be able to blast the third mile,” said Stafford-Kirk. “He moved from 20th to 18th to 13th through the race. I am so proud of Frankie’s dedication to training which got him here today! Making the NE meet is tough- and he is one of a few Bristol runners to to do it over the past couple decades."</p>

<p>Hall was able to snare the Open title behind an 86-point showing followed by Ridgefield (113), Danbury (120) and New Milford (134).</p>

<p>The 2022 NE Championship takes place next Saturday at Ponagansett High School in North Scituate, Rhode Island and Porrini will be part of an exclusive field.</p>
