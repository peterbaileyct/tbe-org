<p>The Panthers (0-13) have yet to win a game this season and once the Lancers constructed an early edge in the showdown, Career never caught up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent led the Lancers with 11 points, dropping in three 3s along the way, to go with three rebounds and a couple of assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury pumped in seven points, three rebounds, three assists and a game-high five steals while teammate Autumn Udoh nabbed six points, nine rebounds, three assists and rejected three shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leah Roy collected six points, eight rebounds and three steals and Gabriella Piendak splashed in a career-high six points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lauren Ayotte had two points, six rebounds and a couple steals, Amanda Noel scored three points and dished out two assists while Grace Browne and Hailey Beebe both saw extended playing time in the fourth quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Career was limited to only 12 points in the contest, the fewest since January 17 when the squad fell to Cheshire 32-9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jamyi Hernandez-Vega notched 10 of the Panthers’ 12 points but the squad never got a foothold in the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consecutive threes by Parent and Drury opened the contest for the Kingstreeters as Eastern built a quick 8-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A late jumper by Ayotte and a free throw from Roy gave the Lancers a 14-2 lead through eight minutes of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things didn’t improve for the Panthers in the second period and when Udoh rattled home a three at the end of the half, Eastern’s cushion was 21-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Late in the third, Noel made a hoop and when Parent drained a 3 at the third period horn, the visitors were on top 31-8 and Eastern turned to its bench for most of the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Piendak notched all three of her field goals in the fourth while Roy added a hoop to end things as Eastern grabbed a huge 29-point victory to get Floyd his 600th career win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
