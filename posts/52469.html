<p>The 77th district needs a positive change.&nbsp;Our current State Rep has been in office for 10 years and has a scant to zero record of aiding or improving our needs.&nbsp;She collected blankets and towels for an animal rescue facility in Waterbury but has not done much to make my life here in Bristol any better.&nbsp;It's time for a change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mary "Mim" Rydingsward&nbsp;has lived in the district for over 35 years,&nbsp;has worked&nbsp;to protect our Kern Park wooded wetlands&nbsp;for over 18 years, has lobbied legislature on behalf of clean air and water,&nbsp;served two terms as Registrar of Voters and eight years as President of the Pequabuck River Watershed Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a democracy champion, freedom fighter, healthcare protector, and environmental steward, she will safeguard elections and voting rights as well as offer sustainable, creative solutions to improvements that are needed.&nbsp;No matter what your affiliation, she will work for you. &nbsp;</p>
