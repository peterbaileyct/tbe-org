<p>NEWINGTON - The Newington girls basketball team, behind the play of the outstanding Lilly Ferguson, has continued to run through the scholastic season with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, Ferguson and crew was able to eventually shake Bristol Eastern, winning by a 55-41 final from the Richard E. Rogalski Gymnasium in Newington.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’Easters’ improved to 16-1 on the campaign while the Lancers dropped to 5-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Eastern did a credible job in hanging around with the ultra-talented squad as it was just a two-point game early in the second period and a 26-16 contest at the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A jumper by Ferguson (20 points) with 6:03 left to play in the contest saw the home squad zip up a 46-27 cushion as Newington cruised to the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bella Cucuta added 15 points for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the flip side, Ciara Collins was big in prime time again, notching a game-high 25 points - going a slick 10-for-10 from the charity stripe - along with 10 rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Janessa Gonzalez just missed out on a double-double, collecting eight points and a team best 13 rebounds. She cashed in on a perfect 6-of-6 showing from the free throw line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins and Gonzalez scored all of Eastern's 16 first half points, generating eight apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taigan Parent added four points and blocked two shots, Lauren Ayotte nabbed three rebounds while the duo of Tavia Swain and Leah Roy (two rebounds) combined to hit 4-of-4 free throws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of foul shots, Eastern went a perfect 22-of-22 from the free throw line for the game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Lancers did not shoot well from the field, neither did Newington as Eastern’s defense did enough to gum up the works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nor’Easters’ shot less than 37-percent from the field and while the Lancers never led in the game, that defensive effort kept things close.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newington grabbed a 12-4 edge early in things but an 8-2 burst by the Kingstreeters, including a sweet spin move and hoop by Collins, got Eastern within two at 14-12 with 6:23 left in the second quarter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home team then went on a 10-2 run with threes from Karissa and Marllie Zocco - followed by hoops by Ferguson and Kendall Miller - to propel Newington to a 24-14 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The halftime deficit was just 26-16 and when Collins banked in a hoop early in the third, Eastern was within eight points of the lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers could not inch any closer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern never quit as Collins connected on four straight foul shots to end the third but the visitors trailed 40-27 with eight minutes remaining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The home squad nearly built its lead to twenty early in the fourth and in the end, Newington was able to snare a big 55-41 win to keep its top-10 ranking intact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Coming Weeks</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a grueling CCC Interdivisional slate of games, Eastern finishes out the 2021-22 campaign by playing five of its final six contests from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It starts with a tough test on Monday against Middletown in Bristol and then Lewis Mills is in town on Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thursday is the Lancers final road game of the season in a showdown at Plainville (6:45 p.m.) and then it’s another Saturday attraction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard comes to BEHS on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. as the locals will be making its final playoff push.</p>
