<p>In quick succession, the Bristol-Burlington Health Department served ReWorld, formerly Covanta, with two notices and an order to reduce levels at trash to energy plant, and ReWorld filed an appeal, according to a statement by the lawyer representing BBHD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The appeal process will present additional and unnecessary expenses to already burdened taxpayers," attorney Keith R. Ainsworth of New Haven writes in the statement that has appeared in news reports and on the Covanta/Reworld Noise Complaints Facebook page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The BBHD stands by the results of its consultant and believes ReWorld should focus their efforts on exploring ways to reduce noise levels as opposed to spending the time and money to dispute an issue they already admitted creating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The noise complaints, which are documented on the noise complaints Facebook site, have been lodged from Bristol as well as surrounding cities and towns, including Southington and Plainville.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is only one of the issues facing ReWorld. A second is public reaction to its proposal to expand its current plant to include the burning of medical waste.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ReWorld's plans to expand have received preliminary approval from the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, however, a public hearing has been set for Tuesday, Oct. 22, at 6:30 p.m. via Zoom.</p>

<p>In addition, the comment period regarding the permits as been extended through Nov. 1. To comment, email Brent Madho at brent.madho@ct.gov or Dave Lariviere at dave.lariviere@ct.gov. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
