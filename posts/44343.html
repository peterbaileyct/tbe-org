<p>Come Sunday morning, the Bristol Boys and Girls Club will have completed its second consecutive sold out gala. Something chief executive office Jay Maia pointed out in his comments--the gala, sold out two years in a row; the UConn men with Bristol's Donovan Clingan, two consecutive years as national champions; and prior to this year, two consecutive National Boys and Girls Club Youth of the Year Award out of Bristol. Not bad.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week a plan to roundup and exterminate geese as part of a plan to clear Veterans Memorial Boulevard and Park, and a couple of other Bristol parks, drew an overflow crowd to city hall, where council chambers filled, an adjacent conference room filled and 80 people joined the meeting virtually. In addition, another 119 people emailed and another 40 called to voice their position on the issue. In the end, the Parks Commission voted to look into other means to control the geese population. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the issue of exterminating geese is not mute. The mayor, at the meeting after it was clear the commission would not be moving ahead with the plan, asked the commissioners to bring the topic and the plan up again on a monthly basis, which is interesting because the mayor chairs the commission, and the chair sets the agenda. It pretty much looks like the commission will be taking up the subject again.</p>

<p>And mid-afternoon Sunday, there will be the Bristol Brass and Wind Ensemble's Spring Pops Concert at Bristol Eastern High School, at 3 p.m. This is a special one, since it will be the final one for Rich Theriault, the ensemble's director for the past 15 years. The event is free, but donations are welcome.</p>

<p>Listening this week is an old favorite, the Gray Area podcast with Sean Illing, this one, "Fareed Zakaria on our revolutionary moment," featuring an in-depth conversation about the confluence of politics, artificial intelligence, the pace of change and the rise of illiberal democracy. It's a big discussion at a critical time that deserves attention. Click <a href="https://megaphone.link/VMP6278318056">here</a>.</p>

<p>As for reading, I have gone back to "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by historian and public intellectual Yuval Noah Harari. That title says a lot about the book. It covers a lot of territory in a relatively short space, 416 pages, but what pages. The way Harari captures ideas--I am guessing most of us are familiar with the details that have emerged in recent years about Neanderthals and Desovanians and Homo Sapiens living contemporaneously rather than one after the other--and the way Harari synthesizes these ideas and draws really thoughtful conclusions from them, is mind-blowing. Everyone should be exposed, not only to the topics but also to the manner in which the topics and information is handled.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
