<p>Naugatuck played solid defense and took advantage of five St. Paul errors to earn a 3-2 victory in Bristol Wednesday afternoon. Kevin Cestari got the win in relief. </p>

<p>Kyle Wilson was the hard luck loser for the Falcons, allowing only one unearned run in 2 and 1/3 innings of relief.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck scored the first run of the game without the benefit of a hit. Thomas Barry walked with one out and stole 2nd. With two outs, a routine fly ball was dropped in the outfield allowing Barry to score, and Naugatuck led 1-0.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul answered right back with two runs in the bottom of the first inning. Logan Rembish led off with a walk, and Jamie Leggett followed with a single. Rembish eventually scored on Cal Chance's SAC fly, and Leggett scored on a passed ball.</p>

<p>Although both teams put men on base in every inning, neither team could get a key hit to score a run until the top of the 5th. </p>

<p>Naugutuckâ€™s Barry led off with a walk and advanced to 2nd on Michael Deitelbaum's single. With one out, a successful double steal put two men in scoring position. Alex Teixeira singled home Barry, and the score was tied 2-2. A walk to Aiden Adanosky loaded the bases with one out, and Rembish's day on the mound was over. </p>

<p>Wilson came in to relieve Rembish, and retired the next 2 batters on a strikeout and a fly to right to limit the damage and keep the game tied at 2-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Paul loaded the bases on 3 walks in the bottom of the 6th, and that ended Andrew Tyska's day on the mound. Kevin Cestari came on in relief, and got the first batter that he faced to pop up to 2nd base to end the inning with no damage done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naugatuck got the final run of the game in the top of the 7th, again without the benefit of a base hit. Teixeira led off and reached on an infield error. A failed bunt attempt had Teixeira hung up between 1st and 2nd, but he was able to avoid the tag and slide into 2nd safely. After a routine groundout, Teixeira attempted to advance to 3rd. The throw to 3rd was wild and went out of bounds, and Teixeira scored what became the winning run.</p>
