<p>Water is shut off on Beths Avenue, and possibly the Marwood Condominiums, the Bristol Water and Sewer Departments announced earlier this morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Customers in surrounding area may experience periods of low water pressure. When the water is turned back, it may be discolored. If this happens, the department advises running an outside faucet or bathtub until the water runs clear. Run only cold water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A water filling station is located at the Water Filtration Plant and is available to any customers who are affected by an extended service interruption 24 hours a day/ 7 days a week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no charge to customers affected by the water service interruption. Customers will need to bring their own containers and Filtration Plant Operators will assist in filling them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Water Filtration Plant is located at 1080 Terryville Avenue and the number to the plant is (860) 583-6504. It would be appreciated if customers could call the plant in advance of at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bristolct.gov//AlertCenter.aspx?AID=308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.bristolct.gov//AlertCenter.aspx?AID=308</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
