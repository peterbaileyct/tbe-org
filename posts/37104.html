<p>A lifelong Bristol resident, he graduated from Bristol High School before serving in the United States Army.  Jack was known for his warm, friendly, positive, engaging spirit; and his casual, easy, joking style was a lifelong attribute.  </p>

<p>Jack was a career firefighter for the City of Bristol retiring as Deputy Chief in 1994. He often said he did not work a day in his life because of his joy of being a fireman. He considered his fellow firemen his extended family. Jack also worked at St. Joseph Cemetery for over 30 years.  </p>

<p>He was a big fan of the Red Sox, UConn basketball and Notre Dame football. In his home, he could always be located in his chair in the den, with a 700-page biography or a newspaper in his lap. Outside the home, Jack could be found puttering around in “his truck” going from one helping hand project to the next, or shuttling a relative somewhere. Jack was a parishioner of St. Gregory the Great Church for over 50 years and a regular at 7:30 am Sunday mass for most of that time.  </p>

<p>Jack regrettably leaves his wife Claire after nearly 68 blissful years of marriage; Claire and Jack were an inseparable team of parents, grandparents, and care givers for their extended family. Often providing a place to stay during interim periods that happens in life. Their shared generosity and caring was a constant source of comfort for their family.  </p>
