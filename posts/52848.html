<p>Dogs of all sizes and breeds dressed to impress from paws to tails in costumes including a butterfly, skunk, prisoner, spider, cow, a taco gog, a politician and even a Home Goods employee at Lake Compounce's annual Howl-ween Dog Costume Parade last weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some dogs came as Marvel and movie characters -- Wonder Woman, Beetlejuice, Woody, Pennywise and Dog Pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s great to see the awesome turnout of pups each year in their cute and scary costumes.” said Nachor Vincent, Lake Compounce sales and marketing representative and master of ceremonies for the lively dog and family-friendly event.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three at a time, the dogs, led by their owners, modeled their outfits on stage as Vincent introduced each dog to the audience. The onlookers voted for each dog by applause. Event coordinator Blake Braswell, senior manager entertainment and events, manned the sound meter to determine the winner of each round.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top three returned to the state for a final audience vote. Of the three -- Spunky, a svelte dachshund in a black and white striped prisoner outfit, Leo a Maltese as Woody from Toy Story, and Zero dressed as Dog Pool the Superhero sidekick in "Deadpool &amp; Wolverine" -- Zero, a 4-and-a-half-month-old Morkie claimed first prize. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His elaborate and convincing outfit included boots and a mask. Zero was named for the dog in Nightmare Before Christmas by his proud spooky-story loving owners Jonathan Sampt and Caida Sampt-Diaz from Watertown. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were already planning to go to the Phantom Fall Fest and found out we could bring him so we were very excited to participate and so surprised to win," said Sampt.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In second place winner was the prisoner-costumed 5-year-old Spunky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Spunky is the most adventurous of our three Dachshunds," said Heather, who along with her husband, Tom, are Spunky's owners. "He picked the prisoner suit."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mallons are from Prospect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His two other costume options were a dinosaur or a bee, but the prisoner outfit was the only one he didn’t shake off, according to Heather. She and her husband had their first date at Lake Compounce, and now enjoy season passes and regularly bringing their children. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our whole family is coming back on the 27th dressed as Winnie the Pooh characters,” said Heather about attending the last day of Phantom Fall Festival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jake, a 14-year-old Shepard mix, dressed as Pennywise did not win this year, but he was delighted to be a part of the festivities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He loved it so much, he didn’t want to leave the Park,” said co-owner Shannon Carvalho of Middletown. She and her boyfriend Matt Gilman took turns bringing Jake on stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We had our first date at Lake Compounce, and we wanted to share the special experience with Jake while we can.” said Carvalho. She wishes the park had more days they could bring Jake with them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over 30 dogs competed for big treats at the event, one of many Halloween themed activities at the Adventure Park’s “Fall Phantom Festival,” which ends this weekend. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The dog costume event and Pawliday Lights in December give folks the unique opportunity to bring their dogs into the park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Prizes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winners received combinations of season passes, tickets to Holiday Lights, and a doggy basket donated by Pet Supplies Plus with toys and treats. “Zero is enjoying his prizes,”&nbsp;said Sampt.</p>
