<p>The Bristol Police Department is investigating a hacking incident at City Hall involving a recent virtual downtown development workshop last Saturday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the meeting was underway, the hacker struck with a spewing of racist remarks, the N-word, F-bombs, and a drawing depicting a Swastika for everyone to see in person and online. The malicious activity lasted nearly a minute before Mayor Jeff Caggiano ordered the call cut. The meeting resumed later but for only those who were there in person.</p>

<p>Bristol Police Chief Brian Gould told the TBE that the matter is under investigation “Typically when a crime occurs in a public venue, and there are witnesses, complainants and victims, we will investigate accordingly.&nbsp; In this particular incident, the Mayor (Jeff Caggiano) did make prompt notification to me and requested a criminal investigation.”</p>

<p>Unwanted intrusions into video conferences are known as zoombombing, and internet trolls are usually the perpetrators. Cybercrimes are complex, and Chief Gould said it could take months to investigate thoroughly.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To date, neither the mayor nor any of the city councilors have gone on record via social media or at Tuesday’s council meeting to condemn or denounce the language and images portrayed in the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TBE editor Dave Fortier reached out to the mayor for comment Sunday, and he has yet to receive a response.</p>
