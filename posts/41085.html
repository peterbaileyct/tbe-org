<p>“Every season, no matter what, you’re going to have a game like that,” Eastern coach Bunty Ray said. “To come out with a win is better than coming out with a loss. I was not very happy with any part of the game today, but that just means the bar has been raised. That doesn’t mean these kids don’t have bigger expectations. They want to play better.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
