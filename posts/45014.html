<p>Come Sunday morning, a new grandchild will have joined three others. That would have been on Friday, when Mary was in session at the state capitol and I was sequestered at home, waiting for news about the birth, coming from one state over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mary and I texted each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Any word?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Nothing so far."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, the announcement coming in a text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Mom and baby are good. Everything went well. Will text more when they get settled in."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relief and gratitude followed, and a couple more texts between Mary and me, because no one shared the baby's name. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That came later along with photos and a phone call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, wonderful!</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, I had babysitting duty which brought me to Norwalk and the mess that was there after the tractor trailer accident on I-95 that erupted into a massive fire, damaging he highway and an overpass. I don't know what I was thinking--maybe I wasn't--but I thought I might avoid the area, and still I got caught in the middle of traffic, spending literally hours navigating a couple of miles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Saturday evening, Gov. Lamont announced that traffic in the northbound lane would be opened by 8 p.m. The southbound lane would be closed through Sunday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we have in Bristol the Bristol Chorale performing at the Rockwell Theater on Memorial Boulevard and Forestville's Duck Race. On Shrub Road, there is the grand opening of the Wallace Barnes Accessible Nature Trail at 2 p.m. this afternoon.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listening this week, there is more on Trump v. United States. For the latest audio and a transcript, consult the Supreme Court website by clicking <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">here</a>. Scroll down the page to the box where the case is featured and choose your delivery method.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there are the student protests and their coverage that has become a subject of its own. The Majority Report podcast provides an alternative discussion from an eye-opening perspective -- that we are not getting the whole story about the protesters, who have been, for the most part, peaceful. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"3331--Propaganda, Protest, &amp; Politics w/Mehdi Hassan" (click <a href="https://youtu.be/m-gYldpOHNc">here</a>) begins the discussion. I recommend listening to it and following up with the podcast Ones &amp; Tooze, "The Columbia Protests and the Economics of Divestment," which provides addition insights but requires paying careful attention to absorb the context. Click <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-columbia-protests-and-the-economics-of-divestment/id1584397047?i=1000654438337">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: In this Ones &amp; Tooze segment reviewing university endowments, The University of Connecticut is brought up as an example of how an esteemed public university works compared to private, such as Columbia and Yale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On another note, ff you haven't got to it, I highly recommend Ones &amp; Tooze's "Famine in Gaza," available by clicking <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/famine-in-gaza/id1584397047?i=1000652241163">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for reading, there is the Jewish Forward, which has articles and commentary about the protests and the situation in Israel. Click <a href="https://forward.com/">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On a different subject, you might try this article from The New York Review of Books, "Choosing Pragmatism Over Textualism: A method of judicial interpretation that looks only to the original meaning of legal texts risks producing a Constitution and laws that no one would want," by former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
