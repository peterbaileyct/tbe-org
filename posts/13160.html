<p>BRISTOL – A week before its crosstown battle against Bristol Central, the Bristol Eastern and Berlin boys track and field teams duked it out from Alumni Field on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a busy meet, there wasn’t a winner but there wasn’t a loser either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a rare feat, the Lancers and Redcoats battled to a 75-75 stalemate as Eastern hasn’t dropped a meet since mid-April.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several athletes tallied first place finishes for Eastern including Logan Crowley, taking victory over four different events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowley won the 1600 meters in five minutes flat while in the 800, he pulled out a time of 2:08.18 over another impressive finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also won the 3200 meters in 10:58.7 while making up part of the winning 4x800 relay team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crowley joined up with Dominic Tartarelli, Aidan Tartarelli, and Jack Mulcunry to nab the win in 8:47.7.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carter Harris also had a day for the home squad from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris won the 400 meters (51.84 seconds), nabbed the winning mark in the pole vault (10 feet, six inches), and helped the 4x400 relay squad to victory as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team of Mulcunry, Edward Ansah, Preston Poirier, and Harris won the 4x400 relay event in 3:41.13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Lancers, Isaiah Lawrence-Bynum took the triple jump (40 feet, 7.25 inches), Jaiden Fore’s toss of 115 feet, five inches helped him win the javelin and Joshua Moore earned first place in the 110 hurdles (17.2 seconds).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That stalemate, which was a very good showing against the program from Berlin, sets up Eastern’s huge meet next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, May 17, Eastern battles Bristol Central in a CCC South extravaganza – starting at 3:45 p.m. from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be a battle as the Rams will enter the bout a perfect 6-0 on the campaign, looking to win the CCC South championship with a perfect ledger if the program can upend the Lancers.</p>
