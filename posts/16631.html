<p>His favorite hobbies were making his homemade wine, fishing and his garden. Up until his last days he was still pulling weeds and making sure it was watered. You may also see his handy work around Bristol, he built several stone walls. He was a mason worker by trade and was proud to always show us his work. He “played” the harmonica and sang to his grandchildren and great grandchildren.</p>
