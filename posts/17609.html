<p>FAIRFIELD - The Connecticut High School Football Alliance pitted Bristol Eastern against Fairfield Warde on Friday evening, a squad the Lancers simply could not slow down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The FCIAC East competitor scored off the bat and then on the flip side, clamped down on Eastern defensively - holding the locals to just one touchdown score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the depleted Lancers ended up falling by a 27-7 final from Tetreau/Davis Field in Fairfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Undefeated Warde, now 3-0, saw standout QB Charlie Gulbin (19-of-24, 283 yards) make connections all over the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mix of play action kept the gridiron wide open, and Gulbin was able to find of host of receivers after Eastern (0-3) forced late down situations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still dealing with an injury to Lancers’ signal caller Kamden Laprise, back-up Alexander Corvo did a credible job hanging in, squaring away 12-of-19 passes for just over 100 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rayshon Andrews captured over 100 yards from scrimmage, snaring seven passes for 83 yards while making three rushes for 20 yards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jaiden Fore (21 carries, 94 yards) did another credible job moving the football on the ground while Austin Shorette - playing well on both sides of the ball - made a 10-yard touchdown reception for the team’s only touchdown of the evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shorette led the defense with 7.5 tackles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Babin made three receptions while on defense, Zaveyn Tate was a stud - scooping in three tackles for losses while collecting seven tackles overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joseph Gibson tallied Eastern’s first sack of the campaign and did everything he could to slow a very aggressive offensive onslaught by the crafty Mustangs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warde scored on its opening drive, going 65 yards on 12 plays which was capped when Gulbin made a 12-yard charge into the end zone as the home team led 7-0 just five minutes in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern forced a turnover on the Mustangs’ second drive with the ball and off a slick 49-yard punt by kicker Gavin Damboise, Warde had to traverse nearly the length of the field to score again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, a slick six play, 91-yard jaunt saw Gulbin make a 37-yard pass to Gerald Jacobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tate did a credible job tracking the receiver, but Jacobs was already a step or two in front, sprinting in the goal for six more points as Fairfield led 14-0 with 7:28 remaining in the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an Eastern three-and-out, Warde scored on the ensuing drive as Gulbin dumped down a pass to Jacobs for an 8-yard TD strike and with 2:59 remaining in the second frame, it was a 20-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That score carried into intermission and off an onside kick to open the third tilt, Warde had possession of the ball and scored one last time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring, Gulbin made a great toss to Lucas Coleman who made an equally tough reception over the Eastern defender and on the 25-yard scoring connection, the Mustangs were in charge at 27-0 with 10:21 showing on the clock in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Corvo, who is more than holding his own as the starting QB, helped to orchestrate a 79 yard, 13 play drive - including a big 10-yard fourth down reception by Babin - as Shorette eventually notched Eastern’s touchdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under fire, Corvo made a smooth toss to Shorette - all alone in the middle of the end zone - as the 10-yard touchdown strike trimmed the deficit to 27-7 with 2:56 left in the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither team scored again the rest of the way as Eastern eventually absorbed a tough 27-7 decision.</p>
