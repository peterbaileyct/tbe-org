<p><em>We never truly lose those that pass on.  Their physical presence may leave us, but the heart and the love are not gone, even in death.  It is natural to mourn, but our sadness will be replaced with a presence which is so much still vibrant and full of life, even when she can’t be seen. </em></p>

<p>Lillian was a sister of the late Robert Gorton and late Verna Mitchell and is survived by sister Betty Abita of Mineola, Fla. Lillian was the companion of the late William Donovan with whom she spent time rooting for the Huskies in person or TV. After graduating from (Scranton) High School, Lillian moved to Waterbury Conn., where she met the love of her life, Bob, at a local dance. She married in 1947, moved to Bristol and spent the next 50 years together living, loving and laughing and raising their three children.  Lillian worked at Bradlees, D&amp;L and Crazy Bruce’s from which she retired at age 80.  </p>

<p>She enjoyed dancing to big band music, playing Bingo and taking day trips to visit family and friends. Lillian was a home-body and a meticulous housekeeper. She maintained her home on Shagbark Drive in such a spotless condition by herself, even her caregivers and home health aides couldn’t keep up!</p>
