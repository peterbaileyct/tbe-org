<p>Voting deadlines and registration dates for this year's presidential primary on Tuesday, April 2, are nearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's brand new for everyone," said Kevin McCauley, one of Bristol's two registrars. "Presidential primaries in Bristol historically have been low turnout. With that you may not find any lines."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, voters will be dealing with people coming to city hall for everyday transactions, he added, so it's good to take that into consideration. Parking is available on both the North Main Street and Laurel Street entrances. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following are on the Democratic primary ballot: Joe Biden, Dean Phillips. Cenk Uygur and <br>Marianne Williamson.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those on the Republican primary ballot include the following: Ryan Binkley, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol, early voting is being held in the city council chambers at city hall on Tuesday, March 26, Wednesday, March 27, Thursday, March 28 and Saturday, March 30, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unaffiliated voters may change their affiliation to participate in early voting by enrolling as either a Democrat or a Republican by Monday, March 25 before noon in person at registrar's office on the ground floor of city hall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who have not registered and who would like to participate in early voting need to file a voter registration application for one of the two parties holding a primary with the registrar by noon on the business day before the day they plan to vote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, the deadline for first-time registration to vote in person is April 1 by noon at the registrar's office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the April 2 primary, there is one change in polling places--those who voted at Bristol Elks Club will now be voting at the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
