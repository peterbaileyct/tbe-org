<p>Once again, the ShopRite State Nutmeg Games have rolled around and that means a trio of sisters from Bristol are in action on the ice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carol, Jennifer, and Jilleen Sugrue - sisters from Bristol - took the Newington Arena rink by storm this past Saturday at the 2022 games - representing the Mum City with some simply incredible performances in the ice skating competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all three sisters are successful student athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like she does on the ice, Carol is tearing it up in the classroom at the University of Hartford - majoring in Prosthetics and Orthotics, a specialty at UHART.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’ll graduate as a member of the Class of 2025.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenny will be a senior at Bristol Central this year while youngest sister, Jilleen, is in sixth grade, attending St. Joe’s in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She played for the Gators minors' team for Bristol Girls Little League Softball this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And of course, all three sisters are skating phenoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trio competed at different skating levels from the Nutmeg Games and according to their father John, they have all enjoyed a very successful skating season in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A very proud father also enjoys watching his daughters compete in the sport - especially during the summer months which means more time indoors and away from the hot sun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That Newington Arena is a nice place to cool off and spectate,” said John Surge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Serious competition</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ice skating portion of the Nutmeg State Games is sponsored by the Finer Edge Figure Skating Club - the program the Sugrue sisters performs with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The competitors were judged using the IJS System, a method of scoring that’s based on cumulative points rather than the 6.0 standard scoring system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Nutmeg State Games website, “Well-balanced juvenile through senior events will be judged using the IJS System.&nbsp; All other events will be judged under the 6.0 Majority Judging System. There will not be final rounds for any events.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Judges were scoring on the qualities of each performance and the Sugrue crew showed plenty of ability, effort and heart on the ice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday ended up being extremely busy for the hardworking sisters as the competition began for the athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Carol and Jennifer each won one event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carol came through with the win in the Junior Women FS (Free Skate) as her score of 65.14 was the winning mark in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 11 Junior Women SP (Short Program), Carol nabbed third place with an overall score of 33.70.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A gold and a bronze were an impressive haul.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 10 Novice Women SP, Jennifer won the event with a score of 27.58.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also scored second place in the 26 Novice Women FS, squaring away a score of 47.66.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A gold and a silver medal proved Jennifer was one of the top skaters in Newington that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Jilleen captured fifth place in the 130 Basic 6 Girls program as the Sugrue sisters continue to dominate the ice over a very tough sport.</p>
