<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central baseball team has reloaded a bit in 2023 and behind a tremendous pitching staff, the Rams will be looking to make a little noise this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All-Stater Frank Spirito IV is looking for a big senior campaign before heading off for the University of Connecticut and expect him to be one of the featured arms of the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head coach Bunty Ray returns most of the squad from last season’s state tournament contender and if the offense and defense can get into sync, Central is certainly going to have a very good campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to expect from Central this spring:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL CENTRAL BASEBALL</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head coach</strong>: Bunty Ray (16th season)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Overall Record</strong>: In 15 seasons as the coach of the Bristol Central baseball program, Ray holds an all-time record of 208-114.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2022 season</strong>: 9-12 overall. No. 22 Bristol Central lost its first round Class L game against No. 11 Woodstock Academy, 4-3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Key Losses</strong>: JT Clark, Bryan Capezzone, Zach Vanasse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch</strong>: Frank Spirito IV (sr, P/3B), Ryan Ring (sr, C), Aiden Lopez (so, LF/P), Mike McMahon (jr, 2B), Michael Allan (sr, SS, Captain), Nate Pirog (jr, P), Tim Sample (So, UTL), Jack Bellantuano (sr, DH), Christian Stafford (sr, 3B), Joe Mauriello (jr, OF), Anthony Santilli (jr, RF), Nick Krompegal (sr, P), Rocco Spirito (so, C), Mason Allan (so, INF), Oscar Kuzniar (jr, P), Joe Gratta (jr, CF, transfer from Southington), Ty Davis (jr, P, transfer from St. Paul Catholic).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2023 Season Outlook</strong>: Ray&nbsp;has some ability all over the field, but it starts with the arms on the mound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s coming from numerous sources as the grouping of juniors Nate Pirog and Oscar Kuzniar, along with Spirito, will be the heart of the rotation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sophomore Aiden Lopez (left field), senior Nick Krompegal and St. Paul Catholic transfer, junior Ty Davis, who saw time on the Falcons’ championship squad from last season, will also provide depth on the hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our strength is always going to be on the mound,” said Ray. “We haven’t had this deep a pitching staff [in quite some time], anchored by Frank. But the rest of these guys have gotten bigger and stronger. They’ll keep us in games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still UConn bound,&nbsp;Spirito – one of four captains for the Rams this season – is the man on Central’s squad and will also play in the infield when he’s not striking out opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He can chuck the ball upwards of 90 MPH and includes a slick changeup and a slider in his array of pitching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito has displayed Division I ability from the start and that effort will be displayed on the mound and at the plate this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s a frontline player,” said Ray of Spirito. “He was an All-State player as a junior. He obviously is a horse. Last year, we used him in different roles, mostly as a closer so we have to maximize what he can do. But with this pitching staff, I plan on starting him and also use him in relief situations on off days.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For the most part, we’re going to give him the ball every four/fifth day and hope he keeps us in the game. Obviously with pitch counts and everything else, we have to watch what he’s doing but we have some guys that can pick him up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year’s captains include Spirito, Christian Stafford (senior, third base), Mike Allan (senior, shortstop) and Ryan Ring – the veteran catcher of the bunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ring is a senior who has a vast amount of experience catching for the group of chuckers over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he also has a stick to match whether it’s batting at clean-up or wherever Ray slots him in the lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve trusted him with the pitching staff,” said Ray of Ring. “He’s done a great job, a character kid teams kind of get behind. It’s good to see him right now in the role he’s in. He’s very confident, enjoying himself and he’s really grown into the position and grown into the leadership role.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford and Allan bring defense into the fold&nbsp;along the infield and it’s that defense Ray and company wants to see improvement from over last season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in the preseason, the offense has been a positive from the get-go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was pleasantly surprised with the line-up in the preseason,” said Ray. “Defensively, we have some work to do but they’re coming around. But to be honest with you offensively, we’re much bigger and stronger top to bottom. There’s some speed mixed in.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Ray is looking forward to seeing two talented junior transfers hit the field as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with Davis, Southington transfer Joe Gratta comes to the Mum City ready to contribute in centerfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also has a little speed as well and could develop into a solid player at the top of Ray’s batting order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Gratta gives us a little different element,” said Ray of his centerfielder. “He is a very good defensive outfielder. Being at the top of the lineup, he provides a little bit of power and has shown some things in the preseason.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And everybody else worked really hard to improve.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Kuzniar, who will be one of the top pitchers on the squad, has improved offensively as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he can get things going from the dish, Central has the ability to pile up runs on the board very quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kuzniar has been a pleasant surprise in the offseason in terms of pitching and being a leader,” said Ray. “Obviously, everybody else has kind of stepped up. I’m really happy and pleased on how we’re progressing.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other contributors include sophomore Tim Sample (utility), senior Jack Bellantuano (DH), junior Joe Mauriello (outfield), junior Anthony Santilli (right field), and sophomores Rocco Spirito and Mason Allan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The graduated JT Clark was injured for a chunk of last season and while he made it back to the fold, the senior just didn’t have enough time to fully get his rhythm at the plate which hurt offensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this squad wants to be healthy out of the gate and get into the flow offensively quickly as the CCC grind starts immediately. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Offense is going to be key for us,” said Ray. “Pitching and defense is always number one but scoring runs, last year, that was the biggest downfall for our team. We pitched and played enough defense. We made some mistakes but towards the back-half of the season, we started 2-7, we just improved that whole second half of the season to get into the state tournament and have great tournament games.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Offensively, that’s where it hurt us…now, the lineup top to bottom can do some things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CCC South Outlook</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, Platt and Lewis Mills won the South with 6-1 ledgers and both programs can’t be underestimated.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was the unexpected Class L state tournament run by Maloney, all the way to the finals.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray also knows that Berlin is always a favorite in the CCC South and, per usual, the league will see a ton of parity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think the South is already tough,” said Ray. “Last year, Lewis Mills was good. Mills and Platt were co-champions, but Maloney went to the state final. Maloney returns a lot, Mills has some good players. Berlin is Berlin, you’re never going to count them out. I don’t know if there’s an easy out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ray also cautions that crosstown rival Bristol Eastern is a contender and not to underestimate the squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Eastern returns some people,” said Ray. “[Eastern head coach Steve Gaudet] has some pieces there. It’s baseball. On any given day, whether your pitching lines up, there’s a factor. Every day, you’ve got to play. In the Tier-II schedule, we’re playing the top-half of the CCC which is a good conference. I’m really looking forward in competing in it.”</p>
