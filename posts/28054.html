<p>Who was the person that seemed to be always happy, laughing and causing all sorts of havoc on the bench when the Bristol Central softball team was up at the plate?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was senior softball standout Kaley Laird, the Rams’ tremendous shortstop who was – along with fellow seniors Sophia Torreso, Lorelei Stancavage and Adrianna Lubrico – the heart and soul of the BCHS program over the last couple years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hayes has described Laird as someone “full of energy” multiple times (girls basketball coach Steve Gaudet has echoed the same) and when Laird took the court or field for one of the programs at Central, it was easy to see why.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’d talked to teammates, coaches and even a referee or two along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That competitive spirit was only matched by a couple athletes at BCHS over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there’s the athlete background to match, leading to the All-State recognition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Positively positive</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laird just gives off such tremendous vibes, it’s probably difficult to be down or upset around her for long.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s absolutely just so positive and for what the kid has gone through, it would probably take an army to knock her down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then she’d probably jump right back up, talking some trash or blasting a couple cheers in remarkable fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was no slowing down this senior and defensively, was there a better shortstop in the league than Laird?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find one as she attacked every ground ball with zest. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That defensive in the infield helped the program go 23-3, a school record for wins in a season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what team exactly slowed her down?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Southington in the CCC Tournament finals, she tallied three hits off Southington’s elite pitching staff.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then to be named All-State at shortstop, when will all the accolades end? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She proved that softball was bigger than life for the outstanding Laird and if you didn’t know, you probably completely missed her thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatments because she was always here, there, and everywhere – never really missing time in basketball or softball in term of games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adversity isn’t something that phases Laird in the least.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even the volleyball team used her energy this past fall as Laird was on the bench for every game, cheering the Rams all the way to the Class L title game as the program’s number one fan.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her effort and energy kept Central in the top-10 poll in softball all season, helping the program finish No. 7 overall when the final tally was compiled.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ECSU bound off a tremendous career</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern Connecticut State University is going to get a good one this fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The leadoff hitter of the Bristol Central lineup always found a way to get on base and her numbers were off the charts from the leadoff position.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She batted over .300 for the season, stole several bases with her quickness and agility, and never minded advancing a base or two if the defense fell asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, ECSU’s opponents are going to have to deal with the ability, and clever antics, of Laird in the field or on the bench.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Warriors were an outstanding 29-12 this past season, going to the NCAA Division III Eastern Regional – earning a 4-1 victory over Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This squad also achieved in the classroom, carrying an overall GPA of 3.67 – identifying that these athletes also accomplish tremendous feats when also hitting the books.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a situation Laird will certainly thrive in. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Always talking&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the great things when watching Laird perform is the entertainment value.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If she’s not leading cheers from the pine, Laird is out in the field talking and chatting – well – nearly non-stop.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Pomperaug, Laird stopped a speeding grounder from going into left field and after the throw over to first, she yelled to no one in particular, “My hand is tingling!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a strikeout by Torreso, Laird was chirping, “Ring that bell!” which was after one of her famous bathroom breaks she takes at just about every game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when not going number one (or possibly two), Laird is dancing around shortstop to a beat only she can hear.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the famous Dick Clark were still around, he’d have Laird guess star on ‘American Bandstand’ (look it up, youngsters).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Simply tremendous&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you blink, you’ve probably missed Laird who truly is a blur in motion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She seemingly makes every right play, putting the throw-over from shortstop right on the money and is a big student of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, the playing ability was always there and there’s no questioning her glove on the field, but it was the leadership component that puts her over the top.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To earn All-State is a testament to everything she’s had to endure in life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When life threw lemons at her, she not only made lemonade, but she took the leftovers and chucked them right back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is absolutely no stopping her and when she finally hits the softball field at ESCU, a whole new group of players, coaches and fans will be in for an extreme treat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopefully, there will be a bathroom near the field, and the Class L All-Stater won’t need any more golf cart escorts for a quick break.</p>
