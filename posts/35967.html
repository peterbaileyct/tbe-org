<p>The season for the Bristol Central girls soccer program might as well resemble a rollercoaster as the months of September and October have been wild and wacky for the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a 0-5 start -- a stretch that saw the Rams outscored 11-2 -- Central, under head coach Vicki Malick, has rebounded quite nicely since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals won four straight matches, then posted another two triumphs in a row before dropping a tough 2-1 decision to Lewis Mills from the turf field at BCHS on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mills, currently near the top of the CCC South standings, improved to 10-2-1 overall and is just a point behind division leading Berlin (16 points overall).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sadie Greaves notched the lone goal for the Rams as the program fell to 6-7 overall - just like their male counterparts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kate Schmidt and Layla Ljubuncic each scored goals for the victors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The streak</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has now won six of eight matches and all the victories have been by shutout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are the scores from all those recent wins:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Oct. 4, 3-0 victory versus East Hartford</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Oct. 8, 5-0 win versus Bristol Eastern</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Oct. 9, 6-0 triumph versus Windsor</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Oct. 11, 5-0 effort versus New Britain</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a close 3-2 loss to Middletown on Oct. 13, the Rams roasted Platt (7-0, Oct. 16) and Plainville (2-0, Oct. 17) in back-to-back games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before the regular season ends, Central -- behind captains Francesca Amara and Abigail Hansen -- wants to crawl to .500, or better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The remainder of the schedule</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central could eclipse .500 with wins against an array of upcoming opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, Plainville invades the turf at BCHS at 6 p.m. and then on Thursday, itâ€™s the big one as Central makes its way to Bristol Eastern for a crosstown thriller from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is 5 p.m. and the rematch should be a good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, on Monday, Oct. 30, a trip to Avon is in order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Falcons are the toughest opponent remaining on the schedule -- record wise -- as the team is 9-3 entering this week.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
