<p>Howard was an avid golfer who began caddying at the Torrington Country Club at the age of 10. He became a very good golfer who had three career holes-in-one. He was a 40-year member of the Pequabuck Golf Club where he had many great times. He also enjoyed worshipping the sun whether on the beach or in his yard. He spent many days in his chair just watching the people go by. He was a huge Brooklyn Dodger fan until their departure from New York and after a few years he eventually began rooting for the rival Yankees. He was also a big New York Giants fan which occupied his Sunday afternoons.</p>
