<p>Mike’s greatest passion was music. He was a talented guitar player, and shared that love with his nieces and nephews, by teaching them or accompanying them on performances. He attended hundreds of concerts over the years and has an enormous collection of CDs from his favorite artists. </p>

<p>He was also an avid cyclist, and logged thousands of miles riding his bike throughout Connecticut. As a young adult, he was a motorcycle enthusiast. He rode and restored a Kawasaki motorcycle that won many awards at local auto shows. It was his most prized possession.</p>

<p>He is survived by his brothers Timothy Seleman of Bristol, Thomas Seleman and his wife Leah of Harwinton; sisters Teri Seleman of Bristol and Mary Lynn Gagnon and her husband Gary of Bristol. He was a favorite uncle to his nieces and nephews, Mitch Gagnon and his wife Morgan, Grace Gagnon, Marissa Brevetti, River Seleman and Rachel Takeman and her husband Justin and their daughter Ada. When they were younger, he was like the Pied Piper and all the kids gravitated toward him at family gatherings. Everyone needs an Uncle Mike in their life.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
