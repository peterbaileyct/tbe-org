<p>The Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP has been around since the 1960s. While the local branch had been working to ensure that political, educational, social and economic equality was achieved for all individuals in the local community, it was given a new energy and formally reorganized in 1985. That effort was spearheaded by many community members and pastors, including&nbsp;Reverend Dr. Eddie C. Whitehead. To honor his legacy and to continue their mission of advancing&nbsp;educational opportunities, the Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP established the&nbsp;Reverend Dr. Eddie C. Whitehead of Bristol CT – Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship Fund at Main Street Community Foundation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first awards from this Fund will be granted this spring. Two $500 scholarships are available to graduating high school seniors&nbsp;from&nbsp;Bristol, Burlington, Harwinton, Plainville, Plymouth and Southington&nbsp;who are&nbsp;pursuing higher education at a&nbsp;college, university or vocational/technical institution.</p>

<p>Applications are being accepted through March 11, 2022.&nbsp;To view all eligibility criteria and requirements, and to apply for the scholarship, visit&nbsp;the&nbsp;Foundation website,&nbsp;<a href="x-apple-ql-id://6BE5A585-ECDE-488E-883F-741060CEF851/x-apple-ql-magic/www.mainstreetfoundation.org">www.mainstreetfoundation.org</a>.</p>

<p>The Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP has awarded scholarships to local students in the past, but&nbsp;“partnering with Main Street Community Foundation allows this scholarship to now be permanent,” said Eric Clemons, President of the Greater&nbsp;Bristol Branch of the NAACP. “This fund was created so the Greater Bristol Branch of the NAACP could create a legacy for the communities&nbsp;we serve.&nbsp;At the same time, we remember the efforts of men and women like Dr. King and Pastor Whitehead, whose dreams to insure educational opportunities and equity will now live through this fund forever.”</p>
