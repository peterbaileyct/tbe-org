<p>The United States will mark the 250th anniversary of its founding in 2026, and a small group gathered at the Bristol Historical Society Thursday night to discuss and develop, a plan for Bristol. It was the second meeting in as many months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lee McFadden, Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution 250 anniversary chair, solicited ideas and navigated the group through the process. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McFadden said she pictures a yearlong event locally, with it peaking on July 4, 2026. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It would be very difficult to maintain energy. Not just the people that are working it but the community too," she told the group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No central theme emerged Thursday, but attendees discussed ideas for an overarching one and how it could be incorporated and implemented into city events in 2026 by Bristol’s stakeholders such as museums, civic groups, nonprofits, the business community and others. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike other celebrations, a program with representation that is cross-cultural and cross-generational is sought not only as part of the theme but also in the planning process as well. Efforts are being made to reach out to those groups and organizations over the next month. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Included with that is telling some of Bristol's told and untold stories from underrepresented communities and those who built Bristol. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another group they want involved is Bristol schools and students. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Town historian Tom Dickau told the group<em> </em>that during the dedication of Bristol' World War I monument, Bristol students were not allowed to attend because the ceremony took place during school hours, so they came up with an alternative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Each school did something simultaneously at the same time the monument was being dedicated. One sang patriotic songs, another one read a list of the people who were deceased during World War I, and another wrote poems.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Across the country, plans are being made to celebrate the United States' 250th anniversary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Boston, there will be reenactments, retrospectives and the dumping of tea into the Boston Harbor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The state of Nebraska plans to promote underrepresented groups during the American Revolution which includes, women, American Indians and person of color. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, in Connecticut, Simsbury held its first meeting on Jan. 11, and Litchfield has tentative plans for a three-to four-year celebration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thursday's meeting lasted a little more than an hour. The next meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 22 at the Bristol Historical Society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Anyone interested in being involved is encouraged to attend. For information, contact Lee McFadden via email at <a href="mailto:lee@gomcf.com">lee@gomcf.com</a>.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
