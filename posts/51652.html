<p>The Bristol Central Cross Country teams competed in the Wickham Invitationals in Manchester on Saturday, and they continued to show growth and improvement as they have all season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Coach Tamara Stafford stated, “It was great to be back at the Wickham Invite after it was canceled due to weather last year. Our boys team is definitely starting to step up. Sophomores Naythan and Noah Pellerin continue to come up big for us at the front and our pack of 3-6/7 is looking stronger each week.”<br><br>The Girls team is extremely young, so only one of the Ram girls ran in the varsity race. Stafford commented, “Our girls team is young and working hard and we’ve kept all but one in the JV races at invitationals. The goal is to move some of them up to the varsity race at the CCC Championship meet.”</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
