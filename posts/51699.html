<p>Generations of Bristol residents filled Memorial Boulevard to celebrate the 62nd Annual Bristol Mum Festival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The festivities commenced Friday night under clear skies with the “Hometown Heroes” opening ceremonies. This year’s honorees were members of the Bristol Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), with Fire Chief Richard Hart serving as the 2024 festival Grand Marshal.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Truly humbled and honored to be given this title as Grand Marshal of the Mum Festival Parade,” said Hart. “Thank you so much to the Exchange Club and the Mum Festival Committee for putting on such a fantastic event.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The beloved community event spanning from Friday night through Sunday, brought a weekend filled with food, live music, arts and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recognition of the Hometown Heroes, the Mum Festival Committee provided free cupcakes and homemade punch to attendees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The cupcakes are a way to celebrate CERT, our Hometown Heroes,” Donna Dognin said. “As chair of the Hometown Heroes Committee, I’m honored to acknowledge them and Grand Marshal Chief Hart.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The evening continued with performances by singer-songwriter Faith Rheault, who entertained the crowd with an eclectic mix of original songs and pop favorites. Following her set, the Billy Joel tribute band River of Dreams had festivalgoers singing and dancing to classics like “Uptown Girl.”</p>

<p>The midway buzzed with activity as younger attendees enjoyed carousel rides, Funhouse antics, and carnival games. The sweet aroma of traditional carnival fare; candy apples, fried Oreos, and popcorn filled the air, tempting guests to indulge in their favorite treats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have a lot of great food this year,” vendor relations director Andy Adams said. “23 food trucks and booths along with our Bristol Blues and Brew Beer tent. There’s something for everyone. We also have 130 vendors, great bands, actives and programs”</p>

<p>The enticing array of culinary options included local favorite Food Trucks such as Dem Boyz Grill &amp; Catering, Grandma Lil’s, Ted’s Steamed Cheeseburgers and Spot on Tacos, with a diverse selection ranging from fried chicken and hotdogs to clam chowder and baked stuffed potatoes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For me, it’s all about the food,” said Deb Miller, “the more the merrier. I mean, I can get tacos and pierogies then a loaded baked potato. I haven’t even thought about desert yet, but it’s probably going to be a candy apple because I loved them as a kid.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday's activities engaged festivalgoers of all ages. Children enjoyed interactions with costumed characters and petting friendly farm animals at the petting zoo. Popular activities included hayrides, pony rides, and pumpkin painting in the kid zone. The annual Classic Car Show at the BAIMS parking lot attracted a record crowd, featuring over 200 classic cars.</p>

<p>As the sun set, hundreds gathered near the main stage to see headliner band Soul Sound Revue. The Motown tribute band performed energetic covers from Hall of Fame artists including Smokey Robinson, The Temptations and Stevie Wonder.</p>

To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
