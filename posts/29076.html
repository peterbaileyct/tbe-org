<p>MIDDLETOWN – For the second straight game, the Bristol American Legion 17U team squared off against a very familiar opponent in postseason play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a tough 10-run loss at the hands of Torrington on Monday, Post 2 butted heads against Farmington in an elimination game from Pat Kidney Field in Middletown on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the third meeting of the summer between the two Zone 3 programs and just as the weather was going to make play impossible for the remainder of the day, Farmington was able to squeeze out a 4-0 victory over Bristol – eliminating the locals from state tournament play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol ended the campaign at 13-11 overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The threat of rain loomed over the game the entire outing, but two efficient pitchers did a tremendous job leading the charge, getting out of the innings with a little zest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Against Farmington (16-8), Post 2 got men on base more than a time or two but just couldn’t put together a big hit to cash those runners in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The kids played hard,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of his squad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 chucker Jonathan Montgomery hung in the entire time, throwing a complete game – allowing only six hits and keeping the opponents off-balanced over most of the encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Credit Farmington’s Neerad Narasimhan as his defense made several big plays each and every time the squad faced a little heat, the victors did just enough to wiggle out of the jams.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery was perfect through one frame but in the second stanza, Farmington went for three big runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arie Deluca singled and eventually advanced to third base via two groundouts, scoring on a base hit by Samuel Paye Baker to make it a 1-0 contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Justin Kinney followed with a base-on-balls and with men on first and second, Tyler Finn blasted a long single to center – clearing the bases – and when Kinney slid into the dish safely, it was a 3-0 game through two completed innings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start the third, Bristol’s Gavin Colvin absolutely crushed a ball to left field that was eventually tracked down, nearly clearing the fence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The visitors eventually broke their hitless streak later in the third frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two away,&nbsp;Steve Lodge dropped a one hopper into center and Gabe White followed with a slick flare to left as two runners were on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Molinsky, who was robbed of a hit during his at-bat, flew out to left as the ball was just scooped in by the fielder and Farmington kept its 3-0 lead intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Caleb’s ball would have made it 3-2,” said LaPenta if Molinsky’s ball fell in for a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the top of the fourth, Bristol’s Brian Grabowski opened the inning with a single but got caught stealing second to keep the squad off the scoreboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol turned a sweet 6-4-3 double play to snuff out a Farmington rally in the bottom of the tilt and heading into the fifth, Post 2 was still hanging around – trailing just 3-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luke Colfer slammed a double by the fielder in center with two outs in the fifth, but Lodge fell via strikes as Farmington kept its shutout intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 turned another double play in the fifth to keep the home team off the board as Bristol’s defense was taking center stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol took another shot at it in the sixth as Grabowski reached base on an error and when Stevens drew the squad’s first walk, Brayden Schenck was at the dish with ducks on the pound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His offering to left, which looked destined to drop, was chased down and caught as Farmington maintained all of its 3-0 edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Brayden’s ball” could have fallen in said LaPenta of Schenck’s shot. “I thought we hit the ball pretty good.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth with two away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Grosso walked, and Jake Percival blasted a long triple to right as the lead runner scored, allowing Farmington to nab a 4-0 cushion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as the weather was about to turn ugly, Narasimhan and the defense made it a 1-2-3 seventh as Farmington defeated Post 2 by four runs – advancing in postseason play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winning a state championship in Connecticut is difficult with all the twists and turns of a long postseason road.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give Bristol some credit, making its way out of its pod after dropping its first game and qualifying for the elite eight – taking its shot against some of the state’s top programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They just made a couple more plays than we did,” said LaPenta of Farmington.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
