<p>Connecticut State Police investigating the shooting of the three Bristol officers have not released any information about a potential motive for the shooting. They have only said that the 911 call may have been a hoax to lure the officers to the home.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The alleged shooter Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was killed during the incident and his brother Nathan Brutcher, 32, was wounded, state police said. Police have not said, however, who shot them. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the elder Brutcher was reportedly upset about an argument that night at Bleachers Bar, on Middle Street. The sources say that he was issued a summons for a disturbance in the bar. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After both brothers returned home, sources say Nicholas grabbed his gun and possibly wanted to return to the bar. Nathan attempted to stop him and was possibly shot in the scuffle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, according to sources, Nicholas then called 911 reporting a domestic dispute and lay in wait outside for the police to arrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the shootout, Nicholas, shot and killed Officer Alex Hamzy, 34, and Sgt. Dustin Demonte, and was in turn wounded, and then according to sources, may have shot himself.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nathan Brutcher remains hospitalized with no announcement of his condition. </p>

<p>The Connecticut State Police are conducting the investigation. They have said the investigation is complex and is still in its preliminary stages, leaving exactly what happened still unknown.&nbsp;</p>
