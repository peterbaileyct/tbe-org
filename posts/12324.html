<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team is off and running this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Friday afternoon, the Kingstreeters took Alumni Field by storm for the first time in 2021-22 - getting to the pay window in a hurry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick summary of the showdown as Eastern battled Lewis Mills in a CCC South confrontation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BRISTOL EASTERN 11, LEWIS MILLS 6</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening a scholastic season over programs who have been playing lacrosse for a lot longer is always a challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s what the squad from Bristol Eastern bumps up against on almost a nightly basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the Lancers struck pay dirt to open the campaign, spinning rival Lewis Mills by an 11-5 final in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first of five straight home matches for the Lancers to open the year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern nabbed an early 1-0 edge, saw it tied for a bit but then ran off several goals to tally a cushion that was never challenged in the later stages of the contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This new and inexperienced team has pulled together in the preseason to form a combative force,” said Eastern coach Kayla Policarpio of her squad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emma Stavens led the offensive charge with a half-dozen goals and two assists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Teammate Vanessa Drury chipped in three goals and two assists while a couple newcomers to the program, Leah Roy and Sarah Hartley, each tallied a goal to complete the scoring effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mackenzie Aparo added an assist along the way while keeper Avery Ellis was solid in goal, notching 18 saves on the way to the victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pesky Spartans never went away and even after Drury found Stavens for the first goal of the showdown, Mills was on the attack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stavens later tallied a goal to make it a 3-1 contest and off a late Hartley goal with a second remaining in the first half, the Lancers scooped up a 6-4 lead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the scoring in the second half, Drury sank in one final goal as Eastern wrapped up an impressive 11-5 outing to begin the spring scholastic campaign with zest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Upcoming Eastern Schedule</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those matches next week commence at 3:45 p.m. - all from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Monday, April 25, Eastern tangles with Bristol Central for the first of two city showdown events this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
