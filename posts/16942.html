<p>Early last week, an incident was reported to Bristol police, and they conducted a full investigation. No charges were filed, but a warning was issued and there have been no further problems.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, September 6, Bristol police officers responded to the area of Judson Ave. where an adult<br>male was asking students at a bus stop if they would like a ride to school. The adult male was<br>allegedly recording the interaction with his cell phone.</p>

<p><br>The same male then went to Bristol Central High School where he spoke to the School Resource<br>Officer. The male explained that he would like to start a company to give rides to school students and was curious as to how to go about that.<br></p>

<p>After he left the school, the male was stopped by additional Bristol officers, who were still<br>investigating the original complaint. The male showed his cell phone video, which only showed<br>his own face, and he never attempted to coerce anyone into his vehicle. He asked the students<br>if they were interested in his business plan of an alternative form of transportation to school.<br></p>

<p>The local male was identified and was told that his actions were concerning to the students,<br>faculty, and law enforcement. He was told not to approach students in the future and find<br>other appropriate channels to follow up with his business plan.<br></p>
