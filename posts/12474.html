<p>FARMINGTON - For the first time this season, the Bristol Central baseball team jumped all over an opponent from the onset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That meant Farmington was in for a long afternoon on Thursday as the Rams scored four runs over the first two innings - earning a 4-3 victory from Tunxis Mead Park in Farmington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that big win was the 200th career victory for Bristol Central coach Bunty Ray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams (1-3) won for the first time this season while the River Hawks fell to 2-3 overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big bounce-back for Central, dropping a tough 7-4 decision to Avon the previous day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams racked up three runs in the top of the first and added another in the second, snaring a 4-0 push through just an inning-and-a-half of action.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was all the offense Central pitcher Nate Pirog needed, earning the win over four innings of work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He posted five strikeouts and allowed two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frank Spirito then came in to mop up - yielding just a single run and mowed down five batters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his efforts, Spirito earned a save over his three-inning stint on the hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington’s Brendan Kelly drew the loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central out-hit Farmington 9-6 with Ryan Ring, Christian Stafford, and Aiden Lopez leading the offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ring went 2-for-5 with two doubles, two RBI and a run scored, Lopez slipped out a two-base hit while Stafford was 2-of-3 with a triple, base-on-balls, and a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the showdown, Lopez led off with a double and Ring followed suit to score a run to make it a 1-0 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spirito then singled to get on and the Rams quickly notched another run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From first, Spirito was thrown out attempting to swipe second but on the play, Ring scored from third and a 2-0 lead ensued for Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford followed with his three-base tally and Zach Vanasse walked to put men on the corners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central tried the same trick again, having Vanasse steal second, and on the throw, Stafford scored as the Rams were in charge at 3-0 after a half-inning of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington went scoreless in the bottom of the tilt and when Central’s Mike Allen had a leadoff single in the second stanza, the visiting aggression was setting the table nicely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lopez walked to put two on and Allan scored when Ring unleashed another RBI double as Central led 4-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The River Hawks scored solitary runs in the second, third, and sixth innings but Farmington could never get over the hump as Central earned a badly needed win at 4-3.</p>
