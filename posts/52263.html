<p>The annual ski swap at Bob’s Sport Chalet which runs through Monday, Oct. 14., provides skiers an opportunity to grab a few bargains as they gear up for the new ski season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kids go through ski stuff so quickly that it's better to come and get used rather than getting something that's completely brand new,” said Kelly Kochan of Southington who was shopping for gloves and goggles with her two children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kochan was among the shoppers on a busy Sunday, day two of the three-day swap over the Columbus Day weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michael Santana, a Bristol resident, is a regular Bob’s customer, who likes the idea of recirculating old equipment and shopping local.</p>

<p>“I come to the swap to buy ski equipment, if I have old equipment that no longer serves a purpose for me, to sell it, [and] use that money to buy new equipment and spend more money skiing,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He finds specialty items not found in everyday stores at Bob's where he is a regular customer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And it's local business and, you know, you've got to support local businesses," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two more Southington shoppers, daughter Gabriella and dad Scott Mondo, who ski in Vermont, Sundown and Mt. Southington, were looking for deals on just about everything and anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve been using an old helmet forever," Scott said, conceding that his skis were pretty old, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gabriella said theirs is a ski family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been through our fair share of hand-me-downs,” she said, adding that they were looking for a helmet for her mom, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Ski Swap is the largest event of the year for Bob’s. It includes used equipment, such as skis, snowboards, boots and clothing, said co-owner Belinda Gonsalves who along with Bill run two stores–one in Bristol and another in Avon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We used to participate in ski swaps,” she said, “and decided to just do our own. We have been doing it for years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the items for sale is unused clothing at what amounts to a 50 percent discount.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob’s Sport Chalet’s annual Ski Sway is a three-day event on the same weekend every year, she said.</p>
