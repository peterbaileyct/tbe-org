<p>Prior to Saturday's BRXSTOL event, the originator of the project suggests that audience members take a second look at the trailers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Look for items, themes, symbols or colors that appear more than once," said C.T. O'Brien. "'Duality' is a central them to BRXSTOL.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRXSTOL is the immersive adventure steeped in Bristol history that has been developing over the past few months. It involves historical figures and asks participants to solve a mystery. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This Saturday, March 30, O'Brien will make a second presentation, this time at the Bristol Public Library, from 1 to 3 p.m., where he will advance the story line and provide new information about solving the secret.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"This is not just a presentation--it will be interactive," O'Brien said. "There will be props and folks will be on their feet for a small portion of the activity, if they want to participate or they can just observe."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said no prior knowledge of the project is necessary, and Saturday's program is open to the public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Listening to all or part of  the BRXSTOL podcast's first episode, "The Offer," is recommended," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the background information about the immersive, interactive adventure, called "BRXSTOL," is available on the website, including the trailers and the podcast segments. Click <a href="https://www.brxstol.com/">here.</a> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I will video record the event, but not participants, only myself and close-up shots, for upload to the BRXSTOL website at a future date," he said. "Use of AI will be interspersed throughout all elements of the event."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday's event will begin with an introduction, for new audience members, with a quick summary of the project, viewing of the trailers and a review of milestones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A presentation will follow with a recap of Chapters 1 and 2 of the podcast, "The Offer," and a live storytelling of Chapter 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A session of interactive problem solving that reveals the first clue to finding the "Secret Clock," a Q &amp; A session to answer any questions about next steps and a preview, "Where is the Clock?" video teaser will wrap things up.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
