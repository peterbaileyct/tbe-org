<p>MIDDLETOWN - Is there any slowing down the boys track and field team from Bristol Central this year?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might not be possible as the Rams have been nearly perfect over its first three meets, nabbing several first place tallies along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central traveled to Middletown on Tuesday afternoon and two teams have been ultra-competitive against each other in recent meets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this time around, Central won big – seizing a tremendous 110-39 CCC South victory in Middletown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams moved to 3-0 overall, nearly winning every event along the way on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bristol Central boys track and field gets a huge win over rival Middletown,” said coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk on Twitter. “[It was] total team effort winning every event. So proud of this team. Keep grinding.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central relay teams went out and dominated all three events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x800 relay, the Rams won in 9:16 as the team of Chris Roy, Patrick Wininger, Julieen Lopez, and Frankie Porrini earned the win.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 4x400, Porrini, Can Tomak, Wininger, and Rowan Hennessy took first place in 3:51 and then in the 4x100, the combination of Cassias Breland, Noah Conrod, Logan Jackson, and speedster Victor Rosa finished in 45.6 seconds – taking the heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosa also dominated the 100 meters (10.9 seconds) and 200 meters (22.7 seconds) races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noah Conrod took the 400 meters in 53.5 seconds and Roy won the 3200 in a stellar 11:14.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini won both the 800 meters (2:08) and 1600 meters (4:51) while Jackson nabbed victories in both hurdle events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson won the 110 hurdles in 19.6 seconds while finishing the 300 in 46.6 seconds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Treshawn Blair dominated all the jumping events that afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He squared up a win in the high jump with a leap of five feet, four inches and then in the long jump, Blair took the event (18-6.25).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally in the triple jump, Blair won on a successful make of 36 feet, three inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central’s Malachi Jones won the shot put with a toss of 47 feet, 5.5 inches, Dan Lauretti threw the discus a distance of 130 feet, 11 inches for first place and Rosa won a fourth event, chucking the javelin in 133 feet, seven inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Central track and field team has been tremendous to start the season, dominating all the competition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To open the campaign against Berlin, Central roped up a 113-37 victory and then a week later against Platt, it was a 110-40 win by the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program is averaging 111 points-per-meet which is an impressive scoring tally.</p>
