<p>Hello Trainers!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Happy Memorial Day! I know that this special holiday will be next Monday, but I wanted to take a moment now to thank all the men and women that made it and make it possible for us to live in this country with our freedoms today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, Naganadel finally comes to Pokemon GO! Just a reminder with this event, Trainers will be able to evolve Poipole into Naganadel by using 200 Poipole Candy after catching 20 Dragon-type Pokémon with Poipole as their Buddy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lucky for us, there are many raids that are happening that are dragon-themed, and they will be popping up all over Bristol! These raids also have shiny encounter too, so when you can, raid them with your fellow Trainers and get those dragons! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These raids also start today, so check the local spots listed in this article to get a head start on those field test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mega Pidgeot will be from May 23 to June 1, Blacephalon joins the raids later today, and several other smaller Pokémon will be spawning today as well! These five-star raid Pokémon are weak to rock Pokémon, so if you caught a Regirock from the last raid with any rock moves can make quick work in these raids. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure you guys don’t miss your chance to catch Shadow Suicune as May only has eight days left. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Per usual, check out these spots:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Federal Hill Green, 33 Queen St.<br>Page Park, 651 King St.<br>Rockwell Park, 238 Jacobs St.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, Trainers can look forward to a Ferroseed-themed Incense Day event on Sunday, May 26. During the event, fans will have an increased chance to encounter Ferroseed and its Shiny form through incense. Additionally, certain Grass and Steel-type Pokemon will be attracted to Incense throughout the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are missions that require certain Pokémon to be caught, and this will be the best chance to get them for these field research. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t know already, to earn a Research Breakthrough, you’ll need to complete seven Field Research tasks during May. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you complete one every day, you could earn up to four encounters during the month. These can also drop shiny Pokémon as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be sure to gear up for next week as we ready ourselves for the start of June for a special event! For more information, visit <a href="http://www.pokemongolive.com">www.pokemongolive.com</a>. </p>

<p>Until next time Trainers!</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions.
