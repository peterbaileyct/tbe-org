<h4>150 Years Ago – May 1872</h4>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A destructive fire occurred last Thursday caused by sparks from the locomotive setting fire to dry leaves near Cuss Gutter. The flames spread southward and westward, setting fire to the house, barn and sawmill of Hiram Norton, but the building was saved by the activity of the fire department. The fire continued up the hill towards Fall Mountain and Messrs. J.R. Gridley and J.G Peck are the chief losers in fences and timber.</p>

<p>Four hundred dollars has been pledged to complete the sidewalk from Mr. Funck’s corner to High Street. As soon as this is done residents of High Street have agreed to lay a good sidewalk on both sides of the street as far as it is built up.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now the question is will this work be delayed another year subjecting our citizens to such inconveniences as were experienced this spring or shall the much needed improvement be done without further delay? A clergyman last Sunday in the pulpit praised the public spirit of the citizens of Bristol. Remaining to be seen is whether he was speaking plainly or ironically. Public spirit, of the right sort, puts sidewalks into good shape, always and everywhere.</p>
