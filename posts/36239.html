<p>Bristol Public Schools have been experiencing continual bus delays since the start of the academic school year, and Wednesday's bus experience left some students on buses hours longer than usual with parents and grandparents wondering where their charges were.</p>

<p>“We recognize that there are continual busing issues with First Student Transportation.&nbsp;We hear you and acknowledge that this has been a frustration and inconvenience for some of our families this school year,” said Superintendent Dr. Catherine Carbone in a communication to BPS families Wednesday.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We fully expect First Student to resolve these issues and fulfill their contractual obligations,” Carbone said.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Public Schools staff members have messaged families as soon as they are informed that a bus is running late. However, BPS stated that there have been instances of buses running late and they have not been informed by First Student. As a result, BPS stated that they have been unable to message families in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>First Student, the company&nbsp;that provides the transportation for Bristol Public Schools, currently does not have enough bus drivers to cover the school district’s needs. The shortage has resulted in bus departure and arrival delays.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
