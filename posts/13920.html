<p>NEW BRITAIN - The 2022 CIAC State Open in boys track and field from Willow Brook Park in New Britain on Monday was another showcase event for the program from Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams ended up placing 21st overall with 10 points and held their own against some of the biggest programs across the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hillhouse won the Open title behind 64 points while Hall (57) was the runner up, seven points behind the winning mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simsbury (third place, 45 points), Naugatuck (fourth, 40) and Stonington (fifth, 27) rounded out the top five squads from the meet in New Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Central had plenty of New England Qualifiers and top 10 finishers on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankie Porrini, the talented junior distance runner, was simply amazing in the 1600 meters for the Rams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He placed seventh overall with a time of 4:17.67 – running extremely well at the Open challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Porrini was the first junior ever from Central to finish the 1600 meters in under 4:20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Porrini ended the race in an amazing time of 4:17.64 – an incredible finish for the outstanding athlete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of that outstanding time, he’ll be heading for the New England Championship to compete in that event over a very crowded field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the javelin, Central senior Victor Rosa made a huge toss of 165 feet to seize fourth place – showing a little flash on his way to UCONN to play football.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Vic Rosa finishes of his track and field career at Bristol Central with a fourth-place finish in the javelin,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk via Twitter. “It’s been quite a ride these two years! Bristol Central Track and Field wishes Vic the best on his next big adventure playing football for UCONN!.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then in the triple jump, Tre Blair’s leap of 43 feet, four feet was good for a tremendous sixth place showing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for the Rams, the 4x100 meter relay team took 17th place as the combination of Cassias Breland, Noah Conrod, Jarrett Boxley, and Rosa crossed the finish line in 45.04 seconds. Malachi Jones earned 14th place in the shot put (44 feet, 9.50 inches), and Dan Lauretti’s toss of 128 feet, nine inches was good for 15th place in the discus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The 4x100 meter relay team of Cassias Breland, Noah Conrod, Jarrett Boxley, and Victor Rosa finished off a strong season as did senior throwers Dan Lauretti (discus) and Malachi Jones (shot put),” said Stafford-Kirk. “Fellow seniors Noah Conrod and Jarret Boxley finished off awesome careers for Bristol Central track and field and [will] compete together for Southern Connecticut State University next year!”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other top finishers for Central include Conrod in the 400 meters (19th, 51.88 seconds), Porrini took 20th in the 800 (2:01.52) while Blair nabbed 12th in the high jump (five feet, 10 inches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Porrini and Blair, those two juniors will lead a strong group of returners next season at Central and will be the backbone of the Rams’ boys track and field program in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All athletes who placed in the top six at the Open qualified to compete in the New England Championships from Willow Brook Park this Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means a couple Central athletes will be back in action this coming weekend to compete against the best around New England.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We look forward to them competing at New England’s this weekend,” said Stafford-Kirk of her team’s qualifiers. “Frankie [Porrini] will also run the steeplechase at Nike Outdoor Nationals at historic Hayward Field at University of Oregon on June 18th.”</p>
