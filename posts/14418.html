<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Senior American Legion baseball squad is suddenly on a hot streak – winning four straight games as the month of June is about to be put in the books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 opened the year at 1-3 overall but have started to shine offensively while getting significant contributions from the top of the batting order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since dropping a tough 5-3 decision to Meriden back on June 16, Bristol has been perfect, notching 30 runs over that four-game winning streak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the game becomes a lot easier when Post 2 can manufacture runs without hitting the ball all over the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Bristol’s 6-2 triumph over Torrington in the first game of a doubleheader last Sunday, Bristol never hit the ball out of the infield to manufacture the first run of the fourth inning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dillon Hudson and Tyler Martin were both hit-by-pitch while Matt Beaucar sacrificed the duo over via bunt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when Chris Osuch was also plunked by a ball, the bases were loaded up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Elliot Norris laid down a perfect bunt to score Hudson and Bristol had its fourth run on the board. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There was a guy on second with no outs, get him over [to third], get him in, we scored a run without even getting a hit,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta. “That’s stuff we practice all the time in batting practice.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of Norris, the shortstop – along with leftfielder/pitcher Jayden Churchill – have been tremendous at the top of the Post 2 batting order.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both batters have been lethal in the line-up, helping set the table and even bought home runners with ducks on the pond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Elliot and Jayden, one-two at the top [of the batting order], have just been playing phenomenal,” said LaPenta of Norris and Churchill. “Elliot’s been playing great at shortstop.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill won a game on the hill against Torrington on Sunday and over Post 2’s 4-0 streak, he’s been tremendous at the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s batted 6-of-12 during that undefeated stretch which included a slick 3-for-3 in the 6-5 victory against Post 38 to finish up play on Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill etched up two singles and a double while walking in the first inning – eventually scoring a run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has excellent speed and is a thief on the basepaths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since Norris has been installed at the top of the batting order, the speedster has made getting on base a real habit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over his last five games, Norris has gone 9-of-18 from the dish and is clearly the best bunter on the team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he puts the ball in play, it’s off to the races – a challenge the defense does not enjoy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That pressure also causes opposing defenses to make miscues and errors in the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s just a pest when he’s up” at the plate said LaPenta of Norris. "Even when he hits it, it likes if he doesn’t hit it right to somebody, he runs balls out.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris turned it on since Bristol’s two-run setback against Meriden on June 16 – never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He went 2-of-3 from the plate, scored two runs, stole a couple bases and notched two RBI in Bristol’s tough loss to Meriden and hasn’t relented since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Norris/Churchill combo will give opponents fits for the rest of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A typical Bristol line-up sees third baseman Adam Caron bat third while the vacuum cleaner in centerfield – Ryan Fradette – also brings speed to the plate and can smash the ball all over Muzzy Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tyler Stickels, Hudson, Martin, Beaucar and Osuch have been showing chemistry in the batting order and on the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is continuing to build by the game, hoping to eventually catch streaking West Hartford – currently sitting at 9-0 on top of the Zone 1 standings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like the character of the team,” said LaPenta. “They play hard together. They do the right things.”</p>
