<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central girls basketball team wasted little time in its opening round game of the BC Holiday Classic against Wolcott Tech on Tuesday evening – notching the first 27 points of the game – as the Rams rolled to an easy 70-7 win from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central (3-2) earned a shot at the Holiday Classic championship in a rematch against Gilbert (1-1) from last season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The locals turned defense into offense and off the power of 21 steals, high percentage buckets were tallied by just about everyone in a maroon and white uniform.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we get out in transition and turn the ball over, we’re putting some points on the board,” said Central coach Steve Gaudet. “Playing good defense, transition [points] are always key for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, Central shot 31-of-58 from the field (53.4-percent) over what turned into a whirlwind thirty-two minutes of play in one of the program’s most lopsided victories ever.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And within the first ninety seconds of the contest, the Wildcats trailed 10-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Callie Lodovico (seven points, four assists) started the game with a lay-up and then Ariana Rivera (game-highs of 15 points and six steals) made a steal and a bucket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brooke Watson (four points, three steals) slipped a nice dish over to Leilani Jackson (13 points, four steals) for a lay-up, and the duo made the same connect via a steal and hoop and when Rivera made a theft of her own – cashing in on another high-percentage shot – the Rams had ten quick points in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later in the frame, an offensive rebound by Kaley Laird (four points, five assists) led to a jumper for Jackson and then Rivera closed out the frame by scoring seven of the final nine points – her last field goal leading to and-1 – as the Rams gobbled up a 27-0 push after eight minutes of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our leaders, Watson, Rivera and Lodovico, have been outstanding,” said Gaudet. “Leilani has been outstanding.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wolcott’s Rosalena Carlson (five points) got her squad on the board with 7:48 left in the second stanza via a 3 and when she canned a jumper about eighty seconds later, the Wildcats trimmed the deficit to 33-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then 17 consecutive points by Central, including a couple hoops from Nicole Riemer (13 points, eight rebounds) –&nbsp;notching six points overall in the period – gave the Rams an imposing 50-5 halftime push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nicole Riemer, as a freshman, she plays much older than her age,” said Gaudet. “It’s nice to see.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central came into the third period with the same zest but the home team did not upstage the overwhelmed visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone touched the ball, the team was patient and attacked the hoop only when necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jackson canned a shot, Rivera dropped in another lay-up and with the reserves hitting the court for the remainder of the game early in the tilt, it was more of the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivia Morton (two points, four rebounds) found Sierra Messier for a hoop and then Morton finished the third with a lay-up of her own as Central held a commanding 58-5 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The young kids have been improving every day,” said Gaudet. “They are coming to practice and working as hard as anyone. We have some talented young kids who are going to be talented players. They are kind of being forced into action because of our [lack of] depth but it’s good for them, it’s good for us and for the future of the program.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth frame,&nbsp;Lodovico hit two charity tosses, Molly McMahon (eight points, two steals) connected on six straight points and when Riemer flashed in two final lay-ups, Central cruised to a 63-point victory and a date against Gilbert in the tournament finals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The championship tilt commences at 6 p.m. on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’ve been on the opposite side of the scoreboard quite a few times,” said Gaudet of the final score. “I know how it feels being on the other side. You want to show some sportsmanship, you want to show some dignity and you want to respect the team and the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the Rams did all of those things that day. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>The win gave Central head coach Steve Gaudet his 100<sup>th</sup> career victory. &nbsp;</p>
