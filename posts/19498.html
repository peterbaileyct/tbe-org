<p>Come Sunday morning, the clocks will have been set back an hour, back to Eastern Standard Time, not Daylight Savings Time, and I will be fine with that. I like EST and I am all for sticking to it for the entire year. The “powers that be” have decided, however, that after one more turn of the clock this spring Connecticut will settle on DST all year around—no more switching back and forth. It’s not my choice, but it’s a compromise that I can live with, since it eliminates having to change the clocks two times a year.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, there is the week ahead that looms large. This current&nbsp;election campaign season just might be the new normal, with its rabid advertising, incessant emails and texting, exorbitant financing and excessive polling which encourages horse race coverage rather than a thorough vetting of issues. How often I hanker for, long for, news that does a deep dive into the issues—something I hope TBE will be able to contribute once we are fully operational. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, I think about the demands made on each and every one of us by these campaigns. It takes special people to be able to function in an&nbsp;environment like this one—an environment that under the guise of informing citizens confuses, irritates and incites them. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are reasons for obfuscating rather than illuminating, but that is a discussion for another day. For the time being, we need to be able to maintain a sense of calm, set aside hysteria and focus on the essentials. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not at all an easy task, especially when all the madness is supposed to result in a sensible action—voting. And then, after the vote, counting the votes—something that might take more time than we are used to--, acknowledging the winners and moving ahead with the business of the people. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curiously enough, the statewide ballot initiative that, if passed, would allow early voting, will be an interesting development simply for the way it might change how campaigning works. If a great deal of voters get out there and vote before election day, might it mean that it will mean news operations will have to focus on issue throughout the year rather than simply zeroing in on who is ahead at the end?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There, another discussion for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, if you haven’t already, please vote, and if possible, take someone who might be reluctant, or who might feel that voting is futile, or who might say voting doesn’t matter, or who needs a ride but is too proud to mention it, take that person with you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listening/reading this week includes an intriguing podcast that attempts to solve a major problem associated with elections—how to moderate ads on social media, specifically, how to decide what ads should or should not run based on truthfulness.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The podcast suggests, and tests, the hypothesis that teenagers are the answer. Check out the most recent episodes from the podcast, "The Last Archive": “Trial by Teenager, Part 1” and “Trial by Teenager, Part 2.” Click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thelastarchive.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Scroll down the page for the podcasts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The Last Archive" podcast describes itself as "a show about the history of truth, and the historical context for our current fake news, post-truth moment.” The “Trial by Teenager” episodes ask the question, “What if there&nbsp;were a way to stop politicians from lying on social media?”&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“Come Sunday morning” is intended to be a weekly review, a recounting of the past week and an anticipation of week to come. Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism.

<p>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email </em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em> <em>People with financial difficulties may write </em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em> to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
