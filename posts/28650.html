<p>TOLLAND - With one game and a makeup on deck for the Bristol American Legion Baseball team on Friday, Post 2 went back to old hand Jayden Churchill against the squad from Northeast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a tremendous showing against Ridgefield the previous Sunday, Churchill was eager to send the Northeast squad packing from Cross B in Tolland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the home team notched five first inning runs, hitting the ball here, there and everywhere, as Post 2 fell by a 7-2 final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast improved to 9-10-1 overall while Bristol dropped to 10-8-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We tried to get lightning twice in a bottle,” said Bristol coach Jerry LaPenta of turning to Churchill. “We just couldn’t really do it. But I thought Jayden pitched okay.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was just a tough five-run first inning that doomed the outstanding athlete in the end as Post 2 was playing catch-up until the very last out was recorded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Removing the nasty five run first inning, Churchill was serviceable, getting out of every jam he faced.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He got attacked in the bottom of the first as Northeast sent nine batters to the plate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An error at third base allowed Andrew McGann to score the first run of the game and an RBI single to left by Diego Mercado made it a 2-0 contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Mason Wilson blasted a two-run double to left and when Tyler Barrette ended the scoring with a single to center, Wilson came home to make it a 5-0 contest through one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The first inning, there was a little comebacker to start the game,” said LaPenta. “And if Caleb [Molinsky] makes that catch [in centerfield], that would have been huge.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill battled over the next four innings as Northeast was held off the scoreboard.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol started to chip away at it in the top of the second as Cole Caccamo slapped an infield hit up the middle that bounced off the mound and died - moving over the second base via a balk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Caccamo scored off an infield error as Post 2 chopped the deficit to 5-1.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast’s Jared Wilhelm zipped up a walk to start the bottom of the second that went nowhere while Post 2 went 1-2-3 in the top of the third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill settled down nicely, retiring seven of his last eight batters as Bristol entered the fourth frame still down by four runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast loaded the bases in its portion of the fourth, but Churchill induced a pop-out to Norris at shortstop as Bristol kept it a 5-1 deficit going into the top of the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 had something brewing as Molinsky and Josh Dunne cashed out back-to-back infield hits and the duo was on second and third with two away in the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Nick Sconziano struck out as Northeast continued to lead by four (5-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast attacked in the bottom of the fifth as Mercado led off with single to left before Sanchez robbed Attley Stevens of a hit at third base with a great stop and throw over to first for an out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with two away, Barrette walked to put runners on the corners but Churchill fanned Colin Gudeman to end the fifth to keep the thing a 5-1 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jayden settled in,” said LaPenta of Churchill after the first inning. “He threw pretty well.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post 2 went three up and three down in the top of the sixth as Bristol’s Josh Dunne came into pitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northeast notched two runs as an RBI single by Joey Keane and a run scoring single from Ryan Duffy made it a 7-1 game heading into the seventh and final stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol tried to rally in the top of the seventh as Conor Cyr reached base via fielder’s choice, advanced to second on a passed ball and went to third on a Molinsky groundout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infield hit by Josh Dunne scored Cyr to chop the deficit to 7-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Dunne added an infield hit of his own but off one final grounder by Sconziano ended the contest as Northeast nabbed a big 7-2 win.</p>
