<p>Due to the continued spike in COVID cases across the state, Bristol Health is taking precautionary measures to keep its patients and staff safe by implementing its no visitation policy, which will go into effect on Friday, Dec. 31st. <br><br>"Due to the increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases in our communities, we are revising our visitation policy," said Donna Morris, Bristol Health's Manager of Infection Prevention and Regulatory Programs. "In an abundance of caution to keep our patients, staff and community members safe, we are limiting visitation and access to the hospital to those considered essential to operations and those requiring hospital services and care."</p>
