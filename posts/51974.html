<p>Eastern held most of the possession in the first half. However, they couldn't find the goal again. Their shots went wide or were saved by Marble.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's frustrating to get so much possession and not be able to finish, " said Eastern coach Bill Sweet. "Credit goes to the Thomaston defenders who did just enough to deny us another goal."</p>

<p>Early in the second half, a Lancer back misplayed a ball. Thomaston's Tiago Silva took it in on goal and scored. He hit a hard ground shot past Eastern's goalie Connor Murtaugh at 36:37.&nbsp; </p>
