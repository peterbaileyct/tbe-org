<p>Hello Bristol, and welcome to Monday. Next week is finally here.</p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, 53 and partly sunny or partly cloudy, depending on your slant.</p>

<h3>Speaking of Mondays</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday is largely believed to be the worst day of the week. However, there is hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday is the best day to buy a new car. Because weekends are the busiest for car dealers, studies show the best day to buy a vehicle is Monday due to car buyers receiving more time and attention from a salesperson.</p>

<h3>Traffic cones</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are an estimated 140 million traffic cones in use around the globe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly enough, approximately 1 million traffic cones are stolen each year in the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To help avoid such issues in the United Kingdom, cone amnesties are occasionally provided by local police departments.</p>

<p>Sadly, The Port-O-Let Watch Team advised the GMB via the TBE that the Port-O-Let at Seymour Park on Shrub Road was removed.</p>

<h3>Way back when</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prior to <em>The Bristol Edition,</em> there were other newspapers in town. Among them <em>The Bristol Times</em> (1831), <em>The Bristol Lash</em>, <em>The Bristol Bull-Let-In</em> (1844), <em>Monthly Review</em> (1844), and <em>The Old Guard</em> (1845).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Historical and Scientific Society, in an article for <em>The Connecticut Quarterly</em> in June of 1898, described them as scurrilous and “occasionally printed and quietly scattered in the community.”</p>

<h3>Say goodnight, Gracie</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This GMB is no more. Good luck out there, Bristol.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free acces</em>s.</p>
