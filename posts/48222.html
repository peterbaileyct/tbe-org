<p>Bristol’s American Legion team stood one game behind Simsbury in the Zone 1 standings heading into their game Monday, night. A loss would put them two games behind in the race for second place, and a win would put them in a tie.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The time was right for an offensive explosion, and that is just what the Bristol batters delivered, scoring eleven runs on twelve hits. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to add the icing on the cake, Ryan Maglio and Jonny Montgomery combined to throw a no-hitter in shutting out the Simsbury nine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four Bristol batters, Brian Grabowski, Connor Cyr, Rocco Spirito, and Jose Feliciano, collected two hits on the night. Spirito had three RBI’s, and Maglio and Brayden Schenck added two apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol also ran at will on the bases. Cyr and Thomas Pirog had two stolen bases each, and Schenck and Grabowski each had one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol improves to 10-6 on the season, 3 1/2 games behind first place West Hartford with a 12-1 record.</p>

<p>Bristol gets back at it with Simsbury tonight at Muzzy Field in a 5:30 face-off.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
