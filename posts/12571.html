<p>A Bristol native, Rasmussen-Tuller has served on the City of Bristol Economic and Community Development Board since 2019. He owns a local Real Estate brokerage, and his background includes retail and manufacturing management. In his time on the ECDB, Rasmussen-Tuller has focused on the bi-partisan plans to develop Bristol’s Centre Square.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rasmussen-Tuller stated, “I have seen a startling lack of representation in the 77<sup>th</sup> district and want to change that. I want to work for the people of our district by changing how things are done in Hartford and bringing more of our tax dollars back home to Bristol.”</p>
