<p>When Bristol’s American Legion baseball team lost to Naugatuck on June 26, they stood at a record of 5-6 and were in fourth place in Zone 1. It looked like it might be a season of offensive struggles and a difficult task of keeping their heads above water.</p>

<p>But that loss to Naugatuck was the last defeat Bristol would suffer. On Sunday, Bristol ran off their tenth win in a row, a 5-3 decision over Ridgefield at Page Park, and they carry a tremendous amount of momentum into the State Tournament.</p>

<p>Declan Schenck was the pitching star on Sunday, coming on to begin the fourth inning and allowing only one hit over his four innings of work, getting the win over Ridgefield.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The offense on Sunday featured a balanced attack, as the eight hits Bristol garnered were shared by eight members of the lineup. </p>

<p>Jedric Sutula had a double and two RBI’s to pace Bristol, and Thomas Pirog and Jose Feliciano also doubled in the game.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The team finishes the regular season with a record of 15-6, in second place behind defending state champion West Hartford.</p>

<p>Bristol will open play in the 2024 State Tournament on Tuesday, hosting Ridgefield again at Muzzy Field at 5:30. Ridgefield won a play-in game over Moosup to gain entry to the Tournament.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
