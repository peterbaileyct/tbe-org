<p>NEW HAVEN - The Bristol Eastern football team shattered a record - and possibly established another - after the squad zipped up a nail-biting 2-0 victory over Hillhouse on Friday night in New Haven during a Connecticut Football Alliance showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple snap by Hillhouse at their own two-yard line was finished off with a disastrous result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball was snapped into orbit and when it sailed out of bounds, and through the end zone, a safety was awarded to the visiting team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were awarded two points and a free kick with 7:24 left in the first period which was all the points that were needed to topple the Academics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next drive went nowhere for Eastern and, credit to the Kingstreeters excellent defense, the squad did not allow any follow up scores.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Eastern program, it was the fewest points ever scored in a Lancers’ victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, it was only the second game in Eastern history that the team ended the contest by scoring just two points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first time that happened came back on October 17, 1997.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That night, Eastern challenged Southington in a CCC South entanglement from Muzzy Field back when the Knights and Lancers were regular opponents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern fell by a 19-2 final to Southington and then head coach Jude Kelly - the former St. Paul Catholic mentor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in that game, the Lancers ended up scoring first just like the squad did in New Haven on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With 11:05 left in the first half against Southington, the Knights snapped the ball out of bounds and Eastern was awarded two points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Southington then scored 19 straight points to ice the game, leading to the 17-point loss for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was one of the few games Bristol’s all-time leading rusher Reinaldo Soto did not score a touchdown in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He made 28 carries for 103 yards while Billy Woods, Jayson Thompson, Darin Pelletier, and Rob Moreau all had a hand in the offensive schemes in the bout against Southington.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fast Forward to Friday, September 22, 2023, Eastern scored the first two points and did not notch a follow-up score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers’ defense - led by Adam and Ryan Zavecz, Hunter Wells, Mikey Sherrill and Jaiden Fore - held off every Hillhouse drive as the program is 3-0 for the first time since 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Was the 2-0 win by the Lancers football team a state record?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did this two-point effort by Eastern tie a state record for fewest points scored by the winning team?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would make sense if it did because a team can’t just score a single point - except after touchdowns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A minimum victory would be 2-0, the only score possible, and it looks like the Eastern program put itself in the state - and national - records book.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a pretty cool deal as the undefeated season moves on for the Lancers with another home game from Alumni Field on the horizon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More on that contest on Friday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Talking Playoffs?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not to jinx this season, but at 3-0, the Lancers are currently in line for a state tournament berth for the first time since 2010.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern is in fifth place of the Class MM standings with 355 power points in Connecticut’s convoluted playoffs points format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That would put the Kingstreeters on the road against Guilford (3-0) if things held pat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that’s a looooong way off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Defense is king</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lost in the Lancers’ 2-0 effort at Hillhouse is the fact the locals have shut down three opponents this season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opponents are averaging just 9.0 points-per-game against Eastern while the squad posts 21.3 ppg in offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s called a winning formula.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, the Lancers’ 2-0 victory at Hillhouse was Eastern’s first shutout since winning at Hartford Public by a 35-0 final back on October 5, 2019.</p>
