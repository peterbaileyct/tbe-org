<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol 17U American Legion Baseball program is the top squad in all Zone 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And on Saturday, Post 2 was able to completely shut down Torrington, wrangling up a 3-0 victory from Riley Field in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is now all alone in first place at 7-1, a complete game over Ellington and Torrington (5-1).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss for Post 38 was the first for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Gabe White started the contest for Bristol and threw extremely well over a no-decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He chucked 65 pitches over four innings, eventually making way for Jack Ericksen (two innings, 33 pitches).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ericksen was helped by a three run fifth despite Post 2 being held to just two hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Simard mopped up for the save over his one frame of action, leading to a huge win in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky (1-for-3) and Jonathan Montgomery (1-for-3) each tallied hits for the home program while Gavin Colvin, Brian Grabowski and Montgomery all scored runs as Bristol continued its first place push.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three errors by Post 38 did not help matters while the Torrington program allowed just two hits and played extremely well over every inning except the fifth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Scoring runs at a magnificent rate</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is a scoring juggernaut, posting 76 runs over eight games (9.5 runs-per-game) and there isn’t any Zone 3 team that’s close to that offensive capability.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waterford, somehow a member of Zone 3, is in second place with 50 runs over half-a-dozen games played going into Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, Post 2 gives up less than three runs a game (2.9 per game).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a winning formula at any level of baseball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upcoming slate</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol gets a bit of a break this week as the squad is in action just once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, Post 2 travels to Middletown at 7 p.m. from Pat Kidney Field in another big Zone 3 showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 7 p.m.</p>
