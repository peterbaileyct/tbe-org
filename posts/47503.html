<p>City Arts and Culture commissioner Nigel Wynter is passionate about his artwork and just as serious about encouraging others to try some form of art for themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whenever I go to events like these [Juneteenth Freedom Day]," he said, "I meet people who like to draw. I also find people who used to draw, and, for whatever reason, life got in the way. So, the passion they had for art has faded away.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wynter was one of the vendors at the Juneteenth celebration this past Wednesday at the Carousel Museum. He was also one of the event sponsors. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I mostly draw things people wouldn’t find beauty in,” he said. “Rustic tools [and] things of that nature. Everyday things.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wynter said he likes when people see his art because there is a story behind each piece. It is why he goes out to events. He gets to interact with people and to see people interact with each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Art itself is solitary,” he said. “Art is for introverts and it’s hard to put yourself out there.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the beginning of his career, he said, he had a hard time getting out of his comfort zone.</p>

<p>He said that he has formal art training. His website lists his education and accomplishments, including studying Illustration at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the website mentions his awards and that he was a member of the Mt. Vernon Art Association, Mamaroneck Artists Guild, Stratford Artists' Guild, the 2013 Bridgeport Art Fest and Open Studio in Hartford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The older people get, Wynter said, the more he notices they become more self-conscious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that seeing art and the creative process from the perspective of a child helps people have more freedom in their expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Just be like a child," he advised. “Don’t ever be afraid to create."</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.                </li>
