<p>First time voter Ella McIntyre visited the Registrars of Voters Office in city hall on Saturday where she registered to vote and voted for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I know what I want to see in Connecticut and the country all around for the people, so with my voting I feel strongly for what I am voting for, but it's still like, being the first time, it's just scary," said Ella McIntyre, a 19-year-old college student who grew up in Bristol and attended Bristol schools.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McIntyre, who was with her mother, Jennifer, were driving by when her mother suggested they stop in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We missed being able to register online, and I'm like, they're open, let's go, and she's like, 'I'm so nervous,'" Jennifer said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ella said she was a little nervous about voting because she felt she did not have a real good background about voting, conceding that this is one area her education fell short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"We don't learn about any of this in school," she said. She attended Bristol Eastern High School and now attends Tunxis where she is pursuing a business degree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said she didn't remember covering past presidents or elections, in general.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Her mom asked to jump in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think there's more that can be done to help kids understand," Jennifer said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If I might, I just want to interject because I think that there is some education" about the topic in schools. "you know, they'll go through what Congress is and all that. But I just don't think, and I hate to say it, but I think schools, they don't focus on it."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I think it's important for them to learn and understand how important it is to vote and having that opportunity to vote is so important, it's so empowering," she said, "even though I know the country is in flux right now, I really do think it's important."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's why, as they were driving by, she suggested that they stop, she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Ella, despite her initial trepidation about registering for the first time, and voting for the first time, the experience was a good thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall, she said, "I feel pretty good about it. It's exciting."</p>
