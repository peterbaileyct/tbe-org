<p>BRISTOL – The Bristol Central football team is looking to end the season with a big splash at the annual showdown against Bristol Eastern from Muzzy Field.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The season has been a trying one for the Rams but anytime you can win on Thanksgiving, it’s a big lift for your program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Plus, the Rams have maintained possession of the bell since the 2015 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why give up it up now?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Tre Blair has the ability to run the ball here, there and everywhere against the Lancers but it's going to be an epic challenge and Central needs a complete game effort as the Lancers come into the contest with a little second-half of the season momentum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And no matter how this turkey is sliced, it’s going to be a good one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a look at Bristol Central on Thanksgiving (not knowing the full injury report and possible marking period implications):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Head Coach</strong>: Jeff Papazian (Eighth Thanksgiving Day game as Central’s head coach – winner of six straight clashes against BE).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date and Time of the event</strong>: The squads take the grass field from Muzzy Field at 10:30 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Time (2021)</strong>: Central roped up a huge 38-8 win off the amazing efforts by senior standout Victor Rosa. Rosa belted the Lancers for over 280 yards on the ground for the third highest Bristol Thanksgiving Day rushing total ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Series</strong>: The Rams lead the all-time series 37-23-2 and haven’t lost on Thanksgiving since 2014 (20-18).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central Series Fact</strong>: The 38 points was the most that Central has scored on Thanksgiving since the game in 2002 (38-0). And since Eastern won three straight games (1996-1998) off the power of then Bristol’s all-time leading rusher Reinaldo Soto, Central leads the series 13-8-1 over the past 22 encounters. The Rams have won every contest against Eastern since 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Current Record:&nbsp;</strong>Central comes into the Thanksgiving Day showdown with a ledger of 1-8, looking to break a seven-game losing streak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to watch</strong>: Tre Blair (sr. ATH), Nik Salinas (sr. QB/RB/DB), Johnny Rios (sr. RB/DL), Carmelo Thompson (so, RB/injured); Aiden Lamarre (jr, WR/LB), Julius Powell (sr, OL/LB/injured), Anthony Paulino (jr. WR/DB); Jack Jones (jr, OL/LB); Mason Stokes (sr. TE/DL), Can Tomak (sr, WR/DB), Giovannie Colon (sr, RB/LB), Tashawn Cauley (so, OL/DL), Oscar Kuzniar (jr, K), Jayden Colon (jr, OL/DL), Luis Padilla (jr, OL/DL), Jonmanuel Gomez (sr, OL/DL), Julieen Lopez (so, WR/DB), Ayden Pratt (jr, TE/LB), Caleb Simard (so, TE/LB).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why Bristol Central could win</strong>…The Rams have played an extremely tough schedule, no doubt about it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Central knows that Bristol’s ‘Super Bowl’ is nearly a once (maybe twice or three times if you’re good)-in-a-life showcase for the players and the Rams don’t want to spoil that holiday tradition.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, despite the sub-.500 record, anything can happen on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>”We flip the page,” said Papazian of the year with the Thanksgiving Day clash on deck. “It’s on to a one-game season.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central can win its second game of the year off the power of Mr. Everything, senior Tre Blair (team-leading 135 carries, 876 yards, four touchdowns).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like UConn standout Victor Rosa, Blair has unlimited ability with the ball and will take the first hit and simply keep running.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Rams go to its vaunted quarterback draw led offense, Blair can pop off for scores if he finds an open crease or seam in the Lancers’ defense to dash through.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he’s certainly in reach of a 1,000-yard campaign which would be a huge feather in his cap off such a tough season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior always gives it his all and is an extreme athlete. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blockers for Blair include Nik Salinas (62-237-3) and Johnny Rios (61-176) – two backs that will also run with the ball.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both seniors will factor in sometime during the game and if injured sophomore Carmelo Thompson (35-106) is in the mix, Eastern’s defense is going to have to stop Central’s ground game from the start.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Salinas (25 passes, 399 yards, three TDs) and Blair (7-for-16, 99 yards, two TDs) can throw the ball but it’s not a weapon that has been heavily utilized by the program.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blair (eight catches, 168 yards, two touchdowns) was the primary receiver earlier in the campaign but if Lamarre is out and about (eight catches, 80 yards), that’s a target Eastern must be wary of.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defensively, the Lancers must look out for Mason Stokes, Can Tomak, Giovannie Colon, Ayden Pratt, Julieen Lopez, Jack Jones, Luis Padilla and Tashawn Cauley among others along with Salinas.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Injuries have played a role in Central’s overall schemes and the loss of warriors such as senior Julius Powell has proven costly on both lines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he’s been extremely vocal from the sidelines, giving advice and cheering his team on. That’s exactly what you should expect from your senior leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though this team has been hit with the injury bug, Central won’t be making any excuses on Turkey Day because the Rams expect to defend the bell.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The X-Factor</strong>…Nik Salinas seems to fit that listing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salinas is a do-it-all player on the gridiron whether it’s running the ball, tossing it around or playing defense.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s not a big numbers guy on offense but on a third-and-short situation, Papazian can call Salinas’s number and he’ll produce.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the line of scrimmage, he’s tallied over 700 yards this year – scooping up a combined six touchdowns.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Salinas is going to be lurking offensively and if Blair is keyed upon, the senior standout will see the ball come his way a time or two on Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always the little details in a city series game that seems to lead to the biggest results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And don’t forget about kicker Oscar Kuzniar who can boot a ball or two through the uprights from distance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He could be the guy that kicks in the winning points(s) against the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central can’t…</strong>Allow Eastern to run wild on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s where Eastern junior back Jaiden Fort comes into play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Blair, he’ll run through anything – sometimes blazing his own path in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Central frontline will have to make that first tackle count and if Fort doesn’t have the ball, the program will turn to Ray Andrews or even sophomore stud Jack Hartley for gains.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s ground game can be lethal if it’s allowed to go unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forcing the Lancers into some long third down situations is critical if the Rams want to pull out this contest.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if this becomes a game in which Fort moves the ball with zest, it could be a long day for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this Central team has to put something on the scoreboard early in the third period.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad, in several games at the half this year, has fallen a bit flat offensively out of the third period gate.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That cannot be the scenario against the Lancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>…Central just needs to go with what works.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That method might not have produced the record the Rams were hoping for this season, but Blair has the ability to run some circles around the Lancers’ defense – especially if the first tackle isn’t cleanly made.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has the bell for a reason but this game is even-steven looking in from multiple fronts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that second elusive victory could be on the horizon for Central if Eastern is stopped offensively and the Rams rushes in some scores – especially over second half play. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Eastern is a good team,” said Papazian. “They’ve got a lot of answers over there. We’re going to have to play our best as always.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>And the winner is</strong>…Predictions are silly and if you’re into numbers, like&nbsp;<em>standout</em>&nbsp;math teacher Dave Greenleaf from Bristol Central is (he has enough trouble counting coins from Canada from what I’m told), go ask him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’ll say Eastern will win 3-2. And you can mark that down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you’re looking for an exciting game, this is one you should consider attending because it’s shaping up to be a competitive bout.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
