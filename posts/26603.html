<p>The Bristol lacrosse coop program defeated Middletown on Monday night, zipping up a 15-2 romp on the road to complete regular season play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s Brady Bell rocked the Blue Dragons for a hat trick while also adding an assist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ryan Spina, RJ Fellows, Ian Reardon, and Chase Dauphinee added two goals apiece to augment the winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goalie duo of Max Stavens and Nick Martino each snared four assists with the Bristol substitutes playing most of the second half against overwhelmed Middletown. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That effort ended an excellent regular season, leading to a couple postseason chances in tournament play to end the scholastic year.</p>

<p><strong>CCCs on deck</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, the Bristol lacrosse coop team gets its shot at the Southern Division championship at the Central Connecticut Conference Tournament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol program has been excellent this season, going 14-2 overall, winners of nine straight matches since dropping an 18-0 decision to Wethersfield on April 24.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol is on quite a roll since that setback against the Eagles, but the program also fell to Lewis Mills on April 17, dropping the match by a single goal (9-8) from Alumni Field on the campus of BEHS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s the opponent Bristol drew, battling against the Spartans on Tuesday afternoon in Burlington in CCC semifinal action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Mills and Bristol carry just two losses, falling to Wethersfield (14-10) and Northwest Catholic (21-8) back on May 9.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that means Bell, Dauphinee, Reardon, Fellows, Spina, Dylan Brown, Stavens and company are all looking to pull off the upset on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t forget, the crew from the Mum City has yet to taste defeat during the month of May.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Bristol can get by Lewis Mills, the squad will play the winner of Tolland/Wethersfield on Thursday for the Southern title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last season, the Bristol program was in the CCC mix, taking its shot against Tolland in tournament play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles zipped up a 17-3 win over Bristol while Tolland was smashed by Wethersfield over a 14-4 romp in the title tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
