<p>While the St Paul offense was pounding out 22 hits, including four home runs, three St. Paul pitchers (Joey Tonnotti, Chase Mendela, and Logan Rembish) threw a combined no hitter, striking out 17 and allowing Terryville only three baserunners the entire game. Starter Tonnotti picked up the win for the Falcons, while C J McIntyre took the loss for the Kangaroos.</p>

<p>After Tonnotti retired the side in order to start the game, St. Paul scored five in the bottom of the first to take an early lead. Devin Kulas singled to left on the first pitch that he saw, and stole 2nd to move into scoring position. Mario Izzo drove him in with an RBI single to make it 1-0. Casey Cerruto followed with his first home run of the day to make it 3-0. Then Joey Tonnotti went back-to-back with Cerruto to make it 4-0. Steve Morelli singled, stole 2nd, and advanced to 3rd when the catcher's throw went into center field. Chase Mendela hit a SAC fly to right driving in Morelli with the 5th run.</p>

<p>Tonnotti struck out the side in the top of the 2nd, and St. Paul added 6 more in the bottom of the frame. Terryville’s McIntyre did retire the first two batters of the inning, but then a solo home run by Ryan Daniels started a string of 7 Falcons reaching base safely. The string ended with Jamie Leggett's bases clearing double, and McIntyre's day was over. Brayden Evans came in to relieve McIntyre and get the final out of the inning, and St. Paul led 11-0.</p>
