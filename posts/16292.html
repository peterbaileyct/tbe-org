<p>Jay Pennito, 61, a lifelong resident of Bristol, Conn., passed away suddenly on Thursday, Aug. 18. Jay was born to Jack F. Pennito and Joan A. (Goski) Pennito in Bristol, where he was raised with his two older sisters Jan Pennito and Judy Sherman. He leaves behind his two children, Jack and Tracey Pennito, whom he loved deeply.</p>

<p>He worked for the City of Bristol for over 30 years and worked for the Bristol Water Department. He was able to enjoy his retirement over the last several years. When he wasn't tending to his prized tomato garden, Jay loved cooking, listening to music, and going to the beaches in Rhode Island. </p>

<p>As a tradition, he and his family rented a cottage by the shore each summer to enjoy the ocean together. On any given day, he could be found talking about his beloved sports teams, the Bruins, Steelers, Yankees, Knicks or Jets. He felt a strong emotional connection to children in need and those born less fortunate than him. He had a big heart.</p>

<p>Jay loved taking care of his family. He and his father, Jack (now 95), enjoyed going out to eat and playing at the casino. Jay loved animals, especially his late puppy, Patches. He was always the life of the party and lit up every room he entered. Singing Karaoke at the local bars brought him much joy. He was proud to be part of the Bristol community.</p>

<p>He is predeceased by his beloved mother, Joan Pennito, as well as several close friends. In addition to his father Jack, Jay is survived by his two children: Jack and Tracey Pennito, both of San Diego, Calif., whom he loved more than anything on earth; two sisters: Judy Sherman and her husband, Dan of Old Saybrook and Jan Pennito and her husband, George Brophy of New Britain; four nieces and nephews: Danny Paul Sherman of Tennessee, Jade Paradis of Old Saybrook, David Florian of California, and Amy Florian of Southington; and former spouse Emily Zadzilko Pennito of New Britain.</p>
