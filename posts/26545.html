<p>FARMINGTON - When the Bristol Eastern baseball team can get its bat on the ball, forcing opponents to react defensively, good things usually happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was the story on Wednesday night when the Lancers dropped overmatched Farmington by a 16-7 final from Tunxis Meade Park.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern moved to 5-11 on the campaign while Farmington fell to 6-11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers&nbsp;blasted out 16 hits, took advantage of seven Farmington errors, and received solid pitching from Ryan Maglio and Jonny Montgomery to snare the win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading the offense for the Lancers was Ben D'Amato, who had four hits, including a double, while scoring twice and driving in six RBI over his biggest effort of the campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio had three hits, along with a double, and drove in two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyle Babin, Owen Myers, and Rio Fernandez each generated two hits apiece while Maglio was clutch on the hill for the visiting aggression.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio pitched the first five innings before reaching the pitch count limit, earning the win in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed three hits, four runs (three earned), struck out eight while walking five.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Montgomery came on in relief in the sixth frame following a Maglio walk to open the inning, pitching the final two frames.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He allowed three hits, three runs (one earned) while striking out two over a solid hold.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern set the tone in the first inning, scoring two runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With two outs, D'Amato and Maglio both singled and came around to score via two Farmington infield errors, making it a 2-0 game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers then added four runs in the second, six runs in the fifth, and four final runs in the seventh to score its season high of 16.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, Eastern batted around,&nbsp;taking advantage of three additional Farmington miscues, scoring four times to seize a 6-0 lead.&nbsp; D'Amato had a two-run single in the inning as the River Hawks had a lot of catching up to do.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington put together three hits in the bottom of the third to trim the deficit to 6-2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an odd play, with runners on first and third, Farmington’s Tom Keough broke for second, got caught in a run down, but Bryan LaDuke scored from third on the play while Keough was awarded second base on an interference call - eventually leading to two runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Kingstreeters were back at it during the third frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato opened the inning with a single to right, and Maglio followed with a long double to left to put runners on second and third with no outs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, two strikeouts and a pop out ended the threat, but the offense would come later in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fourth frame, the Lancers struck for six runs on five hits - seizing a 12-3 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a walk, an infield error, and a hit batter that loaded the bases with no one out, Connor Cyr's slow roller past the mound went for a base-hit to score a run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>D'Amato then cleared the bases with a long double to right center, notching three runs, as the lead was 10-3 in Eastern’s favor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio followed with a single up the middle to score pinch runner Mike Roalf, and Caleb Molinsky's infield hit scored pinch runner Cooper Porrini as Eastern went up 12-3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Farmington scored twice in the sixth to trim the deficit to 12-5 but the Lancers added insurance tallies in the seventh.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern scored its four runs over the final frame on just two hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bases were loaded with no outs following an infield single by Fernandez, an outfield error, and a walk to load the bases up once again.&nbsp; Montgomery drove in the first run with a sacrifice fly and then a single by Babin reloaded the bases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both&nbsp;Gabe White and pinch hitter Matthew Harkey were hit by pitches, plating two additional runs, and then the final tally came on a sacrifice fly&nbsp;from D’Amato to give the Lancers its ultimate 16-7 triumph and victory number five.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
