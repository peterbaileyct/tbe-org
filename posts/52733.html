<p>Hayrides, pumpkin picking, apple cider making, crafting were only part of the attractions at this year's Fall Family Festival at Indian Rock Nature Preserve this past weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was also the preserve's 280 acres of animal barns, lake, trails and Native American wigwams to explore. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I saw the festival sign on our way to the park and I decided to change plans," said Peter Cherepanov, who brought his three young children, Lily, Sofia and Hannah for the first time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family-friendly event emphasized fun hands-on learning experiences, encouraging visitors to bond with nature and appreciate the outdoors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Families piled on to the festival’s hayride, a 20-minute ride sitting on hay bales to have an open air 360-degree vista of the forest and lake during prime fall leaves season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the tractor ride comes to its first stop at the two wigwams nestled in the woods, everyone piles out into the colored leaf forest to explore.</p>

<p>Isabella Daley helped children make corn husk dolls in front of one of the Nature Preserve’s wigwams. It was her first-year volunteering for the festival. Friends Marjolein Ross and Kathy Westmoreland, from Canton, are in their 20th year as member volunteers. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I love this place. It's a great environment for kids to learn about nature” Ross said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Westmoreland wore Native American regalia she made from buckskin and accessorized with porcupine quill jewelry she purchased on a trip to the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I dress to honor the Native Americans and to help people understand their culture,” she said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The friends instructed and interacted with attendees, alternating between the wigwam and their demo table of Indian artifacts, baskets, jewelry and musical instruments.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A little farther down the path from the wigwams is the Pebble House, a stone building where Jeff Hatch conducted an introduction of his Raven Wilderness School where he teaches traditional bushcraft and survival skills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I am exhibiting primitive tools, friction fire tools and animal hides,” said Hatch as the Nolin family took interest in the animal hides and tried to guess the animal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Children proudly donned their Wilderness School badges as they continued down the path to meet back up with the hayride back to the main festivities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After much exploring and learning, many children gravitated to face painting, and the big leaf pile and lawn games set amidst the barn animals. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Garden paths trimmed by a sprinkling of themed craft vendors added to the ambience on the beautiful fall day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fall Family Festival at the Indian Rock Nature Preserve is an annual celebration of fall traditions and a learning opportunity about the region's history and indigenous heritage.</p>
