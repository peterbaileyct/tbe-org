<p>Police are seeking information about seeing or witnessing persons posting cardboard signs promoting white-nationalist propaganda including contact information along the block of 597 Farmington Avenue.</p>

<p>The signs were removed after Bristol police responded to a call on Monday from a concerned citizen who reported seeing the signs, according to a joint release from the Bristol Police Dept. and the mayor's office.</p>

<p>Last year, around the beginning of June, leaflets promoting white supremacism were dropped in the Northeast section of Bristol.
