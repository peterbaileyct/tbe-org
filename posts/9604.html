<p>BRISTOL - There’s not a team around that can slow down Bristol Central’s Victor Rosa on the football field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s just a fact of life but the defensive crew at Bristol Eastern did the best it could on Thanksgiving to slow down Rosa and the arsenal of weapons that surrounds him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while the 38-8 loss might not seem like the Lancers had much success on the field on the defensive end, the locals had standouts that limited the Rams to just 16 first half points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s junior crew of Austin Shorette, Kyle Babin and Jeremy Kolloverja - who also did a tremendous job at quarterback along with senior Alex Marshall - all helped to make stops along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That trio compiled nearly a dozen tackles against the crafty Central offense - including two tackles for losses, good for seven yards lost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fellow juniors Kyle Babin, Connor Gimpl, and Cooper Harris all chipped in defensively as that grouping finished the campaign on a high note despite the tough ending to the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve been guys for us all year,’ said Eastern coach Anthony Julius of his defensive standouts from the junior class. “Kids have stepped up and they’ve played and they’ve done a really, really nice job. The junior class has been rock solid for us, along with our seniors, and right now, we’re looking forward to, obviously, more from them in the future.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the contest, as always on Thanksgiving, belonged to the senior class - honored before the game along with senior cheerleaders Alexsia Newman and Xsiah Rohena.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dylan Bradley, Leon Chatelle, Joseph Davis, Cameron Goodman, Nashon Pryce, Malik Sherill, and Nathan Shorette all played in their final scholastic game for the Lancers - helping the program to its best record since 2014 (7-4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That success had a ton to do with captains Conor McCormick, Luke Dauphinee, Alex Vita and Marshall as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The squad had strong leadership, played as a team and developed tremendous chemistry along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just two misses, in losses at Plainville and at home in overtime to South Windsor, prevented the Lancers from capturing a .500 ledger - or better this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that outstanding senior core helped move the program in the right direction as the junior class has some big shoes to fill in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve been great all year,” said Julius of his senior class. “They’ve been tremendous leaders. They’ve helped elevate the program. They’ve certainly left this program in better place than when they found it. I’m hoping that their leadership and the work ethic that they instilled is going to help carry our younger classes forward.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have good junior class that our seniors were able to lead along with our sophomores and freshmen so I’ve very appreciative of the work they’ve put in.”</p>
