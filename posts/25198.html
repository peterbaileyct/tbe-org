<p>Born and raised in Grand Falls, Canada, he came to the States after serving in the Canadian Army to create a better life. While he was always proud of his Canadian heritage and would still call Canada home, he was honored to become a US citizen in 2008. He joined the Carpenter’s Union and spent over 40 years mastering his beloved woodworking craft. He was best known for his boards and bowls that now reside in the homes of those he loved. </p>

<p>Service was a pillar of Ron’s life. He was privileged to serve as a member of the Rifle Honor Guard team for the American Legion Seicheprey Post 2, and you could often find him sporting his uniform following memorials. He was also a member of the Korean War Veterans Association and the Franco-American War Veterans. </p>

<p>A man of faith, he was very involved in his church. He spent many devoted moments of his life serving St. Ann Church and the greater Bristol community. He was a known name to many, and if you were lucky to cross Ron’s path, you had a friend in him for life.</p>
