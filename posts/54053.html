<p>Teas the Season: A Holiday Tea, will be held at the American Clock &amp; Watch Museum on Sunday, December 8th from 3:00-5:00.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Held in conjunction with the museum's annual “Mantels for the Season,” the event is planned as a great way for attendees to relax with friends over a delightfully elegant afternoon tea, while viewing the beautiful mantel displays. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike the museum's annual New Year's Madhatter tea for children that is held to usher in the New Year, this event is for adults looking for an extra-special way to usher in the holiday season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catered by Cravings of Bristol, the menu will include traditional tea sandwiches, scones, desserts, and tea, of course!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to the festive decorations and delightfully delicious tea, there will be a teacup drawing and the museum shop will be filled with unique gifts, to help guests get some shopping done, too!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tickets to A Holiday Tea are $50 per person, ages 12+. They can be purchased by calling the museum—860-583-6070--or by stopping by the museum, Wednesday through Sunday, 10-5. Please note: Due to the nature of the event, we regret that we will not be able to accommodate food allergies. Tickets to the event are not refundable.</p>
