<p>MANSFIELD – The Bristol Eastern girls lacrosse team made it two wins in a row on Monday afternoon, flipping Edwin O. Smith by a 4-2 final from Farrell Field Park in Mansfield in a CCC South showdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dropping their first two matches, the Lancers moved to 2-2 overall with the triumph over the Panthers (0-3).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern had to battle all the elements in an up-and-down affair as each team had difficulty getting into any kind of flow due to a tough ground ball game and several whistles that stopped play dead in its tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But any time a team can limit another program to just two goals scored, it makes for an outstanding day on the field for the victors.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the Lancers' first road win of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The credit belonged to Eastern keeper Avery Ellis and defensive standouts Jayna Hatcher and Carolyn Wilson. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defense held firm over the tremendous winning effort and offensively, all the usual suspects were at it again for the Lancers.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury hustled for two early goals while Emma Stavens and Kenzie Aparo each chipped in one score apiece later in the match for a little insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kate Patterson also played extremely well for the Eastern contingent.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next up for the Lancers is a date at Enfield – another CCC South competitor on Thursday (1 p.m.) – and don’t forget about Monday’s city series special against St. Paul Catholic in a huge non-conference tilt.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Match time is set for 3:45 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Girls lacrosse in the CCC is a bit spread out in terms of divisions. Eastern and Bristol Central compete in the CCC South along with Lewis Mills, Edwin O. Smith, Enfield, Middletown and Wethersfield. Smith and Enfield require extra gas and additional snacks for the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
