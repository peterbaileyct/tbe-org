<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - Is it already time for the second showdown between the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern boys basketball teams?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like the two programs tangled just yesterday but it’s actually been quite some time since the Rams and Lancers have clashed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That contest from the Central Holiday Classic just after Christmas saw Eastern roll up a 49-44 win from the Charles C. Marsh Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And bluntly, Central would like to square up the season series tonight at Eastern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that’s going to be a tall order from the Lancers home court at the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s what to expect on Monday night when the two public school programs in town hit the court:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Central Boys Basketball</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Central at Eastern - The Rematch the Rams have been waiting for</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Last Time versus Eastern:&nbsp;</strong>Central’s Carmelo Thompson dropped in a game-high 17 points, but it was Eastern that came away with a five-point triumph back on December 27.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Players to Watch – Bristol Central (5-14 overall)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jayeson VanBeveren (sr, forward/center), Carmelo Thompson (so, guard), Mike McMahon (jr, guard) out with an illness, Tre Blair (sr, guard), Mike Allan (sr, guard), Jonmanuel Gomez (sr, forward), Mason Stokes (sr, guard), Joey Pikiell (so, guard), Aiden Lopez (so, guard).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Out of the Gate:&nbsp;</strong>In talking with Barrette a couple days before the game, he knows his squad can keep this thing close and that’s all you can ask for in a city series showdown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he’ll have to accomplish it without the services of long-range dynamo Mikey McMahon who is out with an illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His long-range show will have to come from the likes of Joey Pikiell and defensive-minded Aiden Lopez who has earned more minutes as the season has gone on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loss of Central’s leading three-point shooter and third leading scorer puts added pressure on others to score but Rams can make up for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mike Allan will get a chance to steal the ball a time or two and perhaps even flash in a lay-up while&nbsp;Mason Stokes will see the floor as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The program enters the Eastern contest on a bit of a losing streak after a promising 5-4 start which included that 100-47 farce at Windsor back on January 10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since a tough 52-49 setback at Xavier back on January 20, the Rams have dropped nine straight though three of those setbacks came off single possessions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spotlight on Bristol Central:</strong>&nbsp;Carmelo Thompson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all have to remember he’s still just a sophomore and Thompson is going to have ups and downs every young player experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He averages right around 10.0 points-per-game and is a terror in the paint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson can hit the midrange jumper, drop in a 3 every once in a while, and has the ability to score in the paint over a variety of ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And he’s not afraid of the big shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His playmaking is underrated, and he nabs his share of rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When his team is in need, the shooter is more than willing to take all the big shots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a good showing in mop-up minutes last year at Eastern, hitting for a quick six points as a freshman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thompson is a handful and Eastern has to defend him from the jump-ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Under-the-radar Guy</strong>:&nbsp;Joey Pikiell.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know about the McMahon blood that has ruled the scholastic basketball scene around these parts.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Pikiell can make a similar boast as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a three-point marksman and one of the top long-range shooters on the squad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through 15 games this season, Pikiell averaged just over five points and canned 18 threes along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of those trifectas came against Eastern as Pikiell splashed in one - right in front of the Central bench - with 28.4 seconds to play against the Lancers, trimming the deficit to 45-43 via the corner 3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pikiell got the start against East Catholic to end the month of January and looked like former Boston Celtics All-Star Danny Ainge at the 3-point shooting contest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Pikiell just made one 3 that evening against the Eagles, all his attempts looked like they could have gone in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a guy is capable of 20-point game if his shot is flowing and leaving him open would be a mistake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Watch out for:&nbsp;</strong>Jayeson VanBeveren&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will there be a bigger inside-outside threat on the court from the Thomas M. Monahan Gymnasium than VanBeveren on Monday night?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior is looking for a big regular season finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a double-double threat with range, averaging a healthy 13 points-per-game while draining over one 3 a game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>VanBeveren has enjoyed plenty of good moments from the campus of BEHS over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On last season’s state title team, Van Beveren toasted the Lancers for six points in just under two minutes of varsity action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has that kind of strike ability in Central’s vaunted high-low offense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hr played in 26 of Central’s 28 games over its title run last year and he has tons of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If VanBeveren is allowed to finish in paint and then makes his way behind the three-point line for big buckets, Eastern’s is going to be in some trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong>Forget Bristol Central’s current record. Toss it right out the window.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t matter that the Rams have lost nine straight games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t make a different who Central has won or lost against.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams have been playing better than its 5-14 ledger indicates and this crew is going to give the Lancers plenty of fits - and then some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barrette’s senior crew is going to go out fighting over its final regular season game of the year before preparing for its postseason battle against Northwest Catholic in CIAC Division I play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This city series showdown should be a good one no matter how you slice it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NOTES…</strong>Injured senior center Julius Powell, in a pregame arrangement between Barrette and Bristol Eastern head coach Bunty Ray, is going to be allowed to score the first hoop of the game off the jump ball. Powell, a member of Central’s 2021-22 CIAC Division II state champions, suffered a season ending injury while competing on the football team and missed the entire hoops season for the Rams. </p>
