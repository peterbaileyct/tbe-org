<p>BRISTOL – Bristol Eastern’s baseball squad was bested by Platt on Monday afternoon, falling by a 12-2 final in six innings from Clem J. Roy Field on the campus of Bristol Eastern High School.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers are now 3-5 overall while the Lancers dropped to 2-5.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, Platt hit the ball hard all game and added slick pitching – a good combination for sure that led to doom and demise for the Kingstreers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Ryan Maglio earned the start on the hill and&nbsp;walked the bases full in the first frame with one out but nearly got out of the jam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he ended up yielding a three-run double to right by Dylan Link – propelling the Panthers to a 3-0 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Lancers had a couple responses over the next two innings to almost draw even.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Gabe White led off the bottom of the first with a single to left, stole second, and with two outs, he scored on a single to right by Maglio to trim the deficit to 3-1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first inning continued as Jose Feliciano followed with a single to left with Maglio stopping at second to put two runners on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caleb Molinsky then singled to center, but Maglio was gunned down at the plate to end the inning with Platt still ahead by two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the second stanza, the Lancers were at it again offensively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rio Fernandez led off with a triple to deep left and scored on a groundout to make it a 3-2 game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, after the three-base hit by Fernandez, the game belonged to winning pitcher Ryan Zauner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He retired 12 batters in a row from the second through the fifth frames and in-between, the Panthers zipped up eight runs to the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt added a run in the third to go up 4-2 and then in the fifth, the visiting aggression put the game away for good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Panthers marched eleven batters to the plate, scoring seven times on six hits off three&nbsp;BE pitchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With one away, Maglio gave up three singles to load the bases, and Owen Myers came in to throw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Myers gave up a two-run single to big Hunter Sincovic, and then an intentional walk, a run scoring single to Zauner and after a bases-loaded walk, Noah Gatti came in to pitch for Eastern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gatti generated an out, but Jayden Gaither's bases clearing double to deep left gave Platt an 11-2 lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the Panthers added a run in the sixth to go up 12-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Platt reliever Brandon Candelora pitched a scoreless sixth, allowing just a two-out walk to Feliciano, the only Eastern baserunner since the second inning, to seal the deal as the home team fell by 10 runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers look to get back to the pay window on Wednesday with a trip to Meriden against Maloney.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 3:45 from Maloney High School.</p>
