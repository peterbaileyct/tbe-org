<p>It’s great to be back in writing about Bristol, its citizens, leaders, volunteers and institutions that we have in making us stand out. Thank you to the Bristol Edition for taking me in</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Longtime friends and teammates enter GHTBL Hall of Fame </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adam Peters, a construction safety director, and Bunty Ray, longtime baseball coach at Bristol Central, were inducted into the GHTBL Hall of Fame on Saturday, Nov. 18 at the Indian Hill Country Club in Newington. They were teammates on the Bristol Merchants. Bunty told me at the recent Bristol Sports Hall of Fame dinner: “We are going to introduce each other.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s, “Pretty cool,” as our late friend Dave Lepore would have stated. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the way, they had also played together at Bristol Eastern.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first go to: Joe Filippi, Tim Dudzinski and Marty Hurwitz for their assistance in helping me the other day.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Spotlight</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s spotlight is on Bill Laser, a member of the class of ‘63 at Bristol Easter. Bill resided in the Torrington/Thomaston area for a long time before moving to Florida as a widower in recent years. I’ve known Bill since our Stafford School days, and he’s been a solid citizen for all of this time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very likable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may recall Laser’s variety store in Bristol, which later housed Bob’s Chalet off of Farmington Avenue on the short roadway between Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dunkin Donuts. I can remember being a grammar school kid trying to purchase a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes from Mrs. Laser when I was a kid.</p>

<p>You know her reply!!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">TV notables</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s always interesting or enjoyable seeing Bristol folks when they appear on TV. Some of those seen recently have been Adrian Wojnarowski (ESPN), Malcolm Huckaby (ESPN), Donovan Clingan (UConn hoops) and Bristol Fire Department Deputy Chief Mark Martin. The latter was on duty when the deadly Stevens Street car crash took place.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
