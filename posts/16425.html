<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will be joining the family for a weekend on the Connecticut shore. It’s the first time that we have vacationed as a family, or at least that was the plan. The initiative of the second child, the idea is to foster in a new family tradition. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, the third child and his partner have departed these shores for Australia—at the time the long weekend was planned, the departure date was problematic. The oldest and family, also in the meantime, found that their new schedule includes dad commuting into the city, as in New York City, for work, and mom heading to Boston.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Needless to say, the later will be joining us for an afternoon, and the former perhaps on a FaceTime session. Ah, “the best laid plans of mouse and men often go astray.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that, TBE introduced a couple of new features this past week. One is our Spotlight Photo, for which we hope readers will respond with some photos and a paragraph about the photo: when it was, where it was, who is in it, how it was you came across it, why it caught your attention. Submit it to <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A second feature is “Good morning, Bristol!” a daily greeting on weekdays with a brief hello, a photo of Bristol, a look ahead at the weather, something about what to expect from our articles for that day and possibly some Bristol trivia.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, there is a humor column by Sacco &amp; Vanzetti, deceased TBE correspondents, which should be an indication to the readers that they are in for some interesting, if not, edgy commentary.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, it is not a new feature, but we did have one Letter to the Editor, so this is a reminder that letters are welcome. Our letters policy requires the letters to run no longer than 450 words, anything longer will be edited for length, or but also possibly considered for a guest essay; personal (ad hominem) attacks will not be accepted—stick to issues; all letters will be edited for style. Please send the letter, via email to <a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>. In addition, all letters should include a name and address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I won’t be able to attend, but I will be interested in how the “Victorian Fantasy in the Park” is received. The event&nbsp;is the introduction, to Bristol,&nbsp;of Steampunk, a cultural movement focusing on 19th-century literature and culture with a quirky twist. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For reading/listening this week, here is a podcast, “Ones &amp; Tooze,” featuring economist Adam Tooze discussing the world economy. Tooze teaches at Columbia University. He has a knack for breaking down big ideas into intelligible bite-sized bits, but what’s interesting about this episode, “What the Fluctuating Oil and Gas Prices Mean for the World,” while from July, provides some perspective on how the world and oil prices work.

<p>Until next week!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;<em>“Come Sunday morning” is intended to be a weekly review, a recounting of the past week and an anticipation of week to come. Among its features will be reviews of old and new books, sharing of favorite podcasts, some family news, Bristol events and happenings and issues surrounding education, work and community journalism. He can be reached at&nbsp;</em><strong><em>dfortier@bristoledition.org.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All TBE readers, supporters and donors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Non-members will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access&nbsp;eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.</em>&nbsp;<em>People with financial difficulties may write&nbsp;</em><a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>editor@bristoledition.org</em></strong></a><em>&nbsp;to be considered for free access.</em>&nbsp;</p>
