<p>WETHERSFIELD - Over the second half of its season, the baseball program over at Bristol Eastern has pulled off a couple big upsets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, another opponent bit the dust as this time, it was the team from Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers were able to spin the Eagles by a 6-3 final from Esposito Field&nbsp;in Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern (8-11) automatically qualified for the postseason while Wethersfield, winners of 15 of its first 17 games, fell to 15-5 to end its campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were standouts all over the field for the Lancers as the visiting aggression got to the pay window with some inspirational play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern got five innings of excellent relief from Jaydon Churchill, pitching for the first time since April 27 when he threw a 5-2 gem against Maloney in a winning effort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relieving starter Mike Roalf with no outs in the third inning and the bases loaded, Churchill walked in two runs but then pitched shutout ball the rest of the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill allowed just three singles, struck out three, and no walks after those two free passes in the third tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there was Connor Cyr with a run scoring single in the third and a two run, two-strike, base hit in the seventh when the Lancers picked up two insurance runs to snare its 6-3 edge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After three miscues against Central, Eastern played errorless ball against Wethersfield.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individually, Churchill made a slick play to end the second stanza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill, starting the showdown at third base with a runner on and two outs, charged a bunt down the third base line by Nick Farrelly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The senior captain made a perfect throw to first to get Farrelly to help shutdown a rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Conor McCormick made a circus catch going away in deep center on a ball hit by the Eagles Cam Righi to end the fourth frame.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the fifth, when Noah Terzo led off with a single to left, the runner was cut down trying to reach second base via an excellent relay from Ben D'Amato to Cole Latko to Elliot Norris for the out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Offensively, Cyr had two hits and three RBI while Preston Guarda added two hits to pace the Lancers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first and never trailed again.&nbsp; Churchill singled to right center, stole second, and came in to score on Guarda's single that was grounded between first and second base - making it 1-0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield tied the game in the bottom of the inning on a rundown off a pickoff attempt, allowing a runner from third to score.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters then scored three times in the third to take a 4-1 push.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norris led off by reaching first on an infield error and later moved to third on a wild pickoff throw.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He scored as McCormick beat out an infield single to short for an RBI tally and a 2-1 Eastern lead.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McCormick then stole second and Cyr’s single to center scored the lead runner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, Guarda beat out an infield single on a slow chopper to third and D'Amato doubled to deep left to score Cyr as the Lancers scooped up a 4-1 cushion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wethersfield pitcher Chris Morales pitched well after that three run third, retiring eleven in a row through the end of the sixth inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bottom of the third saw Roalf allow two walks and a single to load the bases for Wethersfield, ending his afternoon on the hill.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After getting a strikeout, Churchill walked the next two batters, both on full counts, to force in two Wethersfield runs that trimmed Eastern’s edge to 4-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no further damage was done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The game remained 4-3 in the top of the seventh as Eastern struck for two more runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Latko started the drive with a single to right while Norris sacrificed him to second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runner moved to third on a wild pitch and after McCormick was intentionally walked, he stole second.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then walked to load the bases with Cyr at the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Cyr singled to left for two RBI and to push Eastern to a 6-3 tilt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Churchill then retired the Eagles in order in the seventh as the Lancers earned a big three run win in Wethersfield.</p>
