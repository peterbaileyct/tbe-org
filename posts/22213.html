<p>Grand architecture, state-of-the-art technology and creative spaces provide cultural enrichment for students, staff and community members at Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School (BAIMS).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have good community participation here and this space has been well received,” said Dr. Michael Dietter. “We already have communities in our gymnasium doing yoga; we have Freshman and J.V. teams practicing here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dietter is the Deputy Superintendent of Bristol Public Schools.</p>

<p>Students who attend BAIMS have several pathways to choose from, including visual arts, creative construction and theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The pathways that we’ve developed for our middle and high school students, five of them have a university partner,” said Dietter. “When we look at college credit for advanced placement, conceivably our students who attend all four years here could have several credits taken care of before they get to college.”</p>

<p>The BAIMS Art Gallery is adorned in reclaimed marble from the Bristol High School’s old locker rooms and swimming areas. The creative space was home to the first BAIMS art show last month, featuring work organized and created by high school senior Pushpita Hossain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One of our students, Pushpita, curated the show,” said Dietter. “We had some of her original art, as well as artwork from some staff and local professional artists.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The art gallery is one of the spaces that will be available for the community to rent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students who choose the theater path will have the opportunity to perform at both of the facility’s fully functional theaters: the black box theater and Rockwell Theater.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rockwell Theater features 621 seats, box office and fully functional concession stand. Updates to the historic theater include ADA compliant seating, live-feed monitors and a grand lighting fixture restored from the original theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The light is original to the building,” said Dietter. It was restored by Melnick Metal Works in town. That was removed and had to be substantially restored to come up to compliance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The original light fixture was made in Bristol’s J.H. Sessions Foundry in 1920.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Students also have the opportunity to study vocal music and instrumental music. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access eight (8) articles per week.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you. Email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:editor@bristoledition.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editor@bristoledition.org</a>&nbsp;for instructions. Sorry for any inconvenience.
