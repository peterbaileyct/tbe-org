<p>CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND - A trip to Rhode Island is usually in the cards each season for the Bristol Eastern wrestling team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means the annual <strong>John D. Gorman Tournament</strong> was off and running from Cumberland, Rhode Island.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this time around, the Lancers earned the runner-up trophy off a tremendous finish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kingstreeters tallied second place with 179 total points, losing to tournament champion, and Connecticut state power New Milford.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Green Wave won the tournament by scoring 253 points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers had an individual champion while a number of athletes earned second place medals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four grapplers from Eastern made it to the finals as Yussuf Bah (106 pounds) ended up winning his division.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He generated a pinfall victory in 1:45 to take the 106 title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also in the championship round, Luke Viens (132) was in the mix against New Milford’s Tyler Roussel - losing via a 14-9 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At 190 pounds, Aidan Davies went the distance against Aaron Bolduc from Lincoln, Rhode Island but fell by a 3-0 decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, at 215 pounds, the Lancers’ Rio Fernandez was pinned by Christopher Reiss from New Milford in 2:50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In third place bouts, the Lancers had three wrestlers looking for wins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andrew Brown (120) lasted into the second round but was pinned by North Attleborough’s Braeden Thrasher in 4:10.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern’s Rocco Barbino (150) fell by a 16-1 technical fall and at 175, Owen Broyles battled to the end against Benjamin Johnson-McMahon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Broyles hung in but ended up dropping a tough 9-4 decision over a very successful out-of-state trip for the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
