<p>BRISTOL – With one win in four tries, the Bristol Central football team has been competitive over a tough slate of games.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central is still looking for its first CCC Tier II victory of the season but it’s just tough going with Berlin, Manchester, Wethersfield and Middletown on the docket in October and early November.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an eventful month of September that was just put in the books.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of Central’s games to date as the program took on several different and unique challengers:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 1 – (at Windsor, September 10): Windsor 43, Bristol Central 0&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central trailed 9-0 from the start and ended up falling against what should have been a top-10 program at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor gained 250 total yards while Central was limited to 37.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his first contest for the Rams, Jack Hartley made 4-of-9 passes while rushing the ball 13 times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tristan Toussaint, Jayden Glasper, Aiden Lamarre, Cassias Breland, Donato Salzillo and Ty Chasse all carried the ball in Central’s debut game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 2 – (at New Britain, September 15): New Britain 13, Bristol Central 6&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*The showdown turned into a defensive war with the Hurricanes hanging on to a one-possession win after a scoreless first half of play.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Britain led 7-6 going into the third frame and added another score late in the game to tally the victory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And thanks to the weather the previous weekend, it was a very short week for the Rams.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central had chances but missed opportunities – including two balls lost via fumbles – kept the visitors from snaring their first win.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams had a bit more total yardage than the Hurricanes (249-229) and that included a supreme effort by Hartley.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The junior churned out 32 huge carries for 112 yards – his first ever 100-yard rushing game on the scholastic level.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Toussaint nabbed 74 yards on nine carries for a score while Glasper added 36 yards on 10 carries.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glasper had the only successful pass on the night, making a 17-yard connection within Quincy Lawson.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 3 – (vs. Fairfield Warde, September 22): Bristol Central 42, Fairfield Warde 13&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Hartley went for 160 yards (on 27 carries) and two touchdowns while Anthony Paulino (two carries, 74 yards) scored TDs each time he rushed with the ball as the Rams won their home opener.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams out-gained Warde 401-202 as the visiting contingent couldn’t keep pace in a Connecticut Alliance Football game in Bristol.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Toussaint added 10-plus yards a carry (six rushes, 61 yards) and Glasper rushed for 35 yards –each scoring a touchdown.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defense ruled the day as Ward was held to negative first half rushing yardage as Central set the defensive tone of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central led 20-0 at the half and never looked back.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Week 4 – (at Enfield, September 29): Enfield 28, Bristol Central 14&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Central started off well, tied up with Enfield at the half (14-14) before the offense came up dry over the third and fourth periods.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles outgained the Rams 235-165 though Enfield was penalized for 90 yards compared to 28 by Central.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams led 6-0 through one quarter while scoring again in the second but Enfield added two scores to knot up the game at the break.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Eagles notched single touchdowns over third and fourth period play to snare the 14-point triumph, leading Central to its current 1-3 ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartley led the squad with 24 carries for 59 yards and a TD.&nbsp;</p>
