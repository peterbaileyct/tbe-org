<p>MANCHESTER -- Both the Bristol Central and Bristol Eastern girls cross country programs braved the heat at the 2023 CIAC championships from Wickham Park in Manchester on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The unseasonable weather got to several runners and made the title bouts a real mess that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the girls at Central, the squad didn’t have a full team to take on the elements, but the unit did well with a smaller crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The girls unfortunately only had four racing today due to illness and injury,” said Central coach Tamara Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three runners managed to cross the finish line for the Rams in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Katie Tran finished the day in 71st place with a time of 23:51 while teammate&nbsp;Emersyn Mazzei (25:14) nabbed 89th overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also for Central, Ruth Smith completed the course at Wickham that afternoon, taking 111th place overall with a finish of 27:43.</p>

<p>Newington’s Katherine Bohlke (19:00) won the Class L race while the Sherry’s – Tess and Liv – finished the contest in second (19:43) and third place (19:51), respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The girls were down a few due to sickness and injury but Captain Katie Tran led the team like the amazing leader she is,” said Stafford-Kirk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the Eastern girls, the program finished in 14th place with 356 points overall.</p>

<p>Eastern junior&nbsp;Kaydence Meyer took 66th place with a time of 25:51, senior Lauren Ayotte roped up 73rd place in 26:10 during her final championship event of her scholastic career while sophomore Kaelyn Gonzalez (76th, 26:28) wasn’t far behind.</p>

<p>The Kingstreeters also saw Rita Gao (81st, 26:44), Calliope Gallagher (88th, 27:29) and Brooklynne Whitlock (103rd, 27:29) round out the day for the locals.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
