<p>“A lot of people were excited for this show,” she said. “It’s definitely something patrons like. We had a lot of people come in for other comedy shows that are here for this one,” said, “so comedy is clearly something that people want to see. I think that's something that we're going to be definitely having more of at the Theater. We have two big comedy shows in the springtime and it’s something that our audience really likes.”</p>

<p>The evening’s lineup included sets from Daily Show writers Randall Otis, Kat Radley, and Joe Opio, all of whom are known for their witty, engaging personalities and distinctive comedic styles. Comedian Dave Ross, creator of the podcast <em>Billionaires Are Good</em>, hosted the show, setting the tone with his opening set before handing the stage over to the featured performers.</p>

<p>“I personally love the Daily Show and I’ve been a fan for a long time. I thought this was a big name that would draw a crowd to our theater which not a lot of people still know about. We got some new patrons come here tonight that may not have ever come here. Honestly, I think the comedians tonight are all funny,” Therriault said. “I love Kat (Radley), I’ve always thought she was great, and it was cool to meet her and have her here.”  </p>
