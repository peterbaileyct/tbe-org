<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MERIDEN –&nbsp;The return of Leah Roy to the Bristol Eastern girls basketball team was a welcomed sight on Friday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy, fully recovered from her ACL tear, was a familiar sight in the starting lineup - returning for the squad’s eleventh game of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Roy helped the Kingstreeters win in a romp, flipping the Spartans in a 48-19 push from Francis T. Maloney High School in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern improved to 9-2 overall while Maloney, in a bit of a youth movement, fell to 1-8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy’s debut saw the senior rack up four points, eight rebounds and three steals over a busy first game return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her insertion back into the lineup gives the Lancers added depth but also gave a couple freshmen competitors tons of experience via on-court play before Roy was cleared to resume play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or course, all the usual suspects hit the hardwood with zest for the Lancers in Meriden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autumn Udoh had another tremendous showing, just three steals shy of a triple double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She dropped in a game-high 19 points to go along with 12 rebounds, five blocked shots and seven steals as Udoh dominated play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amanda Noel chipped in eight points, six rebounds, a couple blocks and four steals while Lauren Ayotte - who apparently enjoys playing in Meriden - added seven points and four rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanessa Drury hit a hoop but also had a 10-assist outing while stealing the ball five times as she played well on both sides of the ball.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Off the pine, Cassie Sward had three points and three steals, Savannah Drury hit a 3, Natalia added a bucket while Alaina Joy added two rebounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenna Azab, Emily Zurowski and Rabiatu Bah all saw action for the Kingstreeters that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maloney center Amaya McNeil (13 points) caused some havoc with her rebounding and shot blocking but it was Eastern’s team defense that stole the show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Spartans missed 26-of-34 field goals, failed to hit a 3 and was in a 10-0 hole before finally getting on the scoreboard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was all catch-up from there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Roy hit her first hoop, off an offensive rebound and put-back, with 4:57 to play in the first period and when Vanessa Drury found Udoh for a jumper to end the frame, the Lancers were in front 12-2.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The edge was stretched to 16-2 off free throws by Sward and Ayotte and between baskets from McNeil, Eastern was still in complete control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Savannah Drury drained a baseline 3, Roy canned a jumper and when Noel grabbed a rebound and put it back, the Kingsteeters were in complete control at 23-4 with 1:14 remaining before the half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lay-up by McNeil trimmed the deficit to 14 early in the third tilt but it was all Eastern from there off the power of a 10-2 run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The jaunt was swiftly put out of reach when Noel found Ayotte for a foul line jumper and with 2:13 showing ion the clock in the third, the Lancers lead was twenty-two points (33-11).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading 35-13 with eight minutes to play, Udoh hit a hoop, Vanessa Drury put back a miss and when Drury found Ayotte for a hoop and later Udoh for a blistering three-pointer with 4:54 to play, Eastern was ahead by twenty-nine points (44-15) with just over two minutes left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To end the game, Sward dropped in a layup and when Vye ended the scoring with a put-back bucket, Eastern nabbed a huge 48-19 victory with Bristol Central on tap next Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
