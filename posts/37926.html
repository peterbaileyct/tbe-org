<p>"We Need a Little Christmas" is the theme of the 18th annual "Holiday Showcase of Stars" to be held Saturday, Dec. 2, at St. Paul Catholic High School. The grand finale is devoted to peace, said director Deb Schur.</p>

<p>"We felt both really covered the current mood and needs of people," Schur said about the volunteers who work behind the scenes, of the show which features local talent and raises funds for Bristol's Catholic schools.</p>

<p>"The show is packed with talent and the kids chorus is relatively young," Schur said, "but they are mini yet mighty, with some amazing little voices. Sweet group of kids."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The show begins with Christian Micari and the children's chorus filling the stage.</p>

<p>"Of course, Allen Stone and Maria Salice, who is our music director, always shine, along with Tammi Naudus, Andrea Ibanez and Shayna Swain who will all be singing solos," Schur said.</p>

<p>This year there are several newcomers, Wayne Morgan and Silvio Dagastino. But there are also those who are returning to the Showcase of Stars family.</p>

<p>"It's always so rewarding to see the kids grow up with the show, like Isabella Cadogen, or Nick Woods who started at age 5 and is back now, as a soloist and an adult," Schur said. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doors open at 6 p.m. The show starts at 7 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for kids under 13. They will be available at the door. They are also available at both St. Joseph and St. Matthew parish centers or by calling Deb Schur at (860)585-6039.</p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
