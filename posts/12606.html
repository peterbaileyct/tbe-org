<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">A well-known schoolboy athlete, he lettered in basketball, baseball, and football. He was well remembered for a basketball shot against archrival Torrington High School. The Bristol team was down one point and at the sound of the buzzer, Roger sank a two-handed three-quarter court shot to win the game. He was carried off the court by his teammates. It is often a topic of conversation amongst friends to this day.</p>
