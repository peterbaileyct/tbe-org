<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BRISTOL - All the hard work Bristol Central softball standout Sophia Torreso put in the circle has certainly paid off over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season, Torreso and the Rams are on the verge of a Class LL state tournament berth as the pitcher helped her team wrangle up 21 wins over a banner campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in the circle, along with teammate Alex Sciarretto, the junior is one of the best pitchers the CCC has to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, Torreso was recognized for her pitching attributes as she was named to the Class LL All-State Softball team.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Pia joins sister Gwen in garnering All-State honors as the older Torreso earned the nod one year ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[It feels] pretty good,” said Torreso of the honor. “My sister last year, she got All-State so it feels good getting it too.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The All-State inclusion was a lock after an outstanding regular season of play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming into the Cheshire game - which was another victory for the junior standout - Torreso allowed just 35 hits over 66 innings pitched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She struck out nearly 150 batters and allowed just 14 earned runs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That earned run total falls to just eight when taking her loss to Southington out of the equation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her ERA of 1.48 is simply outstanding and before that setback to Southington, that number was hovering around 1.00 for most of the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso wrangled up four shutouts and has a no-hitter to her name in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She has had a monster season on the mound,” said Central coach Monica Hayes of Torreso.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso, of course, passes the credit to her teammates as her squad makes all the big plays behind her when she’s not striking out the side, allowing minimal hits, or simply frustrating opponents from the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The only reason I’m on this All-State team is because of my defense,” said Torreso. “I know that I can throw the ball inside and my third baseman is going to get it and make that play. I know we can make that double play.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not all about the pitching as her offensive game is coming along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She smacked out a huge double over the 3-1 victory against No. 12 Cheshire and is second on the squad in RBI this season with 18.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso also knows when and when not to swing the bat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“She has a keen eye for the strike zone with 15 walks,” said Hayes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has a strong battery and Torreso is extremely thankful for her teammate, catcher Lorelei Stancavage, behind the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She knows all the tendencies of Central’s pitchers and the Torreso/Stancavage duo looks like they’ve been playing together for over twenty years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chemistry between the twosome is simply off the charts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve just got to know what I can throw and how I can dominate the strike zone,” said Torreso. “And my catcher back there, Lorelei, she’s just insane. She’ll block anything for me. I don’t have to worry about something getting by her. Just between the pitcher and the catcher, you’ve got to have that bond together and we really have that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And knowing that my defense is going to play behind me and make those plays for me when the ball does get hit in the field, it just gives you a different level of confidence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And speaking of confidence, Torreso simply oozes it when she’s on the mound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torreso is a tremendous student athlete, has a keen softball IQ and is one of the programs leaders - on and off the field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s that supreme ability, with excellent mental focus, along with a talented array of players, that has helped make Torreso the All-State standout she’s become for the softball program over at Bristol Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My confidence is so high is because of my teammates,” said Torreso. “And they have confidence in me to be able to control the game.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in two years, perhaps the right Ivy League school will have the outstanding pitcher on its collegiate roster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there’s still plenty of more ball to play this year and into the summer before heading off to college.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On June 14, Torreso will take part of the Juniors All-Star game which is another feather in her cap and a tremendous accomplishment for the pitching standout.&nbsp;</p>
