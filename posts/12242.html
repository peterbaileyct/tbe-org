<p>BRISTOL - The Bristol Eastern boys track team is poised for a good season as a boatload of athletes are looking to compete in and around Alumni Field this spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers graduated just a handful of seniors from last year’s squad&nbsp; and expect those upperclassmen to lead the charge for the Kingstreeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Senior Carter Harris was a CCC South All-Conference performer last season along with Dante Marciano and then freshman Rashad Williams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have some returning athletes and a large number of athletes completely new to the sport,” said Eastern coach Paul Ryskowski.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last year, Eastern made a credible 15th place finish at the Class MM Outdoor Track and Field Championships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Logan Crowley did a tremendous job in the 800 meters as a junior, placing fourth in the event at the CCC Championship meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harris was excellent in the pole vault, seizing first place at the CCC’s as a junior with a successful attempt of 10 feet, six inches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Ryskowski is expecting big things from those two athletes and the senior class as a unit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A strong group of seniors are returning that will help lead this team throughout the season,” said Ryskowski. “Logan Crowley and Carter Harris are expected to lead the distance squad. Axel Agustin, Devin Gonzalez, and Maurice Chisholm will help lead the sprint groups. Lastly, the field events are expected to grow, and the coaches are particularly excited about some of the underclassmen jumpers.”&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern has a very busy slate of meets this season, starting with a trip to Meriden against Platt this Tuesday at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And every other Tuesday will be ‘game day’ for Eastern as the Lancers stay on the road in April for meets at Plainville (April 12), Maloney (April 19), and Lewis Mills (April 26) - all commencing at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in May, Eastern will have three consecutive home meets and won’t be leaving the Mum City until the postseason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Lancers will see Middletown (May 3), Berlin (May 10), and on May 17, it’s the annual crosstown battle against Bristol Central from Alumni Field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All those CCC South bouts will test the locals from the get-go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I'm excited to have a blend of youth and experience,” said Ryskowski. “Our team expectations this year are to grow as a track &amp; field team while competing for a conference championship. The personal expectations are for these student-athletes to run, jump, throw, and vault personal bests and to qualify for the championship season.”</p>
