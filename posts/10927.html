<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before going off on a tangent on starters playing long into the fourth quarter of a game that’s essentially over, the Bristol Central boys basketball team defeated Hartford Public by an 85-71 decision in Hartford on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After going 15-0 last season, the win against the Owls pushed the Rams to 12-0 overall this year with a big week on tap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The victory over the Owls was the program’s 27th consecutive win - the longest winning streak in Connecticut.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Central coach Tim Barrette, no fans were allowed at the venue and it was an extremely quiet gymnasium on the campus of Hartford Public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donovan Clingan led the charge with another incredible stat line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He pitched in 31 points, 16 rebounds, four assists, and seven blocks over another monster game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan notched all his assists and six of his seven blocks over first half of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He played in the first three quarters as when the game became a blowout, the starters were pulled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Rams were without the services of back-up guard Tre Blair and Public pressed Central’s second team into oblivion in the fourth frame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, Owls’ starters forced several turnovers to turn a significant deficit into a 14-point final.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it didn’t matter as Central moved to 12-0 on the year and continues its onslaught into the new week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rankings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of state rankings, the GameTimeCT Boys Basketball poll saw the Rams remain the number one team in Connecticut, entering the week at 10-0 and earning 18 of the 19 first place votes in the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Northwest Catholic (8-1) tallied the other first place vote and Barrette knows what kind of challenge the Lions could pose to Central come tournament time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Windsor, a future Central opponent, is ranked third while Wilbur Cross - another squad the Rams will tangle with - were rated tenth at 7-3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the state rankings are sometime subjective, the Rams sitting at No. 1 for the entire year to date seems a logical choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CIAC Division II standings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh my, what a surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol Central (12-0) is currently in first place of the CIAC Division II rankings with 54 power points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a position the squad spent in for most of the season apart from a short period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conard (third place, 11-1 overall, 55 power points) and Amity (ninth, 9-2, 37) were early leaders - along with the Rams - but other challengers are at the top of the Division II leaderboard to end the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Westhill (11-1) is in second place with 45 power points, Wilton (10-1, 53 power points) is fourth while Northwest Catholic (10-1, 52) lurks in fifth and is dangerous as any team out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How many teams are undefeated to start the week?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer is seven and Bristol Central is in that mix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Division I, Notre Dame-West Haven (14-0) and Naugatuck (12-0) are both undefeated while Central is the only perfect squad in Division II.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>RHAM (13-0) in Division III could be the surprise in the state but must contend with East Catholic, East Hartford, and Conard to end the regular season - not exactly a desirable schedule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Division IV sees Cromwell (11-0) and Bloomfield (10-0) without a loss and in Division V, Sports Medical and Sciences Academy (11-0) is perfect on the campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Leading Scorers at BCHS</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another landslide surprise, Donovan Clingan is still Central’s leading scorer, entering this week with a 26.0 points-per-game scoring average.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damion Glasper is second on the squad in scoring (11.75 ppg) followed by Carson Rivoira (8.7 ppg), Steven Alseph (7.8 ppg), Victor Rosa (4.4 ppg), and Julius Powell (3.4 ppg).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hitting the Three</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central has kicked in 48 total three-pointers this season with Glasper leading the charge at 12.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alseph snuck into second place with nine and Carson Rivoira is one behind (eight) in third - channeling his inner Larry Bird from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Mason Stokes is tied with that Clingan guy for fourth place with five 3s apiece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The five 3s by Clingan are a career high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bristol Scoring check</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Clingan dropped 31 points on Public, the future UCONN standout has 1,733 scholastic points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And in terms of simple addition and subtraction, he’s just 92 points away from the school scoring record - held by Martin Huckaby (1,825 points).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clingan needs just 103 points to become Bristol’s all-time leading scholastic scorer (Carey Edwards, 1,835 points).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using his current average of 26.0 ppg, it’s conceivable that Clingan sets a new record on February 7 at Lewis Mills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If not there, wouldn’t that be something to establish the new record against Windsor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Next Week…</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three games on the slate for the Rams this week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central takes its shot at Platt on Monday (6:45 p.m.) while traveling down to New Haven on Wednesday to battle Wilbur Cross from the Floyd Little Athletic Center at 8 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s going to be a big-time bout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then on Friday, Berlin travels to Bristol for a CCC South entanglement.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Game time is 6:45 p.m.</p>
