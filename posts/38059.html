<p>Come Sunday morning, Mary and I will have celebrated the 2-year-old grandchild's birthday on Saturday afternoon and then attended the 18th annual Holiday Showcase of Stars at St. Paul Catholic High School. Both events have, for their stars, kids--although the adults do fine at all of these celebrations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the 2-year old's party a gaggle of adults constructed the big toy, a construction site, in record time, so that the 2-year-old could run dump trucks and payloaders, backhoes and steam rollers, down ramps and over bridges, a little bit of heaven for his little heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The adults in the Showcase of Stars excelled, Maria Scalise, Christina Micari, Allen Stone and Silvio Dagastino. And the kids, especially the younger ones, say, ages 4-7, of course, steal the show--not because they are veteran performers hitting their marks. It is precisely because they aren't hitting any marks and are just being themselves, swaying to the music, pulling aside fellow performers--most likely a sibling--for a hug. </p>

<p>And when it gets past their bedtimes, yawning and rubbing their eyes--and bouncing back. Terrific.</p>

<p>Kudos to Deb Schur and her dedicated crew, who year after year put on a wonderful show, and raise funds for some local schools.</p>

<p>Thinking about local community variety shows and performances, I did a quick search and came across this website, curated by Ken Ferris, which provides video footage of Bristol Boys and Girls Club OM Shows. Click <a href="http://www.omshow.org/">here</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These shows are a wonderful proving ground, or petri dish (to mix metaphors), where a community gets to watch its members, young and old, develop and display their skills in a live performance venue. We are pretty lucky here in Bristol, especially with all the opportunities available to students, with the three high schools and their arts programs--and now with the Bristol Arts and Innovation Magnet School.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this these times of social media, live shows may play second fiddle to the small screens. Granted, social media has its place. There is no denying this, but there is no better place than on a stage to develop talent. Heads up--John Beardsley, a Bristol native, is bringing his Elvis show mid-month to The Rockwell. The response has been so wonderful that a matinee has been added to accommodate all the people who are interested.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Beardsley has been able to make a career with his talent, performance doesn't have to lead to a career. Live performance, in itself, develops a person and adds to community. These performances, when experienced together, give us all something to and someone to focus on for a moment--and often to feel good about.</p>

<p>Reading and listening this week begins with a Capitalism Isn't podcast, "How Big Law Firms Shape Capitalism, with David Enrich." Enrich is an award-winning investigative journalist, whose recent book is "Servants of the Damned: Giant Law Firms, Donald Trump, and the Corruption of Justice." </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The conversation is informative, at least for me, in that the author makes a distinction between legal defense of corporations versus that of individuals, but also because it provides a history of how law firms once comported themselves.

<p>New Haven pizza has been all the rage lately, beginning with a Connecticut magazine feature on the best pizza in the state earlier. The New Yorker features "The Lasting Pleasures of New Haven Pizza" by Hannah Goldfield, picking up where the Connecticut magazine piece left off, asking whether or not New Haven pizza can be replicated elsewhere? </p>

<p>Of course, there are wars raging. This week I received a link to the daily "Democracy Now" news program. To add to your knowledge of what is happening in the Middle East, especially, and ties to U.S. policy et, al,, this is one you might want to add to your list of news resources.

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p><em>Note: Donors may have to contact TBE if they find they are being limited, since we will need to set up a membership account for you.
