<p>The Bristol Blues of the New England Collegiate Baseball League opened its 2022 campaign with an 11-4 drubbing of the North Adams Steeple Cats on Tuesday night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol’s victory from Joe Wolfe Field in North Adams, Massachusetts saw the locals jump out to a 7-0 lead, never looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues were outhit 9-7 over the showdown but had a keen eye at the plate, scooping up 15 walks to help put men on base early and often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AJ Gaich, Bristol’s leadoff hitter, collected four base-on-balls, scoring twice, while David Christoforo paced the squad at the plate with two hits, including a double, and four RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cal Parrillo also had two hits while Andrew Calhoun and Calvin McCall both walked twice and nabbed two RBI apiece without the benefit of a hit for the Blues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cedric Rosa paced North Adams, going 3-for-3 at the dish, and had two of the squad’s four RBI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol starting pitcher Peter Ostensen went four innings and allowed just one earned run on four hits along with three strikeouts but did not factor into the decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Kohls took home the victory (2.1 IP, three hits, two earned runs) while Jay Harry posted the final two Ks in mop up duty to complete the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the bases loaded in the first inning, Bristol’s Derek Tenney was plunked by a pitch to net a run while Christoforo singled on – also generating a run – as the Blues led 2-0 out the gate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then Bristol put the game away in the second, leading 4-0 to that point, with a two-out rally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carson Swank singled on, Parrillo and Tenney then earned back-to-back walks before Christoforo cleared the bases with a blazing three-RBI double as Bristol’s 7-0 edge would be too much for the Steeple Cats to overcome in the end.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Blues stay on the road tonight to battle the Valley Blue Sox from McKenzie Stadium in Holyoke, Massachusetts at 6:35 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bristol opens the 2022 home portion of its schedule on Thursday against the Danbury Westerners from Muzzy Field.</p>

<p>Game time is set for 6:30 p.m. &nbsp;</p>
