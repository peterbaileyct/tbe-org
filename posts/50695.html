<p>Downtown Live is reviving the magic of classic cinema with its new Throwback Thursday Film series at the historic Rockwell Theater.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think the audience will like the chance to see the movies in Bristol again,” Arianna Theriault said.<strong> </strong>“As the Arts and Culture Supervisor, I try to find new and innovative ways to provide for the public, but I also want to make sure to include some things that I know locals miss from the past." </p>

<p>The 620-seat venue will showcase popular films from the 1980s and 1990s, offering a nostalgic experience for local moviegoers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"One of the major talking points I hear quite a lot is how we no longer have a movie theater in Bristol anymore," Theriault said, "so I'm happy to be able to provide this opportunity to our citizens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 2024 Throwback Thursday season will feature a lineup of cherished family favorites including "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Jurassic Park," "It’s a Wonderful Life" and "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial." Screenings will begin at 7 p.m. each Thursday, with tickets priced at just $5.</p>

<p>“Personally, I've never seen 'Jurassic Park' in theaters, so I'm thrilled we have that film,” Theriault said<strong>, “</strong>but I'm also very excited for 'It's a Wonderful Life.' This film has so many incredible messages and is a classic around the holidays and holds a very special place in many people’s hearts.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to Throwback Thursday Films, Downtown Live will screen two classic movies for $5 each at its annual Spooktacular bash on Saturday, Oct. 26. The spooky family favorite "Hocus Pocus" will be shown at 2 p.m., followed by the R-rated classic "The Terminator" at 7:30 p.m. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are hoping to make traditions at Downtown Live,” Theriault said. “Whether it be with films or premier live shows, and we are grateful for the publics support in our first year of operation. Our uniqueness is having something for everyone, and every age.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next $5 Throwback Thursday Film will be "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark" on Sept. 12<em>.</em> Doors will open 30 minutes before the show. Tickets can be purchased online or at the door. </p>

<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.                </li>
