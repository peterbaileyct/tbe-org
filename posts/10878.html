<p>The Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services (BPRYCS) department will be hosting a pop-up afternoon full of ice skating and hot chocolate at the Rockwell Park Lagoon this Friday. <br><br>The BPRYCS pop up ice skating event will take place on Friday, January 28 from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. During this time, the Rockwell Park Lagoon will be open for ice skating and Mrs. Rockwell’s Pavilion will be available for people to warm up at the fireplace, use the restroom, and enjoy a hot chocolate.<br><br>Amry Shelby, the department’s Recreation Supervisor commented, “Last year’s day of ice skating at Rockwell Park was extremely well received by those who attended. We’ve been monitoring the winter weather temperatures and ice conditions for over 6 weeks now, but at the end of the day, we’re at the mercy of Mother Nature. Now that we have had some colder weather, we are ready to take the ice again and look forward to seeing our community outdoors and enjoying what the parks have to offer.”</p>

<p><br><br>After hosting an extremely successful ice skating event last year, the BPRYCS department wanted to find a way to bring back Bristol’s beloved ice skating tradition in 2022. This winter has brought inconsistent weather patterns, with temperatures fluctuating above and below freezing. Bristol has finally seen consistent temperatures below freezing, allowing the lagoon to properly freeze and provide a safe environment for ice skating. <br></p>

<p>Page Park Pond was considered as a location for the pop-up event, but after checking ice conditions at the Page Park Pond, it was determined that Rockwell Park Lagoon was more suitable for Friday’s event.<br>Those attending this weekend should bring their own ice skates, as there are no ice skates to rent. </p>
