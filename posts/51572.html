<p>In a tale of two halves, the Lancers had more of the play in the first half, but were frustrated by the Plainville defense in the final third of the field.</p>

<p>"We defended well, allowing just one shot, and got the ball near the Plainville goal, but failed to put in a good shot." said Lancer coach Bill Sweet. "Our inability to finish has plagued us all year."</p>

<p>In the second half, Plainville gained more of the play, using sharp passes to get near the Lancer goal.  They were unable to score as the Eastern goalie, Connor Murtaugh, made two good saves and Lancer backs shut off passing lanes in the final third.   </p>

<p>However, with 25 seconds to go in the game, the Lancers took a corner kick that was headed directly to Plainville goalie Ian Bravado. He quickly got the ball out to Mario Cruz who passed to a speedy Cole Jones on the right side.  Jones took the ball over half field, raced down the right side, and hit a hard shot past Murtaugh with 18 seconds left on the clock.</p>
