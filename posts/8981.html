<p>On their last game of the regular season, the Lancer volleyball team celebrated Senior Night by honoring their three senior captains, Alex Shorette, Abby Jones, and Hannah Webber.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when the games began, it was those very same senior captains who led BE in a straight sets victory over New Britain Friday night.</p>

<p>The set scores were: 25-18, 25-22, and 25-20.</p>

<p>The Lancers did not play their sharpest game of the season. They probably had a little let-down after their big win over Bristol Central earlier in the week. But they were good enough to run their regular season record to 14-5 and earn the 8th seed in next week’s CCC Tournament. Eastern will host Plainville in the first round on Monday at 6:00 in the Lancer gym.</p>

<p>The three seniors led the way, as Webber had 22 kills and 3 blocks, Shorette had 3 kills and 2 aces, and  Jones set everything up with 31 assists, 5 digs, and an ace.</p>

<p><br>New Britain’s record dropped to 9-9 with the loss.</p>
