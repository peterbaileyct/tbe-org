<p>The Bristol Junior American Legion baseball team got its season off on a winning note on</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday as the program defeated Tri-County by a 3-2 final from Muzzy Field in Bristol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tit-for-tat performance by two very good opposing pitchers but in the end, Bristol Eastern’s Michael Roalf earned the win – throwing 5.2 innings of ball to seize the victory and help his squad earn a trip to the pay window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He threw 95 pitches over the winning effort while Ryan Maglio mopped up in the end for the save.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maglio needed 19 pitches over his 1.1 frames of work to stave off Tri-County (0-1) over exhibition play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Roalf/Maglio duo ended up throwing a combined six-hitter to lead Post 2 to the win but it was close throughout as either team could have roped up the victory in the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each team netted single runs in the first and second frames – making it a 2-2 contest before Bristol scratched a run across in the bottom of the third to snare the ultimate edge in the contest at 3-2.</p>
