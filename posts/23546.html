<p>Benny Christolini passed away peacefully on Feb. 23, surrounded by his family at the age of 93 after a sudden and brief illness. Benny was born in Bristol on May 12, 1929, to the late Louis and Clorinda (Scaramuzza) Christolini and attended Bristol Public Schools, graduating from Bristol High School in 1947.</p>

<p>He is survived by his devoted wife, Shirley (Parlow) Christolini, with whom he shared 67 years of marriage. He retired from the S. Carpenter Construction Company in 1991 after over 30 years of employment.</p>

<p>He took great pride in his family and is survived by his son Ben and his wife Teresa (Byington), daughter Karen and her husband Matt Hintz, and son John and his wife Kate (Sullivan). He was predeceased by his daughter Linda and her husband Dr. Robert Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Benny was a proud U.S. Army Veteran who served bravely under challenging circumstances in Korea during the Korean War. He loved a good trip to Mohegan Sun Casino with his family, and was fiercely independent, shoveling his own snow and mowing his lush, green lawn until his death.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bristol Edition will be limiting the number of stories non-members and free readers may access each week. This decision is based on our financial projections and, most certainly, to remind people that TBE is serious about providing accurate, timely and thorough reporting for Bristol. To do this we have devised a financial support structure that makes unlimited access extremely affordable, beginning with a $6 monthly donation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Non-members will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Free readers and people who have subscribed by email will be able to access four (4) articles per week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Donors and financial supporters will have unlimited access as long as they log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
